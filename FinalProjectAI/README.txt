DESCRIPTION:
Mini search engine

This program is a mini search engine for the muhlenberg.edu website, with simple menu.
Using text from crawled pages an inverted index is made from which an entered query can
produce results by Tf-idf ranking. Results are displayed as top 10 links to pages relevant to search.
Created as part of final project for AI college course.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:
- python3: can be acquired at https://www.python.org/downloads/
- python3 compatible IDE or .py file interpreter
- FinalProjectAI extracted files must share directory when executing
- Install nltk library: 'pip install nltk' in terminal or follow instructions on https://www.nltk.org/install.html

USE:
- Executing the SearchEngine.py successfully will result in a text menu with options
  after inverted index initialization message (patience is advised as initialization may take up to a few minutes).
  Here a selection between entering a search query or exiting the program are available.
  Additional queries can be searched after any given result.

TAL: Beyond Imagination
A World Premiere Circus Performance for Kids, Parents, & Everyone Else
Created by Atlas Circus Company
 

"A joyfully realized performance filled with mesmerizing circus acts! â¦ The aerial work is definitely an eye-popping highlight! â¦ the performers are all top-notch!" â The Morning Call
 
From the creators of last summerâs WILD comes a new all-ages circus experience â a tale of dreamers and eccentrics who gaze up at the stars in search of something more. Through high-flying aerial acrobatics, dance, juggling, comedy, and magic, TAL invites you along on a journey of imagination â to a world of color and wonder, where youâll experience the imagination of a child and the feeling of infinite possibility just within reach.
Groups welcome! Recommended for ages 4 through adult. Cast members will be available after daytime performances to meet the audience members, sign autographs, and answer questions.
 
FREE Imagination Workshops!
Stay after the show for a FREE 45-minute circus-themed Imagination Workshop! Join the cast to explore themes of the show through movement and storytelling â and learn circus skills! Daytime workshops are recommended for ages 4-12.

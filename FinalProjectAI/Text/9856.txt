COVID-19 Policies
Muhlenberg College's Theatre & Dance Department is committed to ensuring the health, safety, and comfortability of our campus community and all visitors, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Read below to learn more about what COVID-19 policies to expect during your time at our facilities and productions. Please note that any guests who do not comply with these policies will be asked to leave.
It is the responsibility of whomever purchases tickets to pass these guidelines along to any additional members of their party.  
Vaccination Policy
As of March 2022, patrons are no longer required to be vaccinated in order to attend a performance.
Mask Policy
Face masks, worn correctly, are required for all attendees at all times in our facilities. Muhlenberg College recommends wear of KN-95, N95, or K95 masks if possible.
If You Are Sick, Please Stay Home
If you are not feeling well, contact the Box Office by phone (484-664-3333) or by email (boxoffice@muhlenberg.edu) as soon as possible to release your tickets. Full refunds will be given to those who reach out to the Box Office prior to your event's start time.

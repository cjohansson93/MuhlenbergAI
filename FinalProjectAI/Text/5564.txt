chorney makes splashy steeple debut


People would say “Good job!” if you win a 3000m steeplechase race at a collegiate level meet with 12 participating schools, including six from Division I.

These same people would exclaim “Impressive performance!” if you break the school 



Chorney now has five school records: individually in the steeple and indoor 3,000 and in three relays (4x800 indoors and outdoors and 4x1600 indoors).



record by over 16 seconds, while coming within only 10 seconds of the NCAA provisional mark.

But what would they say if they found out 
that this was your first time running the race at an official event after you’ve specialized in mid-distance races not including 
hurdles?

We might direct this question to Muhlenberg junior David Chorney, who shattered the school record in his first-ever steeplechase, finishing first in 9:33.39 at the 
Greyhound Invitational at Moravian College. The old school record was 9:49.72, set by the similarly named David Chesny three years ago.

Chorney’s stunning performance was one of seven ECAC-qualifying efforts by the Muhlenberg track and field teams in an outstanding second-to-last meet before the
Centennial Conference Championships.

Sophomore Brendan Kirk set a new school standard in the 400m hurdles, finishing seventh in 55.16 and thus breaking his own record of 55.30, which he set last season.

Sophomore Jeremiah Lachaud took eighth place in the 200m dash with an ECAC-qualifying time of 22.44. Senior Michael Karchner was another Mule ECAC qualifier,
as he landed at 21-2½ in the long jump.

On the women’s side, sophomore Debra Crockett improved significantly her old personal best (38-7½) in the shot put with a 39-¼ toss to place third, thus qualifying 
for ECAC meet.
 
The 4x100m relay team of Lindsey Weidmann, Amanda Martini, Emily Karel and Lucy Brock also turned in an ECAC-qualifying performance, 
finishing in 52.10.

Sophomore Alex Faust, who had already hit the ECAC mark in the pole vault, bettered her season-best to 10-11¾.

Men’s soccer outslugs e-town


In a game where most of the players spent more time with their bodies flying through the air than with their feet on the grass, Muhlenberg men’s soccer was able to block out the distractions of a very physical match and shutout Elizabethtown 2-0.




Senior Brendan Carroll wins a head ball early in the first half.



“It didn’t take much to get us pumped up,” said senior Billy Dalton, who netted both goals for the Mules (5-2). “E-town is one of the only

The Muhlenberg volleyball team had its three-match winning streak snapped with a 3-0 loss to defending Centennial Conference regular-season champion Johns Hopkins.

teams we haven’t beaten in four years. It was nice to get out there and put a win up.”


Dalton scored both goals within 
11 minutes of each other, both in the early part of the first half. The first came just five minutes into the game, off a penalty kick after the Blue Jays (3-4-1) were called for a hand ball in the box.

After that first goal, every time Dalton had control of the ball, the student crowd began yelling, “Go Billy! Go get some! Get another one!”

“It’s always nice to get people to support us and we had a good crowd tonight,” said Dalton. And Dalton was faithful to his fans. His second goal came 15:48 into the game and was a rebound off the post from five yards out into the lower right corner.

The game was tight, with just a total of 15 shots taken, 10 of them by the Mules. There were 40 fouls, 23 by Elizabethtown. Elizabethtown had two yellow cards and one red. Muhlenberg also got a yellow card.

“E-town is always big and physical,” said Dalton, “so we were prepared for that. It’s tough to get through a game when there’s other stuff going on besides soccer, but we did a good job playing our own game.”

Student Travel Request
The Dean of Academic Life is accepting applications from students seeking to present, exhibit, or perform scholarly work previously completed or expected to be completed in the 2021-2022 academic year.  The project must be authorized by a faculty member.  You should consult with that faculty member about appropriate local, regional, and national conferences or other venues where you might present or perform.
Students who are interested in applying should fill out and submit the Student Travel Request Form, along with a typed abstract describing the project.  The abstract should normally be the same one you submit to the conference and should not exceed 500 words.  The language must be clear and precise.  You will want to have your faculty sponsor review at least one draft of the abstract. 
If you will be driving and need help computing the mileage cost, please email Ms. Lori Flatto at lflatto@muhlenberg.edu. 
Requests are due no later than April 30, 2022 for travel prior to June 30, 2022.  Funds will be distributed until gone.
You will be expected to send receipts to Ms. Flatto within two weeks of attending the conference.Please note:  If the project has not yet been accepted by the conference, travel support will be awarded pending acceptance.  Typically, Muhlenberg will only support one student trip per project, even if you have submitted your work to multiple conferences.

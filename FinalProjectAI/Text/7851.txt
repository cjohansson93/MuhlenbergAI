Cold Shooting Plagues Women's Basketball in Return

The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team struggled with its shooting and lost to DeSales, 64-51,
in its first game after final exams and its first home game in three weeks.

The Mules (3-5) shot just 25.7 percent from the field and 44.8 percent from the line, offsetting advantages
of 70-50 in shots taken and 53-38 on the boards.

Senior Leanna Tallamy (right) recorded her third straight double-double with 17 points and 13 rebounds (10 offensive),
while junior Christina Santone also had a double double, adding four blocks to her 11 points
and 11 rebounds.

The Bulldogs (6-3) shot 50 percent from the field, including 4-of-5 from three-point range, in opening up
a 39-28 halftime lead. The margin swelled to 17, at 57-40, with less than 12 minutes to go before Muhlenberg
stepped up its defense. 

The Mules held DeSales without a field goal for almost 10 minutes and went on a 10-0 run to make the score 57-50
with 6:45 to play. That’s as close as Muhlenberg would get, however, as neither team scored a point
until the Bulldogs hit a pair of free throws at the 3:57 mark.

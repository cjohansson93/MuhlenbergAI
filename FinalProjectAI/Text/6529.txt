Soccer Teams Split on Opening Night
 Friday, August 31, 2012 - page 2







					 



How long did it take Cody Antonini to re-acclimate himself to college soccer after taking a year off? About a minute.

Antonini scored just 65 seconds into the game, and the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team went on to defeat Elizabethtown, 3-2.




Way has scored a goal in five of his last six home games.



The last notes of the National Anthem had barely drifted away when Antonini dribble the ball across the box from the left side, turned and fired a shot into the
upper part of the net. It was the fastest goal for the Mules at the start of the season in at least the last 20 years, and the fastest at the start of a game 
since 2006, when Muhlenberg scored just 46 seconds in against New Jersey.

It was the 34th goal of Antonini’s career, moving him into a tie for seventh place on the program’s all-time list. 

The Blue Jays struck right back, however, netting the equalizer only 1:13 later. Muhlenberg went ahead for good when senior Danny Way beat several
members of the Elizabethtown defense and finished for his 23rd career goal.

The Mules struck quickly at the start of the second half too, with junior Jacob Joseph converting a pass from senior Nate Squire 
just 2:10 after the resumption of play. The 3-1 score held up until the Blue Jays netted a late goal.

While the men’s team thrived on early goals, one in each half, the women got only a late goal and fell to Wilkes, 2-1.

Senior Alyssa Meola headed in classmate Natalie Wizel’s corner kick with 3:50 to play, cutting
the Colonels’ lead in half, but Muhlenberg could manage only a long-distance shot in the remaining time.

The teams combined for only 12 shots in a game played mostly between the 18s.

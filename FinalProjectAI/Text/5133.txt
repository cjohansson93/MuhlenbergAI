deluca named ascholar all-american


Recent Muhlenberg graduate John DeLuca was named to the 2009 Scholar All-America Team by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA).

To be selected as a Scholar All-American, a student-athlete must be a Division I, II, or III All-American or a member of a North/South All-Star team, a student with
senior year academic standing and a cumulative grade point average of 3.0, and have behaved both on and off the field in a manner that has brought credit to himself, 
his institution and to collegiate lacrosse.

DeLuca qualified on all counts. He received USILA All-America honorable mention for the second year in a row and played in the North/South All-Star Game on May 22.
DeLuca, who graduated with an accounting degree, was named an Academic All-American as a football player in the fall.

Of the 58 total players from all three NCAA divisions who made the USILA Scholar All-America Team, 33 of them were Division III athletes. DeLuca was the only Centennial
Conference player honored on the squad.

A defenseman, DeLuca led the Mules with 19 caused turnovers, tied for the team lead with 34 ground balls and contributed to the offense with two goals and two assists in 2009. 
He finished his career with 94 ground balls and 12 goals.

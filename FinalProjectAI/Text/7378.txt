Women's Lacrosse Falls in CC First Round

A big first-half run by McDaniel ended the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team’s hopes of a deep postseason run.

The Mules took a 3-2 lead early in the opening period, but the Green Terror rattled off the next nine goals in a span of under nine minutes to take control en route to an 18-11 victory in the first-round Centennial Conference playoff clash. Fourth-seeded McDaniel advanced to meet tournament host and top seed Gettysburg in Saturday’s semifinals. Muhlenberg, seeking its first-ever playoff win, finished the 2014 campaign with a record of 10-7.

Two of the Mules’ standouts continued their climb up the school and conference record books. Senior Michelle Certosimo (right), who came in ranked fifth in Division III in assists per game, dished out five in her final collegiate contest. That gave her 70 for the season, just one shy of the CC record set in 2004. Certosimo finished her career with 212 points, tied for second all-time at Muhlenberg.

Junior Stephanie Umbach finished with a game-high six goals, giving her 88 on the year. Umbach finished the season one point short of 100. 

Sophomore Casey Armstrong and junior Kayleigh Thies scored two goals apiece for the Mules, while freshman Kelsey Nagle also found the back of the net. 

Freshman Sara Allison entered the game midway through the first half and made six saves, two of them on free-position attempts.

Senior Kaitlyn McCaffrey led Muhlenberg with three draw controls and two caused turnovers in the last game of her career. The veteran finished her tenure with 108 caused turnovers, one shy of the program’s all-time mark. Ally Shaffer, Anna Provax and Kelsey Mital also played their final game for Muhlenberg.

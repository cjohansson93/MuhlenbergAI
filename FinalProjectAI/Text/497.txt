 Laura Beth Reese
Thank you for the flowers
August 26 - October 20, 2019
 Lake Red Rock, 2016, Archival ink jet print
Martin Art Gallery is pleased to host Laura Beth Reese for her solo exhibition, Thank you for the flowers, in the Galleria space, located in our Phillip Johnson-designed Baker Center for the Arts.   Following her graduation from Muhlenbergâs Art Department in 2009, Reese continued her photographic practice in earnest, earning her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts/Tufts University.  In recognition of her unique relationship to the College, we are delighted to welcome Reese back, and will be hosting a reception for her during the Alumni/Reunion Weekend on September 21, where she will give a gallery talk on her exhibition, in addition to guest teaching at the College the following week.
Laura Beth Reese (b. 1987) holds an MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts/Tufts University and a BA from Muhlenberg College. Her work has been exhibited nationally-- recently at the SPRING/BREAK Art Show in New York, NY and the Colorado Photographic Arts Center in Boulder, CO. She was a 2016 recipient of the Traveling Fellowship from SMFA and she has been featured online at Feature Shoot and the Huffington Post, among others. Reese was born in Iowa and raised on the east coast of the United States. She currently resides in Boston, MA where she works at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and a teaching fellow at Harvard University.

Features
The Degree Audit is a computer program that reviews past and current student coursework and matches the courses with the requirements of his/her degree program or anticipated program, including units needed to graduate and GPA information.  It will show how the student's courses have been applied toward the degree and which courses the student still needs to complete.  The audit is divided into sections such as Major, Minor, and General Academic Requirements.  To be eligible to graduate from Muhlenberg College, students must fulfill the requirements in place when they begin at Muhlenberg.  The Audit will review the requirements based on each student's matriculation term, or the term s/he began at Muhlenberg.
Course Groups - This example is for the Dance major with a Dance Science concentration
Required Core Courses          4.50 Units               (DNC.CORE)             Core courses for the Dance major
Dance Science Required        2.50 Units               (DNC.SCI)                Dance Science courses for the concentration
Technique Courses                1.00 Units               (DNC.SCITC)           Dance Science technique courses for the concentration
Electives                               2.00 Units               (DNC.SCIELE)         Dance Science elective courses for the concentration
Culminating Undergraduate Experience     1.00 Unit     (DNC.CUE)
TOTAL of 11 courses required for the Dance major with a Dance Science concentration
The audit will indicate the completion status for each course group.
Complete:  student earned a passing grade for the course
In Progress:  student is currently taking the class and the final grade has not yet bee issued
AP/Dept Completed:  Advanced Placement or Departmental Exam
Transfer:  transfer coursework used to satisfy the requirement (NOTE that the grade is not used)
What If Cmplt:  no term is listed for this course because the course is not yet registered.
Cumulative Totals:
Required:  number of units toward graduation and major(s), etc.
Units Earned:  total number of units earned with passing grades, includes transfer work and AP
GPA Units:  attempted units which include failing grades but NOT passed (P) courses or transfer coursework
QTY Points:  quality points assigned to a letter grade (A = 4.0)
GPA:  divide the quality points by GPA units for major and overall GPA
If the student takes more than the required number of courses in the major, the audit will use the courses with the highest grades to satisfy each course group and determine the major GPA.
VARIANCE:  a major/minor department may use a course variance/substitution for a student.  This variance will allow a different Muhlenberg course, a transfer course, or a special topic course to satisfy a major or minor requirement.

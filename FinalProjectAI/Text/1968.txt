Overview
Muhlenberg College is a place of safety and welcome for all our students, faculty and staff, irrespective of their immigration status or national or ethnic origins. In accordance with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, this page is intended to provide resources and information to students as it relates to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). If you have any information that may be helpful to this site, please contact deanofstudents@muhlenberg.edu.

Support and Services


The College will continue to support the ability of qualified undocumented and DACA students to enroll and sustain their attendance, including doing everything within our power to use institutional funds and scholarships to fill gaps created by federal financial aid policies that exclude undocumented and DACA students from accessing ordinary financial aid and scholarships on equal footing with other students.


Unless required by law, the College will not assist immigration and immigration-enforcement authorities in investigative, apprehension, and deportation activities, nor will Campus Safety act on the behalf of such authorities. 


The College will work to protect the privacy of the status of any student, faculty or staff member; and we will, within the limits of the law, challenge requests for this type of information from any source. The College will also continue to comply with federal laws associated with such operations as student visas, employee hiring, and applications for federal financial aid.


Our Campus Safety department does not question anyone regarding their national origin or immigration status and that will remain our practice.

Additional helpful information for DACA students:
All DACA benefits are provided on a two-year basis, so individuals who currently have DACA will be allowed to retain both DACA and their work authorizations (EADs) until they expire.USCIS will adjudicate, on an individual, case by case basis:

Properly filed pending DACA initial requests and associated applications for employment authorization documents (EADs) that have been accepted as of Sept. 5, 2017.
Properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for EADs from current beneficiaries that have been accepted as of the date of this memorandum, and from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between Sept. 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted as of Oct. 5, 2017.

https://www.uscis.gov/daca2017In addition, the college would strongly advise that DACA students do not participate in study abroad experiences and other international travel opportunities for the foreseeable future.

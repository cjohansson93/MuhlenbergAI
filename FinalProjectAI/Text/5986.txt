Men's Golf Finishes Third on Home Course
 Monday, October 17, 2011







					 



Technically, there is no defense in the game of golf. No one is sitting in front of the cup trying to stop shots or intercept the ball.

But when the winds blow like they did during Monday's Muhlenberg Fall Invitational, it can feel like there is an entire line of defenders just trying to keep players from scoring.

Despite strong gusts that blew for much of the day, Muhlenberg battled through to still finish strong. With all four players finishing within five shots of each other, the Mules came in third in the team race at challenging Lehigh Country Club, narrowly missing out on second.

Leading the way was senior Zack Meyers (right) who carded an 82, which tied for fifth individually. His round was all the more impressive considering there was just one score in the 70s and only 16 players broke 85 on the blustery afternoon.

Muhlenberg’s team finish could have potentially been even better, but sophomore Chris DiMaio received an unlucky break on the 13th hole. 

After his ball bounced off a small hill on the side of the green, it disappeared under some leaves. While searching, DiMaio inadvertently stepped on his ball, which immediately cost him a penalty stroke. And when the final team scores were tallied, the Mules finished one shot behind second-place Penn State Harrisburg.

DiMaio did not let his misfortune ruin his round, however, as he regrouped to shoot an 84, which tied sophomore teammate Christopher Lucarelli for 12th overall.

Senior Jon Heppen rounded out the Mule contingent with an 87.

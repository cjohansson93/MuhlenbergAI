Courtney M. Stephens âAssistant Dean of Students & Director of Housing & Residence Life

I am currently in my fourth year at Muhlenberg, and from day one, have been fortunate to have the opportunity to work with and support our incredible college community. On a campus where everyone holds doors for one another, the food is delicious, and talented students work to achieve their dreams, it is this incredible atmosphere that keeps me coming back every day.
In my role, I work closely with the Housing & Residence Life staff to create a residential atmosphere that is safe, inclusive, and fun! I am fortunate to supervise a staff that is focused on making sure all of our residence halls are not only just somewhere to sleep and socialize, but also a space to learn and make lasting relationships. I also co-supervise Muhlenbergâs Director of International Student Support, work closely with students in my role as a conduct hearing officer, and am a member of BRET (Bias Resource & Education Team).
On a personal note, I am a proud alumna and Fightin' Blue Hen who graduated from the University of Delaware with a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services. I earned my Master of Arts degree in Higher Education Administration from the University of Michigan. I have previously worked at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am very lucky that my education and career has led me to Muhlenberg, where it truly feels like a home away from home.

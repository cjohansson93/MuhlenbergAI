We are dedicated to weaving writing into the community, and as such, we offer two distinct classes: Writing in the Schools and Writing in the Prisons.
Writing in the Schools offers students the opportunity to teach poetry to elementary children in inner-city Allentown through the Community-in-Schools after school programs. Muhlenberg students work closely with Professor Dawn Lonsinger. Offered most Spring semesters.
Writing in the Prisons offers students the opportunity to write creative nonfiction alongside residents/inmates at the Lehigh County Corrections Center (LCCC). Writing Minor students have the opportunity to assist Professor Miller in the class; and all Muhlenberg students may roster the class as a student. The class meets at the LCCC; transportation is arranged to the site. Offered most Spring semesters

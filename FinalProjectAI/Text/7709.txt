Women's Soccer Blanks Washington
 Saturday, October 11, 2014 - page 4







					 




The end to the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team’s winless streak was Taylor-made.

Junior Taylor Pini scored the lone goal early in the first half as the Mules defeated Washington, 1-0, to snap their winless skid at four. 

Muhlenberg (7-3-2, 3-2) has now won 17 straight against the Shorewomen (3-7-1, 0-4), the last 11 by shutout.

In the 10th minute, senior Colleen Touhey won a 50-50 ball at midfield and dribbled toward the goal before sending a through ball to Pini on her left. The goalie came out to challenge, and Pini (right) slotted the ball past her and inside the far post for her team-leading fourth goal of the season.

That was all the scoring, but the Mules controlled play for most of the remainder of the game and took 27 shots to only four for Washington.

Junior Jen Mermelstein made two saves for her fourth career shutout.

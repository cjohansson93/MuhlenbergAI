faust earns all-america honors again







The trip to Greencastle, Ind., for the NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships wasn’t the smoothest for Alex Faust and the rest of the Muhlenberg travel party. After flying from Allentown to Detroit, the Mules had to endure more than three hours of delays before their plane took off for Indianapolis.

At the meet, however, Faust had no trouble getting off the ground. Faust cleared 12-4 in the pole vault to tie for sixth place, earning All-America honors for the second time in her career.

Faust first was an All-American last spring, placing 



seventh at the 2009 Outdoor Championships. Her sixth-place finish is the best ever by a Muhlenberg female at an NCAA track meet, and she is the first athlete in program history (male or female) to earn All-America honors indoors and outdoors in the same event.

“I’m very happy,” said Faust. “I really wanted to place, but I knew the competition was a lot better than last year. I wanted to go higher, of course, but this will give me more motivation for the outdoor season.”

After missing her first vault, Faust cleared three in a row successfully, the last at 12-4. The bar was then moved up to 12-8, a half-inch higher than Faust’s best vault of the indoor season. She missed in all three attempts at that height.

“I switched poles for my last jumps,” she said. “I used my biggest pole at 12-4 and again at 12-8. I definitely need to practice more on the largest pole.”

The seven-time Centennial Conference pole vault champion will now turn her attention to the outdoor season, which is scheduled to begin at Lafayette in two weeks.

INE Course Decriptions
INE 101 - Introduction to Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Students explore the basic concepts in the continuing processes of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Students will explore how entrepreneurs identify opportunities in the market and validate their ideas with customers using the business model canvas and lean methodologies. The course explores what it means to be an entrepreneur and how to develop the âentrepreneurial mindsetâ  In the context of the entrepreneurial enterprise, some fundamental concepts from economics, accounting, budgeting, management, marketing, finance, and operations will be introduced.  Students will also explore the role of teams and networks in venture creation.  The course may include readings, speakers, videos, and case studies. Meets general academic requirement SL.
INE 201 - New Venture Creation (formerly Business Plan Development)
In this âentrepreneurial lab,â student teams will create a venture to produce a product or service that they deliver to the market. Students will investigate the competitive environment, conduct marketing analysis and surveys, develop requirements and/or prototypes, establish a supply chain and apply the components of successful strategies for marketing, production, finance, publicity, distribution, etc.  The practical components in this course will be supplemented by case studies and readings.  This course will enable students to gain a better understanding of team building and management through the creation of a functioning venture.  Meets general academic requirement SL. 
INE 350 - The Practice of Entrepreneurship (formerly INE 975 - Project Workshop)
As juniors or seniors, students will apply their knowledge and experience to fully develop a plan for a scalable venture opportunity. Topics covered will include advanced pitching, equity and ownership, legal structures and contracts, intellectual property, strategy and tactics, and financial statements and projections. Through the process of developing their venture plan students will subject their venture ideas to scrutiny and rigor to see if the business has a market and a niche, explore what short-, medium-, and longterm prospects for the business might be, discover, identify and contact appropriate allies and partners for the businessâ success, and develop channels and customer development processes necessary for the success of the venture. Students will prepare a final portfolio showcasing their learning and plans for their venture. Meets general academic requirement SL.
ELECTIVES:
INE 285 (INE 211 when offered as IL): Entrepreneurship in the Arts
âYou canât make a living as an artist!â  Now, more than ever, these âwords-of-wisdomâ given âround the dinner table by your elders no longer hold true. In the 21st century, the opportunities to live as an artist and maker are ever more available to those who choose to pursue them.
In this course, we will explore how an entrepreneurial mindset can help todayâs artists see themselves as entrepreneurs who generate artistic, social, and economic value. Whether itâs setting yourself up for success in the gig-economy or developing an innovative venture with an artistic focus, this course will challenge you to use your creativity and adaptability to make the career you want for yourself in the arts.
INE 215 - The Business of Booze: Entrepreneurship in the Craft Beverage Industry 
The last 40 years have seen the birth and blossoming of a robust craft beverage industry in the united states. From brewpubs to urban wineries, from meaderies to wholesalers, from distilleries to cideries, the beverage space has exploded with opportunities and failures. This course will go into the nuts and bolts of this vibrant and chaotic industry, looking at a variety of business models and cases. Weâll explore the checkered American history of alcohol, and wrestle with the societal effects of selling a legal toxin that is old as human society itself. We will also explore equity issues within the industry. Meets general academic requirement SL.
Many other electives are offered in the program on a one time or rotating basis.

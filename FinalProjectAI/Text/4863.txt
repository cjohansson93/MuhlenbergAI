time runs out for baseball in florida


The Muhlenberg baseball team played both “spring ahead” and “fall back” on clock-changing day, but in the end it was Central that had the final stroke.

The Mules rallied twice to tie 




Sophomore Jesse Nusbaum singled in the first run of the game.



in the late innings before the Dutch plated a run in the bottom of the ninth to win, 8-7. The loss ended Muhlenberg’s trip to Vero Beach, Fla., with a 4-4 record.

Not too long after finishing up their day-night doubleheader against 
Daniel Webster – a turnaround made shorter by the start of Daylight Savings Time – the Mules jumped on the board with three runs in the top of the first, highlighted by a two-run single off the bat of sophomore Brian Beck. Central came back to tie the score in the 
third and took a 6-5 lead with three runs in the bottom of the fifth.

Then it was time for Muhlenberg to come from behind. In the top of the seventh, three consecutive singles from senior Dan Fisher, freshman Steve Alfano and 




Fisher dives back into first on a pickoff attempt. He hit .548 in Florida with 17 runs scored in eight games.




senior Eric Pomroy brought home the tying run.

Central went up 7-6 in the bottom of the eighth, and with time running out, the Mules repeated their seventh-inning comeback. Literally. With two out and nobody on, the same three players who had delivered the game-tying run in the seventh – Fisher, Alfano and Pomroy – came through a second time, again with three consecutive singles.

The Dutch won the game in the bottom of the ninth on an infield hit and two more singles.

The top three in the Muhlenberg lineup were a combined 11-for-13, with Pomroy going 4-for-4, Fisher 4-for-5 and Alfano 3-for-4. Beck added two hits.

season competing for the Muhlenberg men’s track and field team. 

Karchner almost doubled his 289-point lead from day one of the championships, capturing the gold medal with a total of 5892 points, 568 in front of the second-place competitor. Muhlenberg’s senior Paul Kegelman improved his position from seventh to fifth, accumulating 3910 points.

Indefatigable 

Karchner not only brought a title for the Mules, but also scored 

two more team points in the long jump with his seventh-place finish and qualified for tomorrow’s final in the 110m hurdles along with classmate Adam Carter.

Simons, here taking the baton from Bier, posted the third-fastest qualifying time in the open 800.



Championships, the men’s and the women’s teams turned in three school records on the second day of the meet and qualified 13 athletes (nine men and four women) for Sunday’s finals. 

In a spectacular 3000m steeplechase race, in which the top eight finishers improved their season bests, junior David Chorney shattered his own school record by over five seconds in his only second time running the event as he placed third in 9:27.79.

Sophomore Jeremiah Lachaud broke a dusty 13-year school record in the 200m as he crossed the line in 22.14, earning the right to run in the finals.

The third new school standard was set by the young 4x800m relay team of freshmen Abby Simons, Hannah Mitchell and Kim Bier and sophomore Lauren Conicella, which ate up over 13 seconds of the old mark as they finished third in 9:36.85.

Following the women’s example, the 4x800m Muhlenberg men’s relay team of Chris Dolan, Bobby Torphy, Chorney and Patrick Thornton also claimed podium position, placing third in 8:06.65.

Torphy and Thornton also turned in ECAC-qualifying times in the 800m as they also qualified for the CC final tomorrow.

In the women’s discus throw, sophomore Debra Crockett took fifth spot with a toss of 115-4.

After the second day of the meet, both Muhlenberg teams occupy fourth position in the standings after seven scored events.

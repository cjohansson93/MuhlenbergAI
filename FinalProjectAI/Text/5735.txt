hoops teams head into thanksgiving
with losses


The Gettysburg women’s basketball team outscored Muhlenberg 38-22 in the second half to come from behind and win the Centennial
Conference opener for both teams, 71-57. It was the Bullets’ first win in Allentown in 13 years. 

The Mules started slowly and were down 28-18 before going on a 13-0 run,
sparked by three three-pointers from sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley, late in the first half to take their first lead. A short jumper by freshman Kelly McKeon at
the first-half buzzer sent Muhlenberg into the locker room ahead by two, but the Mules shot just 28.6 percent in the second half. 

O’Malley finished with a career-high
15 points, and McKeon had nine points and six assists.

The men’s team overcame an early 12-point deficit to take a five-point lead with less than four minutes to go, but Drew ended the game on a 9-0 run to win, 51-47.

Muhlenberg trailed 21-9 with six minutes left in the first half before going on a 12-1 run to close out the first 20 minutes. The Mules eventually took their first lead
at the 11-minute mark when sophomore Ryan Foster drilled a three-pointer. They took their biggest lead, at 47-42, on three free throws by junior Mike
Bernardini, but did not score the rest of the way.

Foster finished with 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting. Sophomore Peter Barnes blocked seven shots, one short of the school record.

liddic named to academic team



Sophomore Spencer Liddic of the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division 
team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. He was a second-team selection.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team. 

A double major in business administration and finance with a concentration in entrepreneurship, Liddic is the leading scorer (14.0 points per game) and 
rebounder (10.5 per game) for the Mules, who are currently in second place in the Centennial 
Conference. Entering last night’s games, he led the CC in rebounding and ranked seventh in scoring  and fifth in blocked shots.
A big part of a defense that ranks in the top 10 in Division III in field-goal percentage defense and rebound margin, Liddic leads the CC with nine double-doubles, including
a 24-point, 19-rebound effort against Swarthmore last night.

Off the court, Liddic is a member of the Business and Economics Club and serves on the Career Center Committee. He also is a tutor in economics, physics and statistics.

Liddic is the first Muhlenberg men’s basketball player to earn Academic All-District honors since 1999.

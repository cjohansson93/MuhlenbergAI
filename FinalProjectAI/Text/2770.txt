madeira reaches 300-win milestone


Like any good coach, mens basketball coach Dave Madeira has his quirks. He makes his players take off their hats inside. 
He sits more than he stands, but that doesnt mean hes less intense, as his chair usually ends up about half a foot in front of all the others. 
When he does stand up, he pulls up his pants and tucks his shirt in further. Sometimes he scratches his nose. 
Maybe it just itches, but junior Ryan Foster hit a three-pointer after he did it. 

In Muhlenbergs 77-68 win over Hood in the first round of the Greyhound Starters Classic, the Mules earned Madeira his 300th career victory. 

And like any good coach, kept the focus on his players. 

When they announced it, it was only the second 


time I was hearing about it, said sophomore Evan Tozer. 
My dad mentioned at the beginning of the season that he was going to reach it. Coach Madeira didnt say anything. Hes always like that. 

The game started out with an omen as the first shot of the game was a Foster three-pointer six seconds in. The Mules (5-2) led by as many as six before 
Hood capitalized on some turnovers and jumped out to a 10-point lead with 6 minutes left in the half. Muhlenberg then went on a 12-2 run to tie the 
score at 29 apiece. A three-pointer and layup by Tozer gave the Mules a 34-33 lead at the half. 

The second half was close all the way, with the Blazers (3-7) taking a one-point lead with 8:29 left. The score was tied at 56 before Tozer hit a 
three-pointer at the 6:15 mark to put Muhlenberg ahead for good. Two more three-pointers, both by Foster, enabled the Mules to pull away.

Foster had 22 points and 10 rebounds for his second career double-double. Tozer added a career-high 18 points, while junior Peter Barnes 
had 10 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked shots and junior Brian Frankoski scored 11. The Mules allowed Hood only four offensive rebounds and
held a 41-25 edge on the boards.

The Mules, who are 9-0 all-time in first-round games at Moravian’s tournament, will play the host school, an 85-74 winner over Moravian, in the
final. The two teams met on December 15, with Muhlenberg winning 69-54.

It was a good 300th win, said Foster of the game. We came back and only had two days to prepare for a team we had never seen. 

Thanks to Madeira. 

He really prepares us in practice so were not shocked going into a game, said Foster. 

Hes really dedicated, said senior Chris MacIntosh. He puts a lot of effort into scouting reports and looking at film and he puts 
everything he can into practice. 

Madeiras players describe his coaching style as reserved, but they know his quiet nature doesnt mean hes not fired up. In the Hood game, 
Madeira let a ref know what he thought about a few foul calls on the Mules. When he does get vocal, his players know he means business. 

Hes usually patient, said Foster. But when he does get mad, it comes out of nowhere and he lets us know hes not messing around." 

Hes an all-around good guy, said Tozer. He looks out for our best interest and really takes care of us. 

In his 22nd season at the Muhlenberg helm, Madeira has a career record of 300-238 (5-2 this season). 
He is the winningest coach in the College's athletic history. Including five years as an assistant coach, Madeira has been on the bench for 391 Muhlenberg wins.

And like a good coach, Madeira understands there is a world outside of basketball. 

He talks about things that affect you on the court, but also off, said Foster, things that can help you be a better person. 
Thats what he wants to do. He really cares about his players.

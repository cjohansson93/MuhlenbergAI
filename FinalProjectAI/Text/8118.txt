Wallenberg Tribute
Raoul Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Budapest Jews from the Nazis during the last year of WWII. He was taken into Soviet custody just days after Budapest was liberated and was never again accounted for by Western sources; some Soviet reports put his death in 1947 in a Moscow prison. Each year since 1984, Muhlenberg College and the Institute have paid tribute to Raoul Wallenberg by honoring one or more individuals who are recognized for their courageous moral action on behalf of others.
The annual Wallenberg Tribute includes a public lecture and reserved seating dinner. If you would like to be added to the mailing list to receive an invitation, please email us at religionandculture@muhlenberg.edu.

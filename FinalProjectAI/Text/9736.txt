The Muhlenberg College Honors Convocation, which was held this year at 8 p.m. on Thursday, May 13, is a formal academic ceremony designed to honor and celebrate leadership and scholarly excellence and achievement.
Faculty were named recipients of The Class of 1932 Research Professorship, The Donald B. Hoffman Research Fellowship, The Robert C. Williams Faculty Award, The Ruth and Joel Spira Prize for Distinguished Teaching, The Award for the Outstanding Advisor to First-Year Students and The Faculty Rising Scholars Awards.
Staff were honored with The Chairmanâs Award, the Hamre Prize and the Student Government Award.

Jill Stephen, professor of English, delivered the faculty address, titled âWeâre Building the Ship as We Sail It.â In her message to the students, faculty and staff who were honored, she encouraged students to reflect on their time at Muhlenberg and to think back on what strategies they utilized to remain hopeful and inspired.
"I wish to celebrate not just the knowledge youâve acquired, but the habits of mind, the ways of thinking that all your hard work as students has been teaching you," said Stephen. "As a teacher of poetry, Iâm drawn to a particular way of using words: metaphor. Simply put, metaphor is a way of thinking by analogy. We come to understand a thing that we canât quite name by noticing something else that seems to embody it. Paying attention to metaphors helps us to recognize not just what we know, but how we have come to know it...May we relish still, cherishing the things we care most about. May we find the language we need, especially the metaphors that will guide us."

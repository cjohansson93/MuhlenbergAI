In Exchange for Gold features dozens of digital photographs by Muhlenberg College professor and art department chair Joseph E.B. Elliott.  His work was produced in collaboration with fellow professor Dr. Richard Niesenbaum,   department chair of science and director of the College’s Sustainability Studies Program.  Niesenbaum has been working on community sustainability issues in Las Juntas since 1997.  After Elliott, who has been exploring industrial themes since the 1980s,  joined him in 2004, they proceeded to use a time-honored liberal arts approach--incorporating both art and science--to comprehensively document the historical, cultural and environmental facets of this gold mining community.
Mining in this area began in the late 1880s by American businessman Minor Cooper Keith and thrived through the 1920s, then crumbled during the worldwide economic distress of the 1930s.  Although gold mining in the Las Juntas de Abangares region never returned to robust production, it never completely ended.  Currently, despite lacking the capital to provide a modest level of workplace and environmental safety, young and old miners carry on the tradition at great risk to their personal health, to the health of their families, and to the well-being of their town.
To visually document the Las Juntas story, Elliott provides crisp black-and-white images of working miners, shop owners, and families who have lived there for generations.  Juxtaposed against that gray palette are richly colored images that place the town in clear context and highlight the lush, local flora and varied terrain.  Photographs by Carolyn Blake, a Muhlenberg student who participated in this year’s visit, round out the visual narrative.
The Martin Art Gallery is located in the Baker Center for the Arts.  All exhibitions and programs are open the public and free of charge.  Hours: Tuesday through Saturdays, noon – 8 p.m.; closed during major holidays and semester breaks.  Information: 484.664.3467.

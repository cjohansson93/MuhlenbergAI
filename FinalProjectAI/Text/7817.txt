Flank Posts Highest Finish at Nationals
 Saturday, November 22, 2014 - page 3







					 




Jaryd Flank’s first trip to nationals was a success.

The sophomore on the Muhlenberg cross country team placed 92nd out of 280 runners at the NCAA Championships. That
is the highest finish ever for a Muhlenberg male at the NCAA meet. The previous best was 94th by Will Elson in 2002.

Flank also had by far the best national finish by a Mule sophomore. He was only the third Muhlenberg sophomore
to qualify for NCAAs and the first to do so as an individual. The previous two were members of the 2006 team
that qualified, and neither placed higher than 209th.

Flank’s finish also was the best by a Muhlenberg runner, male or female, on their first trip to the NCAA
Championships. Samantha Mayden’s all-time best 67th-place showing in 2012 came a year after she came in
211th.

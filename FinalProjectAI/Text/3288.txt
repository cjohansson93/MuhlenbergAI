women’s soccer, field hockey fall on road



The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team was tied with third-ranked Messiah with 10 minutes to play, but the Falcons put in two late goals to defeat the Mules, 3-1.

The loss ended Muhlenberg’s winning streak at six games, dating back to last year. 

Messiah (6-0-1) had a 33-3 advantage in shots, but the Mules (5-1) stayed in the game thanks to the efforts of junior Kate Morrissey (right), who made a career-high
10 saves. The Falcons broke a scoreless tie with a header off a corner kick just 4:20 into the second half. Muhlenberg came back to tie the score about six minutes
later when junior Christina O’Grady knocked in just the third goal allowed by Messiah this season.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team suffered a tough 1-0 loss at Drew in its first road game of the year. The Mules (1-4) took twice as many shots as the Rangers but could not put one in, although they came close.

Less than 10 minutes into the game, a Muhlenberg shot hit the post, and moments later a penalty stroke was saved. 

Drew (5-2) scored the lone goal with 4:53 left in the first half. Less than five minutes into the second half, the Mules narrowly missed tying the game, forcing a defensive save.

Muhlenberg kept the pressure on in the second half, winning seven penalty corners, but came up empty and was shut out for the first time this season.

Vaughn Shines in Final Game but Football Falls to DelVal
 Saturday, November 17, 2012 - page 3







					 


Isaiah Vaughn had a sensational game for the Muhlenberg football team in the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl, gaining 218 all-purpose yards on only five touches, but it was a different touch that was the subject of debate at the end of the game.




Vaughn finished the season averaging 21.0 yards per catch.



Delaware Valley took control with its running attack in the second half and won the postseason game, 24-21. Both teams finished the season with a record of 8-3.

The Mules cut a 24-14 lead to three when Vaughn scored his third touchdown of the game on a 40-yard reception with 3:24 left in the fourth. Freshman Matt Pagano recovered the ensuing onside kick to give Muhlenberg the ball near midfield with a chance to tie on a field goal.

On first down, junior Joe Carlucci threw the ball deep downfield for Vaughn. The Aggie defensive back appeared to push off Vaughn before intercepting the pass. The referees conferred and ultimately decided to uphold the interception, giving the ball to the Aggies inside their 5-yard line. 




Junior Kory Crichton (50) recorded six tackles and sophomore Jeremey Thomas (25) had eight; they combined on this one.



Two plays later, a 72-yard run sealed the win for Delaware Valley.

The Aggies got off to a quick start, scoring a touchdown on a 38-yard run on their third play from scrimmage. But Vaughn returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards to tie the score with less than five minutes elapsed – this from two teams that combined to produce no touchdowns in regulation in their regular-season meeting last year.

The 96-yard kickoff return was the longest by a Mule since 1984, and it was the second career play of at least 95 yards for Vaughn, who caught a school-record 95-yard touchdown pass last year.

Vaughn also caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Carlucci with 8:07 left in the first half, giving the Mules their first lead at 14-10.

Delaware Valley controlled the clock in the second half, holding possession for more than 23 of the 30 minutes. The Aggies went ahead with a touchdown in the third and added another score on the first play of the fourth quarter.

Muhlenberg did not gain a first down in the second half until its touchdown drive, when it got three in a row, the last coming on Vaughn’s 40-yard TD catch.

“It’s bittersweet,” said Vaughn of his performance. “You want to come out in your last game and get the win, and I 
feel like we played hard enough. We just came up a little bit short.”

Sophomore Ian Gimbar made a game-high 13 tackles, including three for loss and 1½ sacks, finishing the season with a school-record total of 14½ sacks.

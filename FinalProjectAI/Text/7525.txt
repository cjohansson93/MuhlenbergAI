Softball Splits, Women's Lacrosse Drops Thriller
 Saturday, April 5, 2014 - page 3







					 




The Muhlenberg softball and women’s lacrosse teams both found themselves on the wrong side of thrilling endings against 2013 Centennial Conference playoff teams.




In her last five starts, all wins, Jones has allowed only two runs in 35 innings.



Softball split a doubleheader at McDaniel, winning the first game 1-0 behind the five-hit pitching of Kelsey Jones. The junior tossed her fourth shutout of the season, improving her record to 8-1 and lowering her ERA to 0.93. Jones struck out only one and did not allow a runner past second base.

The Mules (14-4, 6-2) gave her the only run she would need in the first inning. Senior Erica Wenzel drew a one-out walk and raced to third on a double by classmate Kelly Kline – her school record-tying 36th career two-bagger. Wenzel scored on a passed ball.

In the nightcap, Muhlenberg took a 2-0 lead in the top of the sixth on a two-run homer by sophomore Brittany Dzieciolowski. The Mules were one out away from completing a doubleheader shutout, but the Green Terror (11-9, 3-3) tied the game on a two-out, two-run triple in the seventh and won it, 4-2, on a two-run walkoff homer in the eighth.

Women’s lacrosse, meanwhile, dropped a 13-12 decision against Washington College, which netted the game-winner with 15.4 seconds remaining.

Junior Stephanie Umbach netted six goals for the Mules (7-4, 1-3), including one on a free-position shot that gave 
them a 12-11 lead with just over five minutes to play. But the Shorewomen (6-3, 2-1), ranked in the top 25 in Division III by 
laxpower.com, equalized with 2:38 to play before their last-second clincher.

Senior Michelle Certosimo had a goal and dished out six assists for the fourth time this season. The other member of the Mules’ three-headed monster, sophomore Casey Armstrong, added two goals, two assists and seven draw controls. 

Umbach scored at least six goals for the fourth time this year. Two of them came during a stretch of three consecutive goals that 
sent the Mules into the half with an 8-6 advantage. Washington regained the lead at 10-9 with 13:23 to play, but Muhlenberg quickly 
snatched it right back on consecutive goals by senior Ally Shaffer and junior Kayleigh Thies. 
The Shorewomen pulled even again with just under seven minutes to play before the intense finish unfolded. 

Sophomore Kiersten Mulvey (right) was stellar between the pipes, making a career-high 15 saves to keep the score close despite a 37-24 deficit in shots. Many of them were at point-blank range, and two came on free-position shots.

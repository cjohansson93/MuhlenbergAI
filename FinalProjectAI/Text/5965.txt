Men's Soccer Back to Winning Ways; Women Lose Heartbreaker

Dickinson Wins on Late Goal



For more than 89 minutes, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team controlled its game with Dickinson.

At that point, the Mules held an 11-4 advantage in shots and only allowed one on goal. But they were still locked in a scoreless tie as they pressed for a goal in the final minute. That’s when the Red Devils, ranked sixth in the region, took advantage with a quick clear.

With most of the Mules deep in the offensive end, the Red Devils beat them down the field and put in the heartbreaking goal with just 24 seconds left for a 1-0 win.

Muhlenberg thought it had taken the lead on a shot from sophomore Susan Galgano in the 50th minute, but the apparent goal was waived off by an offside call.

There’s no place like home.

After tough road trips to Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore (who have combined for the last five Centennial Conference championships), the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team returned to Varsity Field and snapped its two-game skid with a 2-0 win against Haverford.

One goal early and one goal late were all the Mules (6-2, 2-2) needed against 

the Fords (3-6, 0-4), who had not lost a game by more than a goal this season. One of their one-goal losses was to top-ranked Messiah.

The early goal came a little late, as Haverford’s bus broke down en route to the game, resulting in a delay of more than a half hour. Once the game started, Muhlenberg took advantage of a breakdown in the Haverford defense. Senior Josh Luginbuhl got a free header of a long cross from classmate Steve Giannacio and put it past the goalie just 93 seconds in.

Muhlenberg took four shots in the first 10 minutes and six in the first 26, then went more than 60 minutes of game time without taking another. Haverford didn’t do much more shooting; in fact, neither team recorded a shot in the rainy second half until just over 11 minutes remained. 

Finally, with the Fords pushing up in an attempt to score the equalizer, junior Danny Way found an opening in the middle of the field and one-hopped a shot off the wet grass for his fourth goal of the season with 3:31 to play.

Junior Ari Nutovits needed to make only three saves to earn his fifth shutout of the season. He was helped out by freshman Bryan Attanasio (left), who made a nice slide tackle to break up a Haverford flurry in the 67th minute.

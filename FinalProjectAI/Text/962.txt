Courses
BIO 152 Principles of Biology III: Molecules and CellsThe third course in the introductory biology sequence. Study of the relationship of structure and function at the molecular and cellular level, molecular and Mendelian genetics, and microbiology. Three class hours and three laboratory hours per week.
BIO 180 Theory of EvolutionThe theory of evolution was developed in order to explain the nature of biological diversity, and was substantially expanded and revised during the 20th century. This course examines how scientific theories are developed, tested, and revised, with a focus on evolutionary theory in particular. The role of imagination, inductive and deductive reasoning, and experimental analysis will be explored through selected readings from the works of Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and others. The course will emphasize the importance of modern genetics in confirming evolutionary theory and address topics such as natural selection, speciation, genetic drift, selfish DNA, and human evolution. This course is intended for non-science majors and does not satisfy requirements for science major programs.
BIO 215 GeneticsStudy of genetic analysis in the four main branches of genetics: classical genetics, molecular genetics, population genetics, and genomics. Experimental approaches, human genetics, and model systems are emphasized. Topics include mutations, gene interactions, chromosomes, quantitative and evolutionary genetics, gene mapping, gene cloning, and genetic engineering. Three class hours, and three laboratory hours.
BIO 472 Genomes and Gene EvolutionA central question that remains in biology is the relationship between genetic changes at the DNA level and evolution of organismal form and function. This course considers gene structure and function both within and across genomes. Animal development will serve as a primary context in which to explore comparative, regulatory, and functional genomics. Lecture and discussion features review of primary literature and use of bioinformatics tools; laboratory experience centers on DNA microarray technology. Developed with Dr. Amy Hark and taught in alternate years.
BIO 412 Molecular BiologyA topical course investigating the techniques and applications of recombinant DNA. The course provides a detailed treatment of recombinant methodologies such as gene cloning strategies, and considers the process and implications of science throughout. Topics covered include gene regulation, gene organization, and the molecular aspects of development and cell biology. Three class hours per week. CUE course.
 
Research
 
My lab studies genes that function in the development of the nervous system of the very small nematode . This project provides research opportunities for Muhlenberg College students during the semester (for credit) and during the summer (for pay). For more details on this project, consult the Wightman Lab research description. For descriptions of the lab and student projects, consult the Wightman Lab page.

Random Details
I was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up not far from Allentown in scenic Nutley, N.J. I've lived in Cleveland, Boston and Berkeley, before coming to Muhlenberg. I like spending time with my wife and kids, hiking, canoeing, American history, music (espeically Americana and English Folk-Rock), microbrew (at night) and strong coffee (in the morning). My heroes include Richard Thompson, Ryan Adams, and Dave Rawlings.

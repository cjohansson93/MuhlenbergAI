Fall 2021 Semester Update
Thursday, May 13, 2021

Dear Faculty and Staff,
The Fall COVID Planning committee has been meeting since early March, and is happy to offer an update on the work accomplished thus far. There are still many items underway and work will continue throughout the summer. It will continue to be important that we remain flexible and have contingency plans as we continue to monitor the virus.
First and foremost, we want to recognize and thank the committee members for their ongoing commitment to this work. This semester, the committee was composed of key administrative staff from Seegers Union, Housing and Residence Life, the Health Center, Human Resources, GCE, and the Provostâs Office. In addition, there were faculty representatives from FPPC, APC, and CCTDL. The group started its work by reaffirming the core principles that have guided College planning since the outset of the pandemic. In addition, the group made some additions and adjustments to further emphasize emotional well-being, shared governance, and the role of digital learning at the College. These guiding principles served as the foundation for our work together and will remain at the front of our minds as we move forward.
Second, we would like to share some of the key recommendations that are already completed or that are underway.
The overarching recommendation of the committee, which was recently shared in a community message, is that we return to our full residential community in Fall 2021. We look forward to being on-campus together to live, learn, and engage in community with one another. Faculty will return to in-person teaching, bringing into those spaces many of the digital practices and tools that enrich participation and presence for all students. Students will return fully to a residential experience to engage in-person in advising, office hours, clubs, organizations, performances, athletic events, and community engagement opportunities â all of which are the hallmarks of the Muhlenberg experience. Together in residence, we will continue to prioritize health and safety and to creatively address the challenges of the pandemic.
Specific fall planning group recommendations for the fall also include:
Health and Safety

Require the COVID vaccine for all students and strongly encourage vaccinations for employees and continue to investigate the benefits of incentives and/or a requirement;
Develop a âRequest for Remote Learningâ policy and process for students with extraordinary medical or personal circumstances;
Mask wearing will continue at all times in all indoor spaces on campus. We will continue to follow CDC guidance with regard to outdoor spaces and events;
COVID testing will still occur for students before arrival and at regular intervals for the first part of the semester and then will be reduced as appropriate after sufficient negative baseline data has been established. Students who are not able to be vaccinated because of an exception will test more frequently through the health center.

Academic Expectations, Digital Learning and Student Re-orientation

Develop clear in-person student attendance expectations to be shared broadly by the Provost, faculty and the Dean of Academic Life as part of student re-orientation in the fall;
Develop a short-term temporary medical leave policy to support students in isolation/quarantine, as well as those with other short-term severe medical conditions (i.e. concussions, etc.). This policy should make clear that zooming into class is solely at faculty discretion and that there are many other ways students can complete or make up coursework;
Maintain a strong, continued commitment to an engaged and inclusive digital learning pedagogy as part of a holistic liberal arts education;
DOSA/DOAL should continue to develop orientation and reorientation plans to help students acclimate to residential living and learning.

Employee Engagement

Develop a clear College policy in support of some remote work and more flexible work policies for staff employees;
HR/Senior Staff should plan for a series of re-orientation opportunities for employees and an opportunity for everyone to celebrate the full return to our residential community together.

Campus Spaces

Develop a plan to balance limited programming space and informal social space based on CDC and state guidelines. State capacity requirements at the time of the fall semester will dictate planning, however, we expect many in-person community gatherings, lectures, and events particularly given the vaccine requirement we will be implementing;
Adjust classroom capacities, and policies and guidelines for usage to allow for more in-person intellectual and social opportunities safely. As of right now, our planning includes 3-feet of social distancing between seats in classroom spaces. A committee has completed a review of all classroom spaces to plan for this capacity and department chairs have access to this information. In addition, all current guidance indicates we will continue to wear masks in all indoor spaces on campus in the fall. As we progress throughout the summer, we will continue to be mindful of changing CDC guidance in this area and will adjust accordingly. In-person meetings will be able to occur and will also follow the 3-foot social distancing guidance. Over the summer, we will continue to engage faculty in various disciplines to discuss specific questions related to course formats and implications for specific classroom set-ups and capacities. In addition, if there are ventilation concerns in particular spaces, faculty/staff can contact Plant Operations to learn more about what has been done in those spaces or to seek further guidance.
Re-imagining open space on campus and repurposing it as possible for flexible study, group meeting, and community opportunities using IMLeagues.

Finally, there are some factors that are outside of our control that we will need to continue to monitor. These include ongoing national, regional and local COVID positivity rates, hospitalization rates, etc.; K-12 school status and impact on employeeâs dependent care needs; vaccine availability for employees and students; vaccine effectiveness related to new strains and potential mutations of the virus. Should conditions related to these items change, the College will be prepared to pivot to continue to ensure health and safety is prioritized appropriately.
In closing, much work has been done and there is much still to do. It will require patience, flexibility, and adaptability. We will provide an update to the community once per month at a minimum throughout the summer to share pertinent updates, changes, or new information that should inform your planning for the fall. If there are more significant or immediate changes necessary, we will update you as quickly as possible.
Please direct any specific questions to covid19@muhlenberg.edu. There are multiple individuals monitoring this account and will direct your question to the appropriate person who can respond.
Thank you,

Here in the covid era, Zoom meetings have quickly become the global community center of the New Normal. We go to class, we attend a ceremony, we argue a late fee, we hang out with friends â all from the comfort (and isolation) of our own home. What about the technical glitches, the awkward silences, the frozen faces? Despite the challenges of our new technical realm, we forge bravely on, armed with a wifi router and a yearning to connect.
This sense of longing is where âUnstable Connectionsâ finds its inspiration.
A three-episode webseries, âUnstable Connectionsâ explores the comedy of Zooms gone wrongâ¦ and Zooms gone right, as well. Created for Muhlenberg Collegeâs Mnemonic Theatre Festival, the weekly series premieres April 15.
The showâs co-creators, Muhlenberg theater Professor Beth Schachter and guest artist Gertjan Houben, have set out to create contemporary tragicomedies with a core group of actors, all set in different Zoom meetings.
âWe are hoping to find some comic relief within the meetings,â Schachter says. âWe are all in a serious need of some relief right now, and comedy might do that.â
The fifth instalment in Muhlenbergâs semester-long Mnemonic Theatre Festival, âUnstable Connectionsâ will be available to stream at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow. New episodes premiere Thursdays at 8 p.m. Eastern time. The 13-member company have shared their own experiences in order to devise the content of the show.
The series aims to showcase moments of humor from the stilted constraints of lives lived on Zoom. But the ensemble also hopes to convey their charactersâ determination to continue to forge bonds with each other and to make the most of their lives.
âThe style of these episodes may have broad physical comedy,â Houben says. âBut the characters remain resolutely complex in their humanity.â
Muhlenbergâs mostly-virtual Mnemonic Theatre Festival continues through May. Information on all seven productions in the festival is available at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow
New episodes of âUnstable Connectionsâ premiere Thursdays at 8 p.m. Eastern time, April 15, 22 and 29. Patrons can stream episodes and sign up for reminders at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow.

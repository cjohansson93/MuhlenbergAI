With the goal of enrolling a greater number of high achieving community college students as transfer students, Muhlenberg College has established a Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship program. Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) is the worldâs largest and most prestigious honor society for two-year college students. 
Awarded to top community college students, Muhlenberg will offer an open number of $15,000 annual scholarships, renewable for a maximum of two years, or four semesters. A fifth semester will be reviewed under a case-by-case basis for extraordinary circumstances.
Robert Springall, Muhlenbergâs vice president for enrollment management, describes the new scholarship program as the Collegeâs next step to becoming an even more welcoming destination for transfer students. âOver the past few years, weâve seen an increasing number of community college students interested in transferring into the traditional, full-time undergraduate programs here at Muhlenberg,â he says. âWeâre a place that welcomes talented transfer students and weâre very pleased to offer a substantial PTK Scholarship program.â
Muhlenberg accepts transfer students in both the fall and spring. To be considered for fall transfer admission, students must apply by June 15; for spring, the application deadline is December 10. Financial aid is available for transfer students. 
To be eligible for this scholarship, students must:

Enroll at Muhlenberg as a traditional full-time student.
Be pursuing their first bachelorâs degree.
Be members of PTK Honor Society at the community college where they are enrolled. 
Have a minimum 3.5 GPA upon enrolling at Muhlenberg.
Be in good academic and disciplinary standing at their current institution.

For more information, contact transfer@muhlenberg.edu.
Recruiting talented community college students is important to Muhlenberg. While part-time students and adult learners, age 23 and over, are not eligible for the PTK Scholarship program, the Collegeâs Wescoe School for Continuing Education offers programs especially for these students. For more information about part-time and adult-learner programs, please call 484-664-3300.
In addition, in 2016, the College announced a streamlined admissions process for Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) students interested in furthering their studies at Muhlenberg. The process is designed to ease studentsâ transition from LCCC associate degrees to six Muhlenberg Wescoe School of Continuing Education bachelorâs degree programs with related curriculums.

 Men’s Lacrosse Falls to York


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team suffered its second straight loss to open the season, falling 15-10 at York.

The Mules scored the first two goals of the game and led 3-2 after the first quarter, but York opened the second quarter with three straight goals to go up 5-3. Muhlenberg closed to within a goal on three separate occasions (5-4, 7-6 and 8-7), but each time the Spartans pulled further ahead. 

Senior Jack Reilly scored three goals for his first career hat trick, and senior Doug Rheiner also netted three. Senior Michael Carpetto recorded a career-high three assists.

Senior Ian Jones won 15 of 25 faceoffs, and senior Ian de Ruiter picked up a career-high six ground balls.

The Muhlenberg tennis teams prepared for the rigors of the upcoming Centennial Conference season by playing tough opponents in their first spring matches.

The men lost to Division I Lafayette on Friday night, 7-0, and the women were blanked by 19th-ranked Vassar, 9-0, in a home match on Saturday.

Despite the score, the women had plenty to be encouraged about against a team that made the NCAA Tournament “Sweet 16” last year.

At No. 1 singles, junior Nina Sanders went to three sets against a Vassar player who is a three-time All-American and won the main singles draw
at the ITA Northeast Regional last fall. Sanders (right), who studied abroad in the fall, won the middle set 6-1 in between dropping two close sets, 7-6 (7-5)
and 6-4.

Senior Amanda von Taube also played a three-set match at fifth singles, losing in a supertiebreaker, and sophomore Sharen Resnikoff
lost two close sets at No. 4. In doubles, von Taube and Resnikoff went to a tiebreaker at No. 2, and the No. 3 team of sophomore Jennifer Goldberg
and junior Gabriela Contino played a close 8-6 match.

Of the Mules’ 15 scheduled spring opponents, nine are nationally and/or regionally ranked.

In the men’s match, junior Jason Teitelbaum came the closest to a win, falling in three sets at No. 3 singles. The men are slated to play
six ranked opponents this spring.

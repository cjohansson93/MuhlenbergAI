Patricia Satterlee: Already Gone
Already Gone, 2014 Flashe on linen panel 60 x 60 in.
New works by Patricia Saterlee, January 30 - May 26, 2017, Public Reception February 8, 5 - 6:30pm, Public Artist Talk March 1, 5:00 pm.
Patricia Satterlee's work explores the balance between abstraction and representation, symmetry and irregularity. Her paintings are highly layered compositions, with each layer weaving together observation of physical objects and a sense of the energy within and around the objects. The flashe paint she uses produces a flat matte surface where colors collide between fluidity and solidness. In her drawings and collages, Satterlee focuses more on the tension within the boundaries surrounding physicality and energy fields.
Satterlee's studio is in Brooklyn, New York. She has shown at The Kitchen, Frosch&Portman, Valentine Gallery, M55 Gallery, and Norte Maar in New York; the Matewaan Gallery in Beacon, NY; the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) in Washington, DC; and Salon Zucher in Paris.
Satterlee did undergraduate studies at Carnegie-Mellon University and University of California. She holds an MFA from American University.

Lacrosse Teams Swept by F&M

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team got off to a hot start, but couldn’t keep up the pace in dropping a 16-9 decision to visiting Franklin and Marshall in its Centennial Conference opener.



Women's Lacrosse Falls


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team suffered a 17-6 defeat at the hands of the Diplomats (6-0, 1-0), who came in ranked No. 4 in Division III. 

Junior Stephanie Umbach led the way with four goals and an assist for the Mules (5-2, 0-1), who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Sophomore Arielle Sherman scored her first goal of the season, and junior Kayleigh Thies also found the back of the net.

Sophomore Kiersten Mulvey made a career-high 12 saves between the pipes.

The Mules (1-6, 0-1) jumped out to a 5-1 lead through the first quarter, and took a 6-4 lead on a goal by junior Pat Farrell just over a minute into the second half. But the Diplomats (6-2, 1-0) rattled off nine consecutive goals to put the game out of reach.

Freshman Brad D’Alessandro recorded the first hat trick of his career for Muhlenberg, while sophomore Ryan Bohrod added his first goal and first assist. Bohrod’s milestone tally gave the Mules a 2-1 lead a little over three minutes in, part of a run of five straight goals that had them flying high after the opening period.

Sophomore Steven Casella scored the first of his two goals to get Muhlenberg on the board and jumpstart the spurt. After Bohrod (left) found the back of the net, senior Tom Glancy and junior Jason Mertz sandwiched goals around D’Alessandro’s first to make it 5-1 with a minute to play in the first quarter.

The Diplomats came roaring back with three straight goals to close to within 5-4 at halftime, then pulled away with the backbreaking rally after Farrell opened the third-quarter scoring.

Junior goalie Adam Schlauch equaled a season high by making 15 saves for the second consecutive game. Mertz handed out a pair of assists and scooped up a team-high five ground balls.

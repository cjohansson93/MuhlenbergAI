The production staff of Muhlenberg's Theatre & Dance Department are proud to announce a series of technical theatre workshop sessions for local high school students and K-12 educators. The workshops will be offered on campus, June 15-17, 2021.
These hands-on in-person workshops introduce a variety of tools, techniques, and strategies invaluable to students and teachers interested in expanding their technical theatre skills. All sessions are taught by Muhlenberg's highly accomplished professional production staff.
Sessions will be held Tuesday through Thursday, 1â5 pm. Participants can personalize their workshop experience by selecting three sessions from the list, attending one session per day.
No previous experience or training required! Training is available to high school students who have completed ninth grade, and to all K-12 educators with an interest in theatre.
The total cost for all three workshop sessions for the 2021 Muhlenberg Technical Theatre Training Institute workshops is as follows:
Students: $75 Educators: $100
A limited number of scholarships are available for students and educators. To find out more information, please send an email with your request to Jess Bien at jessicabien@muhlenberg.edu.

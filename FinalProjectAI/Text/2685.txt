men’s lacrosse receives votes in poll



CC Playoff Schedules set


Dates and times for the two Centennial Conference playoff tournaments involving Muhlenberg teams were set.

The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team, in the playoffs for the first time in school history, will play its first-round game at McDaniel on Wednesday, April 23, at 4:00 – a rematch of Saturday’s regular-season final, won by McDaniel, 22-19.

The Mules and Green Terror tied with Ursinus for fourth place in the CC with a 5-4 record. McDaniel received the fourth seed on goal differential, while Muhlenberg got the fifth seed.

Wednesday’s winner travels to Franklin & Marshall to take on the top-seeded defending national champion on Saturday at 1:00. The other semifinal matches Gettysburg against Dickinson at 3:30. The semifinal winners meet Sunday for the conference championship.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team will play a rare Friday morning match in the first round of the playoffs. The Mules will face Swarthmore on Friday, April 25 at 11:00 at Johns Hopkins. The Garnet edged Muhlenberg, 5-4, in the regular-season meeting.

Since Hopkins is hosting both CC tennis tournaments, the women will go Friday and Sunday and the men Saturday and Sunday.

Johns Hopkins will host either Washington or Dickinson in the other semifinal on Friday at 3:00, with the championship match slated for Sunday at 11:00. (corrected 4/22)







Junior John DeLuca leads a Muhlenberg defense that has allowed eight or fewer goals in all but three games.


In just its sixth year as a varsity program, Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse is receiving national attention.

The Mules (8-4) received votes in the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association poll released today. The recognition is another milestone in the young program’s history.

Muhlenberg has set school records for wins and consecutive wins (six) this season, clinching a winning record for the first time and winning a program-best four Centennial Conference games. 

After hosting Moravian on Wednesday, the Mules will travel to Ursinus on Saturday for what amounts to a first-round playoff game: The winner earns a spot in the four-team CC playoffs; the loser ends its season.

Muhlenberg opened the season 2-4, with losses to three teams (Gettysburg, Washington, Haverford) that have been in the USILA top 10 all season. The fourth loss was to Stevens, which was ranked 20th in the preseason poll and is receiving votes this week.

Since then, the Mules have reeled off six straight wins, two against teams (Franklin & Marshall and Montclair State) that are receiving votes in the current poll and two others against teams (Swarthmore and Dickinson) that have received votes this year.

According to the Web site LaxPower.com, Muhlenberg ranks 13th in Division III in ratings percentage index (RPI), which takes into account opponents’ record and opponents’ opponents’ record.

Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies has been providing excellent education to working adults for over 100 years. Through the schoolâs Accelerated Degree Program (ADP), business administration students can efficiently earn a Bachelorâs Degree in a variety of concentrations without sacrificing face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. The ADP utilizes a project-based approach that integrates sound business theory with experiential learning opportunities. In its continuous efforts to combine quality and convenience, The School of Continuing Studies is taking its renowned interactive classroom experience off the Muhlenberg campus directly to studentsâ workplaces. Studies show that approximately 50 to 75 percent of a personâs waking hours are spent at work, traveling to and from work, or engaged in work-related activities. Cognizant of this trend, the School of Continuing Studies is accommodating students by bringing dynamic education to the place where it is most accessible.
The School offers workplace learning opportunities for Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network employees, allowing them to complete the school's accelerated degree program in Business Administration with a concentration in healthcare management onsite at two of the network's hospital locations. Community partnerships with other local businesses have featured non-credit education for the organizations' present and future leaders; the curriculum for these initiatives has been co-created by School of Continuing Studies administration and the company's senior management, ensuring that it is tailored to the development priorities of our partners. Associate Dean Joe Kornfeind is optimistic about expanding similar satellite services to various corporations throughout the Lehigh Valley. "We are pleased to be able to offer local corporations onsite access to our degree programs relevant to their industry as well as specialized training suited to their organizational objectives.  Our partnerships can be designed to incorporate core business principles with material specific to each organization." By combining an onsite classroom with a customized curriculum, School of Continuing Studies is demonstrating the agility necessary to meet the needs of changing academic and corporate environments.
Join the many students who have transformed their lives through lifelong learning. There is a wide variety of opportunities awaiting you or your organization at the School of Continuing Studies. School of Continuing Studies' advisors and faculty look forward to helping you accomplish your goals!

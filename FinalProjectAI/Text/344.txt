Appstream Virtual Lab
Appstream Virtual Lab is the College's virtual software solution. The Appstream Virtual Lab provides students, faculty and staff remote access to campus standard software normally available in physical labs on campus. Since its launch in August 2020, over twenty-five applications have been made available to use. Note: Google Drive IS the storage solution for Appstream. You MUST connect to Google Drive to successfully access, save and store files. Watch the video below to learn how!

 











          Who should use Appstream Virtual Lab?
  









The virtual lab is designed for students to provide access to campus standard software from any location via a web browser. Students will be able to access campus standard software remotely regardless of the operating system or hardware.
Anyone using Apporto Desktop should transition to Appstream Virtual Lab for course instruction.
If you do not have a College owned device, but need access to campus standard software, you may use Appstream to gain access to the software. 

Note: Faculty and staff with a College owned device already have many of these applications locally installed. Appstream is not necessary if you have the desired application already installed on your device.  We encourage faculty to test out the environment to ensure it meets their pedagogical needs and to get a sense of the student experience in the virtual lab.

          Troubleshooting tips
  









I connected my Google Drive storage, but I can't access the files in an application? Try signing out and sign back in to the session to check if your Google Drive storage is available. You will need to wait a few minutes while the expired session closes. If you are still unable to access your Google Drive files, you will want to remove Appstream's access in your Google Account and then login to Appstream to setup your storage again. 
My session is taking a long time to loadAppstream Virtual lab is has a set startup time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds for each session. You will see a countdown clock while the session is being prepared showing REAL TIME exactly how much time is left until the session is available to use. If you recently closed a session, you will need to wait a few minutes before starting a new one. 
I uploaded files to Appstream during my last session and they are no longer thereAppstream's storage solution is Google Drive. While you may upload files for temporary use during a session, they will not be available after that session ends. 
My session timed outAppstream sessions will timeout if you are idle for 60 minutes. This was previously set to 15 minutes idle and has been increased.

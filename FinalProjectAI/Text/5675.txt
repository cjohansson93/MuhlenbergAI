four win events at east stroudsburg




Four members of the Muhlenberg indoor track and field teams finished in first place at the DeSchriver Invitational, hosted by East Stroudsburg.

The men’s team got first-place finishes from juniors David Chorney in the mile, Stuart Udis in the 800 meters and Timothy Van Syckle in the
5,000 meters. All three competed in fields that were dominated by Division II and community college runners. Chorney won by more than two seconds, Udis posted an indoor
personal-best and ECAC-qualifying time, and Van Syckle (left) won by almost 15 seconds, qualified for ECACs and posted the fourth-best 5K time in team history.

Sophomore Alex Faust was the Mules’ other winner, capturing the pole vault and hitting the NCAA provisional mark for the third straight meet.

Three members of the women’s team placed in the top eight in the 800 meters in a field of 46 runners, with freshman Hannah Mitchell coming in third and 
landing in fourth place on the Muhlenberg all-time performance list. Freshman Kim Bier ran the third-fastest 1,000 meters in Mule annals.

The men’s 4x200-meter relay team qualified for ECACs with its time of 1:35.26.

Muhlenberg Disability Advocacy Group (or MDAG) is a group that supports and advocates for students with disabilities on campus, along with providing a safe space to discuss larger social issues of disability awareness. 
All students are welcome to join, regardless of disability status. We are working towards raising awareness of any and all disabilities, alongside making Muhlenberg a more accessible place for all.

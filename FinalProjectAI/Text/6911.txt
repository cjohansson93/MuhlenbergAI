Shannon Pitches, Picks Baseball Team to Another Big Win

Rosen Named Player of the Week




Junior catcher Brett Rosen was named the first Centennial Conference player of the week of the 2013 season.

Rosen opened the season on a roll, hitting .636 with a 1.182 slugging percentage and .750 on-base percentage in the first four games. 
His five extra-base hits (four doubles – including two in one inning vs. Martin Luther – and a triple) are two fewer than he had all of last season. 

Rosen also threw out two of four runners attempting to steal.







When senior Rob Shannon is on top of his game, stepping up to the plate against him is no picnic. And leading off of first base
isn’t much better.




The junior southpaw had every part of his game working against Lebanon Valley, hurling seven spectacular innings as the Muhlenberg baseball team
improved to 4-1 with a 12-2 win in Fort Pierce, Fla.

Shannon tied a career high with nine strikeouts and allowed only five batters to reach base. Of the five, he picked off two. In both of his starts this season,
he has allowed the leadoff batter to reach, then picked him off.

Both of the runs Shannon allowed were unearned due to an error in the third inning. He faced the minimum 12 batters over his final four innings.

Sophomores Austin Cush and Zach Hoffman each pitched a hitless inning to finish off the combined three-hit effort.

The Mule pitchers were backed by an offense that produced 15 hits, including seven doubles (one short of the school record), in reaching double digits
in runs for the second straight day. Muhlenberg scored runs in each of the first five innings and put the game away with a four-run seventh.

Senior Joseph Vila went 3-for-5 with three RBI, doubling in runs in the first and fourth and driving in a run with a single in the seventh.
Junior John Scuderi also had two doubles, one bringing home two runs in the seventh, and junior Nick Kennedy hit
a two-run double in the fifth.

Coming on the heels of yesterday’s 16-2 win against Martin Luther, it’s the first time since 1983 – when they swept a doubleheader from
Gettysburg, 11-1 and 15-2 – that the Mules have allowed two or fewer runs in consecutive games that they won by 10 or more.

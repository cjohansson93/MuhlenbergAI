Cross Country Teams Shine Close to Home

The Muhlenberg men’s cross country team captured the team title at the Mule/Falcon Classic hosted by Cedar Crest at Cedar Beach Park.

The win was all the more impressive because with Dickinson hosting the CC meet on a new course this year and an invitational on that course next weekend, the Mules held out the top 10 on the men’s side in order for them to practice hard and give some younger runners a chance to shine.
 
The brightest of the younger runners was sophomore Thomas McGuire (left) who led the Mules with a second-place finish overall. Three freshmen, Zach Lifman (fifth),Craig Welker (seventh) and Josh Elkan (ninth), finished in the top 10 in their first career races. 

The women only entered three runners, which was not enough for a team score. But the regionally ranked Mules were still impressive, placing two of their three in the top five. 

Senior Kimberlee Yalango (right), running just the second race of her cross country career, came in third, and classmate Melissa Ugelow, who has been battling injuries recently, finished right behind her in fourth.

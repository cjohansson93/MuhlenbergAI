Physical activity helps children cope with stress, prevents disease and provides fun and socialization. In an attempt to integrate fitness into the lives of local youths, Muhlenberg College will support National Women and Girls in Sports Day. On Wednesday, February 9, 2005, many middle and high school girls from the 6th Street Shelter, Caring Place and Casa Guadalupe will come to the College, to participate in various sport-specific clinics hosted by Muhlenberg athletes and coaches.  Following the activities they will enjoy yogurt "sundaes" in the Red Door, located in the lower level of Seegers Student Union.  Established in 1986, National Women and Girls in Sports Day is an annual event rejoicing and honoring the athletic accomplishments of females. Recognized in all 50 states, this year’s theme, “More Than A Game,” acknowledges the significance of women’s participation in sports and the benefits that are a result of sports and physical activity. Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg College is a highly selective, private, liberal arts college in Allentown, Pa.

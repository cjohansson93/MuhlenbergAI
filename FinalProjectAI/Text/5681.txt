men’s basketball completes sweep





Brian Frankoski’s layup with 9:21 left gave Muhlenberg a 56-46 lead.


After leading by 12 points at various stages of the game against Washington, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team weathered a late comeback push to score a 73-69 home victory, the
Mules’ second against the Shoremen this year. 

Junior Mike Bernardini sank six free throws over the last two minutes of the encounter to put the game out of reach.

“I had to stay calm and keep my focus because I knew these were big free throws for my team,” Bernardini said. 

Sophomore Ryan Foster converted five of his six field goal attempts in the first half, scoring 13 points to propel the Mules to a comfortable 37-25 halftime lead.

Muhlenberg stayed cold in the first three minutes of the second half before Peter Barnes fired up the stands with a brutal dunk, connecting on a pass by Bernardini, 
and made the score 39-30 in favor of the Mules.

The home lead reached 12 points for third time in the game when Foster drilled his third three-pointer on the night with 10:08 remaining. 
From that moment on, the Shoremen started reducing slowly the deficit.

At the three-minute mark, Washington made one of two free throws, making the score 63-60 Muhlenberg.

“We knew that they had forced a couple of overtimes in their previous games and would never give up,” said Bernardini.

However, the Mules were looking forward to their third straight home victory and showed stable nerves in the waning seconds.

A pair of Obi Nwizugbo free throws and a successful three-point play by Bernardini made the score 68-60.

Bernardini went 5-for-6 during the last minute of play to lead Muhlenberg to its sixth Centennial Conference win.  

Foster finished with eight rebounds and a team-leading 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting, while Bernardini added 16 and five rebounds. 
Nwizugbo tallied his second career double-double with a game-high 13 rebounds and 10 points. Chris MacIntosh dished out five assists and contributed eight points, and
Barnes netted a career-high 10 points.

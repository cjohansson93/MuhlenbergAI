Erik Snyder’s second-quarter touchdown gave the Mules a 17-7 lead in their season-opening 34-21 victory against Wilkes.


The Muhlenberg football team may have been idle last weekend, but the Mules were on the move in the D3football.com national poll.

The Mules moved up from No. 8 to No. 6 following losses 
by two of the teams that had been ranked ahead of them, Wesley and Bethel. The ranking is the highest in the
Division III poll in program history.

Muhlenberg will put its ranking, and 12-game regular-season winning streak, to the test on Saturday when it travels to Schenectady, N.Y., to take on Union, a 24-14 winner
at Springfield in its 2008 opener.

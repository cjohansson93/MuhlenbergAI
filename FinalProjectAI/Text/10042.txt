Learning GoalsUpon completion of their course of study, Italian Studies students demonstrate:

Proficiency in Italian across the four language skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking), as well as a high level of cultural competency.
The critical skills necessary to read, analyze and interpret a variety of texts (literary, visual, historical) through writing, discussion and other forms of analytical and creative expression.
A nuanced understanding of the cultural and religious diversity of Italian society, and of Italyâs roles in the contemporary world.
An understanding of Italian history from the medieval period to the present day, and the complexity of the cultural, economic, religious and political currents that have shaped the lives of Italians.
Familiarity with canonical and non-canonical works of Italian literature and art and with the cultural and historical contexts that gave rise to them.
An understanding of Italian contributions to diverse realms of intellectual and artistic endeavor, which have had global influence, including theatre, film, literature, art, science and political thought.

 
Program StructureIntermediate Italian I & II  (or the equivalent taken at another institution, upon approval) are required for the minor. Students with prior knowledge of Italian can place out of Intermediate Italian I and/or II, in which case they would be exempted from taking them. Students placing out of Intermediate Italian I would begin their study at Intermediate Italian II and complete the minor with four electives. Students placing out of Intermediate Italian II would be exempted from the Intermediate Italian requirement, and complete the minor with five elective courses.
Of the 4 courses in addition to Intermediate Italian I & II, students may choose from a list of pre-approved electives or request approval for a course from the program director. The list of pre-approved courses is growing every semester, so please contact the program director for an updated list of electives. Some courses on the list have pre-requisites, so students are asked to read course descriptions carefully. As of spring 2017, the courses on offer include:

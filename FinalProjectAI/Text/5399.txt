football team gets rematch with wesley


The Muhlenberg football team drew a familiar opponent for the first round of the NCAA Division III Championships: Wesley, the team that knocked the Mules out of the NCAAs last year.

Muhlenberg will host Wesley on Saturday, November 22, at 12 noon, in one of 16 first-round games. The winner will travel to 


Chorney Added to Cross Country Field



Senior David Chorney of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team received an invitation to the NCAA Division III Championships after all. Chorney was “on the bubble” after finishing 20th at yesterday’s Mideast Regional, but made the field when the Haverford team received an at-large bid.

Chorney joins classmate Timothy Van Syckle to give the Mules two individual qualifiers for the third time in the last seven years. The same pair qualified last year and were part of the Muhlenberg team that ran in the national meet in 2006. 

The NCAA Championships are slated for Saturday, November 22, at Hanover College.

Texas to take on the winner of Hardin-Simmons at Mary Hardin-Baylor.

field in Dover, Del. The Mules led 7-0 for most of the first half, but the Wolverines tied the score just before halftime and pulled away in the second half to win, 38-21.

Muhlenberg (9-1) and Wesley (8-1) have similar resumes: Both won their conference championships, and for both the only loss came on the road by three points on a late touchdown – Muhlenberg to Moravian (27-24) and Wesley to Delaware Valley (25-22).

The difference is that the Mules’ loss came in the last game of the regular season, while the Wolverines’ came in the first game. Since then Wesley has won eight straight by an average margin of 29.5 points.

Muhlenberg is making its fifth NCAA appearance and is one of only 10 Division III schools to earn a bid to the NCAAs in five of the last seven years. The Mules are 2-4, having advanced to the second round in 2002 and last year, and are 2-0 when playing their first game at home.

Wesley is in the NCAA Tournament for the fifth time also. The Wolverines have an 8-4 record, including trips to the national semifinals in both 2005 and 2006, and have eliminated the Centennial Conference champion the last two years (Dickinson in 2006, Muhlenberg in 2007).

In the poll before Saturday’s games, Muhlenberg was ranked fourth and Wesley 12th by the American Football Coaches Association. In the new D3football.com poll,
the Wolverines are seventh and the Mules 14th.

George Psomas  Class of 2005 Dual Major in Business and Theatre
Broadway, film and television actor, print model, voiceover artist, development staff for Roundabout Theatre





After graduation I decided to take the plunge and move to New York City and pursue a career as an actor. I spent my first summer here “pounding the pavement,” and booked my first job in the ArtsPower National Tour of The Rainbow Fish; it was a start, and it allowed me to join the Actor’s Equity Union. In September of 2007 I won the title of “Broadway Idol” with the New York Music Theatre Festival, and shortly after that, I was given a big break; I was cast in the original revival cast of South Pacific on Broadway, including the Live from Lincoln Center PBS broadcast.
 
 
In the Theatre & Dance Department, I was being taught not only by scholars, but by gifted artists as well. A number of those professors helped me to mold my creative mind and to find my voice as an actor. I was urged to push boundaries and explore the unknown, to trust myself, and above all, to listen. I would have to say that going to Muhlenberg was the best decision that I ever made. It afforded me opportunities that I would never have gotten otherwise. I felt like I was constantly challenged, and I am not ashamed to say that I faced those challenges head-on and succeeded. If I had to do it all again, I would. www.GeorgePsomas.com

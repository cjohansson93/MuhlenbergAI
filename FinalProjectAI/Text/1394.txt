A Message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg Community


	 Wednesday, January 19, 2022  07:39 PM

To The Muhlenberg Community,
On Saturday, we watched as an antisemitic hostage situation unfolded at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas. Thankfully the four hostages escaped but the most recent attack is horrific and leaves members of the Jewish community across the country and on our campus shaken by yet another case of hate and violence. As hate crimes in general continue to increase, we remain concerned about the increase in assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews, which remains at near-historic levels in the U.S. at this time.
We condemn all forms of antisemitism and violence. Muhlenberg takes pride in providing a safe, welcoming and supportive campus for all members of our community. We stand in solidarity with the Jewish members of our community as we lift up and offer strength to members of Beth Israel Synagogue, the Colleyville community, and our local and Muhlenberg Jewish community.
At moments like this, we must rely on the strength of our community to comfort and hold space for one another. Because we are a College that strongly believes in caring for one anotherânot just in times of troubling incidents, but alwaysâwe know that we have the resilience to move forward and find ways to remain vigilant in keeping our community safe. We stand alongside the Jewish community to confront all forms of extremism that result in violence.
Incidents like these can increase stress and anxiety significantly. Please know that Muhlenberg is here for you. The Counseling Center and College Chaplains, including Director of the Leffell Center for Jewish Life Ira Blum, are available for confidential support and conversation whether you need help in coping with this latest act of bigotry and violence or just want a reaffirming sense of community. In addition, the Office of Multicultural Life, the Bias Resource & Education Team and the Associate Provost for Faculty and Diversity Initiatives are helpful community resources you can access. Employees may turn to the Employee Assistance Program as well. Finally, reports of bias incidents at the College that could violate College policies may also be made to Equity & Title IX, or online.
I encourage you to reach out if you need help.
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringPresident

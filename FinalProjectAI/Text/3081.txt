Boyle, mckeon earn first-team cc honors


For the third consecutive year, senior guard Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was selected to the All-Centennial Conference first team. Along with Boyle, sophomore guard Kelly McKeon was selected to the All-CC first team for the first time.

Two other Mules received conference honors. 

Freshman guard Alexandra Chili was selected to the All-CC second team, and senior center Erin McSherry earned honorable mention. In addition, Ron Rohn was named the CC’s first coach of the year in women’s basketball.

The first Muhlenberg player and eighth in Conference history to earn first-team All-Centennial honors three times, Boyle (left) ranks in the top 10 of the CC in scoring (ninth at 13.9 points per game) and free-throw percentage (fifth at .819). She leads the Mules in three-point field goal percentage and is second in points, third in steals and seventh in rebounding.

Boyle has scored in double figures in 19 of 25 games, with two outings of 20 points or more. She has led 

the team in scoring 10 times and rebounding once. On the program’s career list, she is third in scoring (1,431 points), tied for second in field goals (575) and fifth in free throws (242) and assists (271). 

McKeon (right), who received honorable mention last year, has been CC player of the week twice this season and in consecutive weeks. She leads the CC and ranks 10th in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.42). She also ranks in the top 10 of the CC in assists (second at 4.84 per game) and rebounding (8.1 rebounds per game). 

McKeon leads the Mules in assists and rebounds and is third in scoring (11.4 points per game). She recorded only the second triple-double in school history with 13 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists vs. Ursinus in Saturday’s regular-season finale. In less than two full seasons, she already is sixth on the program’s all-time assists list (225).

As a member of the All-CC second team, Chili leads the CC and ranks second in Division III in three-point field goals made. She is in the top 10 of the CC in scoring (tied for second at 16.5 points per game) and assists (3.84 per game). 

Chili, who leads the Mules in scoring and is fifth in rebounding, is just the fourth freshman to earn first- or second-team All-Centennial honors.

McSherry made the all-conference squad for the second time. She is averaging 7.0 points per game and 6.3 rebounds per game and is third in the CC with 42 blocked shots. With 153 career blocked shots, she is first on the program’s all-time list and fifth in CC history. 

This is the first time in school history that four Mules have earned All-CC honors. The all-star group led the team to first place in the Centennial Conference with an 18-0 conference record. Muhlenberg also ranks No. 19 nationally in the D3hoops.com poll and No. 15 in the WBCA rankings. Muhlenberg hosts the CC playoffs this weekend beginning with a semifinal matchup on Saturday.

Teaching Interests
I am a visiting assistant professor of sociology at Muhlenberg College and teach a variety of courses including the sociology of inequality and power, American ethnic diversity, transnational migrant communities, global perspectives on race and racism as well as sociological theory. I am also a faculty mentor for a number of students working on their undergraduate research projects. During the 2016-2017 academic year, I taught the 2017 senior sociology seminar (CUE) course mentoring the departmentâs seniors in their independent research projects. Learn more about the final projects for the 2017 CUE here. 
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research is organized around several interrelated projects and themesâmigration and geopolitics, as well as racialized and politicized belongingâwhich are examined through a cross-national, qualitative methods approach with a regional specialization in contemporary Europe and the United States.  In my most recent work, I consider how the rise of anti-immigrant movements across Europe, the 2015 Refugee Crisis and the 2016 Iran Deal are reflected in the perceptions and experiences of belonging and membership of Iranians in the United States and Germany.

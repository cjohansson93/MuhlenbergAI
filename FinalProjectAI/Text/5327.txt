men’s basketball wins another close one





Nwizugbo’s second three-pointer gave the Mules a 53-43 lead with just under eight minutes to play.



It doesn’t matter who or where the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team plays these days – the games always seem to come down to the wire.

The Mules (8-6, 4-4) held off a late rally to pick up their first road win of the season, 66-62 at Dickinson. Muhlenberg’s last five games have been decided by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 points, and the seven-point game was tied with three minutes left.

Ahead by four points at halftime, the Mules scored the first eight points of the second half to open up a 12-point lead. The advantage grew to as many as 14 points six minutes into the half before the Red Devils (7-6, 2-6) began their comeback.

Muhlenberg still led by 10 (53-43) with five minutes to play. Dickinson cut the margin in half by scoring the next five points. Five times in the last 2:30, the Red Devils closed to within two, but they never had possession with a chance to tie or take the lead. The Mules went 11-of-14 from the line to close out the game.

Sophomore Evan Tozer sank all eight of his free-throw attempts down the stretch, including six in the last 31 seconds. Junior Ryan Foster also hit a pair of clutch foul shots.

Muhlenberg got a big boost from two post players off the bench when its starting posts got into foul trouble. Junior Obi Nwizugbo scored a team-high 13 points, and senior Tim Murray a season-high 24 minutes, scoring five points, pulling down two rebounds and blocking a shot.

Tozer and freshman Spencer Liddic scored 11 points apiece.

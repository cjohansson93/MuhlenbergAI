The Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) conducts scientific-based research related to public opinion at the local, state and national levels. Since its founding in 2001, the MCIPO has focused its attention on measuring the publicâs views on electoral and public policy issues with a concentration on environmental and health matters. MCIPO consistently earns top ratings from FiveThirtyEight's Pollster Ratings, based on the historical accuracy and methodology of each polling organization's polls.

As a student you may encounter circumstances where it is necessary or advisable to temporarily take a step back from your studies due to medical necessity or in order to attend to family needs, work, travel, or gain a fresh perspective on your intellectual commitments, career plans, or educational priorities. The College encourages students to carefully consider their situations, to clarify their objectives, consult with college advisors, and to evaluate whether they should temporarily interrupt their studies. Listed below are the temporary absence policies to consider.
Medical issues, both physical and mental, encountered by students, may require that they remain away from the College for more than a short term absence of two weeks.
Medical Leave of Absence Policy

Students may encounter circumstances where it is advisable to temporarily take a step back from their studies in order to attend to family needs, work, travel, or gain a fresh perspective on their intellectual commitments, career plans, or educational priorities.
Personal Leave of Absence Policy

Eligible students with an extraordinary reason, may be able to continue their academic study at Muhlenberg College via remote instruction if unable to attend and participate in in-person instruction for the semester at the College.
Request for Remote Learning Policy

During the academic semester, a student may be unable to physically attend courses for a short duration of time. This policy provides an opportunity for students to maintain enrollment with the expectation that a student will return to complete the course in person until course completion.

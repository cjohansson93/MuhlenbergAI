About Me: I graduated from Muhlenberg in the Class of 2021, and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Organizational Leadership in the Graduate Studies program. I am also a proud Parsippany Hills alum and the oldest of 7 kids! In my free time, I love spending time with my family and pets, but if I'm not with them you can find me at a football game, travelling, reading, or getting crafty.
Advice for Prospective Students: I believe it is important to get started early to truly evaluate your wants and needs for your college experience and career pursuits. It's important to introduce yourself to an admissions counselor and to ask about opportunities to connect with students and faculty to see if you can picture yourself on campus. And don't be afraid to ask questions!
Favorite Food on Campus? My favorite food on campus is the chicken shawarma from the Noshery in the Wood Dining Commons!

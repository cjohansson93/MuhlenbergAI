Students for Queer Advocacy (SQuAD) supports LGBTQIAP+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual/aromantic, pansexual, etc.) students on Muhlenberg's campus. We are an advocacy group focused on creating a safe space both inside and outside of our meetings.
We meet on a weekly basis to discuss relevant topics and host events throughout the year. SQuAD is a safe space to support and learn from one another.
During Spring '22, we will be meeting on Sundays at the Multicultural Center from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Current & prospective students interested in LGBTQIAP+ life at Muhlenberg are welcome to join our Facebook group or email us at rainbowmule@gmail.com.

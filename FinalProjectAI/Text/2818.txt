 Wrestling championship preview


mckeon named co-player of year


We have a winner! Actually, we have two of them.

Muhlenberg junior Kelly McKeon was voted women’s co-player of the year by coaches, sports information directors and media members in attendance at the final Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball luncheon of the 2009-10 season at Starter’s Pub in Bethlehem.

McKeon shared the honor with Kate Harrison of Moravian, another player whose statistics might not have matched up with the other nominees on the ballot, but whose play has helped her team to a very successful season.

On the men’s side, Mule sophomore Spencer Liddic was named 



to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Team of the Year.

“Kelly is the type of player who, as a coach, you say I can’t believe I only have her one more year, and as an opponent, you say I can’t believe I have to play against her one more year,” said Muhlenberg head coach Ron Rohn.

McKeon leads the 19-4 Mules in assists (101), steals (53) and free throws (85) and is second in scoring (13.4 points per game), all of which are to be expected of a 5-6 point guard. She also leads the team in rebounding (7.6 per game) for the second straight year, which is not.

McKeon is the only player in the top 10 in the Centennial Conference in scoring, rebounding and assists. She also ranks in the top 10 in steals and leads the league in assist-to-turnover ratio, a category in which she ranked 11th in Division III at the start of the week.

But the most important number is 63, the number of wins for Muhlenberg in McKeon’s 75 career starts at point guard.

“She’ll make any play that you need to win the game, and she refuses to be defeated,” said Rohn. “She is probably 



the most intense competitor come game time of any athlete in any sport that I’ve seen.”

McKeon is closing in on two career milestones, one of which she could get this year and the other likely for next 2010-11. She is 33 points away from 1,000 and needs 71 assists to become the program’s all-time leader.

Liddic, who also represented Muhlenberg at the Scholar-Athlete luncheon in January, has taken off since leading scorer and rebounder Peter Barnes suffered a career-ending injury at Gettysburg.

“I learned very quickly when I took the job in May that I had the best post player in the conference,” said first-year Mule head coach Scott McClary. “And when he got hurt, I still had the best post player in the conference.”

Liddic leads the CC in rebounding by a wide margin at 10.5 per game, and he also is eighth in scoring at 14.7 points per game. Since Barnes went down, Liddic’s averages are staggering – 17.0 points and 12.5 rebounds per game.

“He’s made getting double-doubles a habit,” said McClary. “He’s grown and turned into an absolute leader, and that exceeds all the numbers.”

Liddic is poised to become only the second Muhlenberg sophomore in the last 38 years to average a double-double for a season.

“The best thing I can say about him is that he’s a sophomore and we’ll have him for two more years. He’s the foundation that our program is going to be built on,” added McClary.

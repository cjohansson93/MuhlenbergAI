“Muhlenberg College has always been vigilant about its finances,” said Kent Dyer, the College’s Chief Business Officer.  “We are pleased to receive this recognition from a highly respected third party.” 
According to Moody’s, the A1rating is based on the agency’s expectation of manageable debt levels, an excellent senior management team, continued strong operating performance leading to comfortable debt service coverage, and stable enrollment in the context of strengthening student demand. 
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg College is a private, highly selective, liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America

Megan Lyttle




Hello! My name is Megan Lyttle (she/her), and Iâm a member of the class of 2023. I'm also one of the co-presidents of the MHPA! Iâm a neuroscience major and studio art minor, I do research in the lab of Dr. Wilson, and I work as a peer tutor. If you ever need to find me, I'm probably on the third floor of New Sci furiously folding paper cranes- if youâve seen the cranes in New Sci and Trumbower- thatâs me :) - or eating muffins. I'm a proud Hufflepuff, I'm obsessed with otters, and I like to spend my time reading, painting, playing the drums and the oboe, watching anything Marvel, and eating snacks.
If you ever want to talk, or if youâd like a worm on a string, feel free to contact me through my email at mlyttle@muhlenberg.edu or via text at 732-540-2711

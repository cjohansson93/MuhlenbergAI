Following a national search, Muhlenberg has named JosÃ© DieudonnÃ© as the College's chief information officer. DieudonnÃ© currently serves as the associate vice president for technology and library services at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Prior to his work at Wilson, he served as vice president for technology and chief information officer at Point University in West Point, Georgia, and as vice president of library and information technology and chief information officer at Arcadia University in Glenside, Pennsylvania.
"I am excited to welcome JosÃ© DieudonnÃ© to Muhlenberg as our new chief information officer," says Kathleen Harring, president of Muhlenberg College. "He brings to Muhlenberg broad technology and leadership experience and an appreciation for the values of a liberal arts education. I look forward to the contributions he will make to advance the Collegeâs strategic priorities."
During his time at Wilson, DieudonnÃ© was responsible for the development and implementation of the college's information technology strategic plan and provided leadership on a number of key initiatives, including the adoption of a learning management system and development of distance education programs. He also served a key role in Pointâs transition to several new technology platforms, including an enterprise resource planning system and advancement and payment processing software.
DieudonnÃ© earned a bachelor's degree in computer science, a master's of educational leadership and a master's of business administration from Arcadia University.
"I am humbled and honored to join the Muhlenberg community. The Collegeâs mission and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, its distinctive and engaging academic experience and the talented and engaged people drew me to the College," said DieudonnÃ© in a statement. "I look forward to collaborating with administrators, faculty, staff and students as we support and enhance the student learning experience."
DieudonnÃ© will succeed interim chief information officer Timothy Foley, who joined Muhlenberg in August of 2019.

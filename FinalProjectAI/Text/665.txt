Our Curriculum

The Political Science Program advances Muhlenberg Collegeâs mission as a liberal arts institution to cultivate thoughtful, articulate, active and responsible citizens. We recognize the value of diversity to building inclusive communities.  By developing studentsâ knowledge of political scienceâits theories, concepts, and research methodsâour courses enable students to explore how power relationships, institutional arrangements, social-economic inequalities, identities, and ideological commitments shape and are shaped by public policy, political action, and public argument in a diverse and globally interdependent society.
All students majoring in Political Science complete 5 required core courses, including Introduction to American National Government (PSC 101); Introduction to Comparative Politics & International Relations (PSC 103); Political Ideologies (PSC 201); Political Science Research Methods (PSC 301); and the Political Science Senior Capstone Seminar, or Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CUE) (PSC 490). 
In addition, students select five upper-level classes (at least two of which are at the 300 level or above) from thematic areas:

Policy Studies
States, Conflict and Culture
Problems in Democracy
Institutions & Processes
(In)Equality, Justice and Power
Citizenship & Political Engagement

After careful and close advising with a faculty advisor, students select three courses from one thematic area and at least one course from two other thematic areas.
Our curriculum imparts to our students the values and commitments, knowledge, and skills that are required for engaged, informed, democratic engagement and leadership in an increasingly globalized world.

Field hockey explodes vs. Moravian


There was something sweet about the Muhlenberg field hockey team’s 5-0 win against Moravian.

True, it snapped a three-game losing streak in which the Mules scored just two goals. It did avenge a 2-1 loss to the Greyhounds last year. And, combined with the women’s tennis victory earlier in the day, it also gave Muhlenberg an early 3-0 lead in the Matte Award standings for 2008-09.

But there was more to it than that.

find the back of the net, she asked head coach Megan Eddinger if she could have a candy bar if she scored a goal. After she got her goal and candy bar against Montclair State, other players began asking for the same enticement.

Tara Cohn came out of the Moravian game feeling as if she had just been out trick-or-treating for Halloween. The junior scored three goals for her first career hat trick – in fact, she entered the game with only two goals in her career.

Women’s Tennis Also Beats Moravian



Despite competing without its No. 1 singles player, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team defeated Moravian, 7-2, in its first dual match of the fall.

The Mules, with their lineup juggled, swept the doubles and won four of six singles matches. Sophomore Lindsay Schmidt posted the most decisive singles victory, 6-0, 6-1 at No. 5, while sophomore Caitie Druker prevailed 12-10 in a third-set supertiebreaker to capture No. 1 singles.

is new territory for me,” said Cohn, who played midfield previously. 

Cohn scored the first, third and fifth goals and also assisted on the second. The hat trick, the first by a Mule since Adrienne Verbich scored three in a 2004 game, was completed 1:42 into the second half with a shot off a penalty corner. Junior Kristen Sabia, whose first-half goal gave Muhlenberg (2-5) a 4-0 lead, was waiting at the post and could have tipped the ball in, but let it go through.

“I just followed it in with my stick when I knew it was going in,” said Sabia. “I didn’t want to take [the goal] from Tara.”

That type of unselfish teamwork was apparent all night as the Mules righted themselves after dropping their Centennial Conference opener to Washington on Saturday.

“We’re figuring things out,” commented Cohn. “We connected tonight, and we used the small ball. We just have to play as a team.”

The whole team clicked against the Greyhounds (2-5), who had taken four of their first six games to overtime. After winning a penalty corner early on, Moravian barely crossed midfield with possession until late in the game. Muhlenberg had an 18-2 advantage in shots and scored three of its goals on penalty corners.

Senior Julie deLaurentis gave the Mules a 2-0 lead with a blast off a corner, her second goal in as many games. Freshman Shelby Smith assisted on the last goal for her first career point.

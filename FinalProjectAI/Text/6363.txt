Baseball Blanked by Susquehanna
 Friday, March 16, 2012 - page 3







					 



For the first time this season, the Muhlenberg baseball team could not get anything going on offense. The Mules were held to a season-low four hits as they were shut out for the first time this year, 9-0 at Susquehanna.

Muhlenberg (10-4) did not have a baserunner until sophomore Nick Kennedy was hit by a pitch in the top of the fifth. It was the seventh time Kennedy (left) has been hit by a pitch this season, which is the most by a Mule in a season in four years.

Two batters later, freshman Nick Plinio singled through the right side for Muhlenberg’s first hit.

Senior Nick Busillo and sophomore John Scuderi each had singles, and sophomore Andy Doolittle picked up the first hit of his career with a double in the ninth.

Football Moves Into Top 20


The Muhlenberg football team moved up to No. 20 in the D3football.com poll
after its 31-0 shutout of Franklin & Marshall.

The Mules (7-0) are one of 16 remaining undefeated teams in Division III.
They will put their winning streak on the line Saturday with a Family
Weekend home game against defending Centennial Conference champion
Dickinson, which received five votes in the poll.

Muhlenberg was in the top 20 in a national Division III poll only once
before – in 2002, when it was ranked 17th by Football Gazette after
winning in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

complete poll.


Sophomore Samuel Hayden of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer
team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Hayden, a center back, anchored a defense that helped the Mules to a 2-1
win vs. No. 7 New Jersey, then scored his first career goal to cap the
scoring in a 3-0 CC victory at Haverford. The shutout was Muhlenberg’s
eighth in 13 games this sesason and extended its CC scoreless string to
311 minutes.

Hayden has started every game this year for the Mules, who are 10-3
overall and 5-2 in the Centennial Conference. They have a five-game
winning streak and are tied for second in the CC with two games left in
the regular season.

Women's Tennis Finishes Season with Loss at TCNJ
 Sunday, April 22, 2012







					 


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team wrapped up its season with an 8-1 loss at No. 23 New Jersey.

The lone win for the Mules came at No. 3 singles, where freshman Jennifer Goldberg took the first set in a tiebreaker and had a 3-1 lead in the
second when her opponent retired.

The victory capped an impressive rookie campaign for Goldberg. She led the team in wins with a 22-17 record, including a 15-4 mark in singles. With her team-best
10-4 singles record in spring dual matches, she was the first Muhlenberg freshman to reach double digits since 2008.

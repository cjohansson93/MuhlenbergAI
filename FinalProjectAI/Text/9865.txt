Alumni Update
Jeremy Arnold '12 â Dance and Media & Communication
Jeremy Arnold has completed his Master of Fine Arts degree in Dance and Social Justice at the University of Texas. At âBerg, Jeremy was a tap virtuoso and cum laude graduate. Here's what he's been up to since his âBerg days.
I moved to Austin in 2014 to accept a position with Tapestry Dance Company, directed by Acia Gray, where I was a principal dancer for three seasons.
In my second year in Austin I began to work as a lecturer in the Dance Department at the University of Texas, teaching courses in Rhythm Tap, Jazz, Projects in Dance Performance and Repertoire, and Music Theory. I held that position for three years, until I decided to get my MFA. I have lso continued to work for (former Muhlenberg Dance faculty member) Charles O. Andersonâs dance theatre X.
In addition to teaching at UT, I teach on the weekends with Revive Dance Convention and nationally at various Tap Festivals, including Riff Dallas Tap Festival, Soul 2 Sole festival, True Sound Rhythm Festival, Phoenix Tap Festival, and Little Rock Tap Festival. My choreography has been presented at University of Texas, Kennesaw State University, and McLennon College.
I was accepted to University of Texasâs new MFA in Dance and Social Justice program in 2018. Having just defended my thesis âRhythms Worth Shedding,â I will be graduating with Highest Honors on May 23.
Check out Jeremy's amazing Thesis Concert!

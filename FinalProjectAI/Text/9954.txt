Patricia Koch Budlong 
Voice, SopranoBackground
Patricia Budlong holds a Performance Certificate in Opera and a Master of Music in Vocal Performance from DePaul University in Chicago, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Music Education from West Chester University. In 1994 Patricia won a position in the Lyric Opera of Chicago chorus. During her five seasons at the Lyric, Patricia had the opportunity to work with world renowned singers, conductors, stage directors and coaches. During this same period she made her professional operatic debut at the Pine Mountain Music Festival in Michigan as the title character in Carlisle Floydâs dramatic opera, Susannah. Other operatic roles with which she is identified include MicaÃ«la (Carmen) by Bizet, Musetta (La BohÃ¨me) by Puccini, Alice (Falstaff) by Verdi, the title role in Massenetâs Manon, Violetta (La Traviata) by Verdi, and Elle (La Voix Humaine) by Poulenc. Her concert repertoire includes such works as the soprano solo in Mahlerâs Symphony No. 4, Straussâs Vier Letze Lieder, Barberâs Knoxville: Summer of 1914; soprano soloist in Hadynâs Die SchÃ¶pfung and Mendelssohnâs Elijah. She is also an active chamber musician performing with Take 3 Woodwind Trio and the Alberta Percussion Ensemble in Edmonton Canada as well as Two-Part Invention and Satori in the Lehigh Valley. In addition to her performing career, Patricia has maintained an active teaching career. Previous college teaching experience includes many years at Moravian College where she also directed the Opera Workshop and has been awarded the T. Edgar Shields Prize for excellence in studio teaching.   Her pedagogical focus is on engaging her students in using their entire instrument in healthful singing, while developing excellent musicianship and a diverse repertoire.

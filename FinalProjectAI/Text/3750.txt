Volleyball ends skid





Jenn Seeba finished with four kills and three blocks against the Scarlet Raptors.


Davi Gordon admits she is a very emotional player.

So when the Muhlenberg volleyball team raced out to a quick win in the first set against Rutgers-Camden, the junior outside hitter said she could feel the positive vibes flowing from her teammates.

While the Mules would go on to drop the second set, they rallied to claim the final two, to beat the Scarlet Raptors in four sets, 25-17, 20-25, 25-19, 25-23.

"I just felt like we were passing well and communicating well," Gordon said. "The energy was good and I just fed off the good energy. I was just trying to help everyone out and put the ball away."

Gordon finished with nine kills in the match, tied for the team-high with Jackie Price. Price also added seven blocks, while Gordon picked up four.

Gordon said the win against Rutgers-Camden (6-9), which came in the seventh place match of the Spartan Invitational, was especially sweet because it was a positive finish to the tournament and made the bus ride home from York a little more enjoyable. 

"We had a rough start to the weekend, and we were just ready to get that win," Gordon said. "We just went out on the floor and left everything out there and came out successful.

"It feels really good because we've been so close so many times, but have just not been able to finish the job. So hopefully this win will start something in our team and we'll keep rolling with the momentum."

Morgan Duggan dished out 20 assists and added seven digs for the Mules (2-12), while Erica Wenzel finished with three aces against the Scarlet Raptors.

The win was Muhlenberg's first since defeating Gordon at the season-opening Gordon Invitational. And Gordon said she hopes Saturday's performance and positive feeling will stick with the Mules going forward. 

"We just have to keep doing the same things that made us successful," Gordon said. "We have to keep talking, keep working hard and just be excited to play volleyball."

Muhlenberg dropped its opener on Saturday to St. Mary's (Md.), 3-0. Gordon led the Mules with six kills and five digs in that match.

Reason for Using Emergency Phones What is Supsicious Activity? Locations of Emergency Phones Reason for Using Campus PHones Location of Campus Phones
Muhlenberg College has installed several emergency and campus phones in and around the campus. Also, located in some of the academic buildings around campus are a few “courtesy phones” for use to call on campus. Emergency Phones will give you direct contact with the Campus Safety Office. The phones are bright yellow with a blue colored light above them and have an “emergency button” or “help” that will dial Campus Safety when it is pushed.
To use the emergency phone press in the red button and it will automatically dial the Campus Safety dispatcher.
REASON FOR USING EMERGENCY PHONES

        - EMERGENCY
        - SUSPICIOUS PERSONS
        - ESCORT
        - VANDALISM
        - CRIMINAL ACTS

WHAT IS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY?
Suspicious activity is anything even slightly out of the ordinary for the area or time of day in which it occurs. Some of the most obvious things to watch for and report are:

      - Stranger’s entering your neighbor’s room.
      - Strangers trying doors to see if they are locked.
      - The sound of breaking glass or other loud noises.
      - Persons carrying bolt cutters and tools – especially near bicycles.
      - Persons running – especially if carrying something valuable. (They could be leaving the scene of a crime).
      - People wearing bulky clothing or attire not consistent with the weather conditions, for example, heavy clothing or coats on a hot day.

In addition to the emergency ophones, Muhlenberg College has installed some emergency phones with key pads. These phone allow individuals to dial a direct contact with the residents of the building by pressing the black “call” button and dialing the desired campus extension. Press the red button, marked “emergency” and/or “help” and you will have contact with the Campus Police Office. These phones are near some of the entrance doors to the residence halls and/or mile houses. The map on the following page will provide you with information concerning the locations of the emergency and campus phones around campus.

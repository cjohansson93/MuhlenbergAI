Lacrosse, tennis fall at Washington


Trailing by three at the break, the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team scored three of the first four goals of the second half to pull to within one of Washington.

But the Shorewomen (8-2, 2-2) responded with four in a row, and six of the next seven, to pull away and hold off a late Mule charge for a 16-13 win in Chestertown.

Senior Danielle Rosen scored five goals and added three assists to give her 185 points in her career, good for fourth in Muhlenberg history.



Sophomore Alex Bellini (left) set new career highs with four goals and five points for the Mules (4-5, 0-4).

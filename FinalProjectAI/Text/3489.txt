bullpen nails down baseball sweep




Senior Adam Scarzafava and sophomore Tim Velys earned saves as the Muhlenberg baseball team opened its 2011 season with a doubleheader sweep of Gallaudet.

Scarzafava (left) got the final out in a 4-1 win in the opener, and Velys (right) pitched 



a scoreless seventh to preserve a 4-3 victory in the nightcap.

The Mules received outstanding pitching from the six hurlers who combined to pitch the first game. Senior Jason 




Daniels tossed the first three innings and struck out five, and sophomores Billy Rogers and Ryan Rechten each fanned two in a one-inning stint.

Muhlenberg jumped on top in its first inning of the season when junior Jesse Nusbaum hit a two-run double. The Mules added two more runs in the second when the Bison leftfielder misplayed a single by sophomore John Muha with two runners on.

The score remained 4-0 until the bottom of the seventh, when Gallaudet (2-4) put runners on first and third with two out. Scarzafava came in and allowed one run to score on an infield hit, but he retired the next hitter on a grounder to short.

Muhlenberg had to come from behind to win Game 2. Trailing 3-0 after three, the Mules scored two unearned runs in the top of the fourth. In the next frame, freshman John Scuderi began the winning rally with a single. Consecutive singles by sophomore Joseph Vila and Muha brought in the tying run, and Vila came home on a popup to shallow left-center.

Freshman Sean Stipa faced the minimum six batters over two innings to earn the win in his first career appearance, and Velys retired the side in the seventh on a strikeout and a pair of comebackers.

Muha had two hits in each game. Senior catcher Clint Lynch picked a runner off second base in the opener and threw one out trying to steal in the nightcap.

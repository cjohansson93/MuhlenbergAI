Women's Soccer Ties LebVal in Matchup of Regionally Ranked Teams
 Tuesday, September 16, 2014 - page 2







					 




On a day when it regained a regional ranking, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team found out that it is the equal – at least – of one of the teams it is ranked behind.

After a week out, the Mules re-entered the NSCAA Mid-Atlantic poll released today at No. 10, two spots behind Lebanon Valley. Muhlenberg then played Lebanon Valley to a 1-1 tie to set a school record for longest unbeaten streak to start a season and begin an important part of its schedule on a positive note.
 
Of the five teams the Mules (5-0-1) beat to open the season, only one has a winning record. The two opponents on Muhlenberg’s schedule this week – Lebanon Valley and McDaniel – entered the week a combined 8-1-1 and are ranked eighth and ninth, respectively, in the region.

The Mules had to play from behind for most of the night after the Dutchmen scored an early goal. In the second half, Muhlenberg began to dominate, keeping the ball in its attacking end for nearly the whole time.

The Mules took the first 12 shots of the second half but still trailed by a goal before senior Colleen Touhey – whose attempt to tie just a few minutes earlier was knocked away at the last second – dribbled across the top of the box, turned and fired the ball into the net for her seventh career goal with just over 10 minutes to play.

The equalizer seemed to energize the Dutchmen, who responded with an offensive flurry of their own that included a shot hitting the post. Muhlenberg regained control and fired off three shots in the last six minutes, but two were saved and one went wide, sending the game into overtime.

Lebanon Valley put the ball in the net in the first overtime period, but the goal was waved off due to an offside call. The Dutchmen had a good chance to win with about a minute left in the second overtime, but freshman Rachel Mizrahi, playing in the first game of her career, saved a low line drive on a free kick.

Muhlenberg finished with a 24-12 advantage in shots.

Softball Sweeps Susquehanna
 Saturday, April 12, 2014 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg softball team had a positive day on its field and another one.



The Mules wrapped up their week of three doubleheaders against Landmark Conference teams with a 3-1, 3-2 sweep of Susquehanna. The Crusaders are currently in 
first place and in the Landmark, and last year they captured the conference championship and won three NCAA Tournament games before finishing with a 40-9 
record and a No. 24 ranking in the final Division III poll.

In Centennial Conference action, Haverford swept Franklin & Marshall, leaving the Mules (19-7) alone with two losses in the CC. Washington, McDaniel and 
Haverford all have three, with F&M dropping to four. Muhlenberg has three CC doubleheaders left, against Dickinson, Ursinus and F&M.

Juniors Kelsey Jones and  Heather Porrini combined to limit the Crusaders to one earned run an 14 hits in the two games. 
Jones pitched a six-hitter in the opener for her 10th win of the season, and Porrini did not allow an earned run in the nightcap.

The Mules jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second inning of the first game on some clutch hitting by sophomore Alexis Giovinazzo. After sophomore
Taylor Trifiolis and senior Colleen O’Donnell led off the inning with singles, they were sacrificed into scoring
position by sophomore Amie DeFeo. They remained there when the next batter struck out, but Giovinazzo (left) picked up her teammate,
delivering a two-run single to right.

Susquehanna cut the gap to 2-1 and threatened to tie or take the lead in the sixth when it put runners on second and third with one out. But Jones got a lineout
and a strikeout, then retired the side in order in the seventh after the Mules scored an unearned insurance run in the seventh.

As it did in the first game, Muhlenberg took the lead in the second, plating three in the fourth. Junior Alyssa Schell led off with a single, one 
of three hits she had in the doubleheader. Senior Kelly Kline also singled, and both players came around to score when Trifiolis hit a ball
through the left side that the Crusader leftfielder overran.

Trifiolis made it all the way to third on the play and scored on DeFeo’s two-out single.

Susquehanna (15-11) scored two unearned runs in the bottom of the sixth, but Porrini worked a 1-2-3 seventh to complete the sweep.

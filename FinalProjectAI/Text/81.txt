Miss You Like Hell
A Musical
Feb 24-27, 2022in the Baker Theatre
Book and lyrics by Quiara AlegrÃ­a HudesMusic and lyrics by Erin McKeown
Directed by Jamie McKittrickChoreographer: Samuel Antonio ReyesMusical Director: Vincent Trovato
A mother & daughter's journey of a lifetime into the heart of America. 
Whip-smart and deeply imaginative, 16-year-old Olivia hasn't seen her mother, Beatriz, for years. Now on the brink of deportation and hoping to make up for lost time, Beatriz cajoles her daughter into coming along on a cross-country expedition with a deadline. An intense, rambunctious new musical by Pulitzer Prize winner Quiara AlegrÃ­a Hudes ("In the Heights," "Water by the Spoonful") and acclaimed singer/songwriter Erin McKeown, "Miss You Like Hell" brings audiences on a desperate, joyous, uniquely American road trip. 
"Powerful & complex. A fresh take on the American road story, filled with people and ideas we rarely get to see onstage." âThe New York Times
"Honest and authentic... an unforgettable musical journey." âDCMetro Theater Arts
"It's a treat to spend time with complex Latinx characters who buck stereotypes." âTime Out NY

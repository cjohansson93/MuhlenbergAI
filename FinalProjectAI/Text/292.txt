Webconferencing is a way to connect teams remotely or via the internet in real-time for meetings and guest speakers. With a microphone and web camera, connect with a class of students online, or a guest speaker from a distance can join your class.
Zoom is currently in use at Muhlenberg as a webconferencing platform and option for faculty, staff, or student use. 
We have designed this webpage into sections based on existing user familiarity with webconferencing and Zoom as well as the situation bringing you to our resources.
General Support Information
I'm new to this
It's a new semester
I'm stuck/needing help
 
General Support Information
Zoom is accessed through the application portal via Muhlenberg.edu (the same area where one may access GSuite, Canvas, etc.).
Zoom works optimally with a webcamera and microphone, so make sure the room and/or your devices has both in advance.
You may contact ITMS to find hosting options on campus.
Learn more about equipment options for a Zoom session (if needed) via the Media Services form [form for faculty/staff only; requires log-in to access form]. 
We also have Zoom security recommendations for you to review before getting started as well as a refresher at any time.
Do know that the Zoom application is installed in each classroom and College owned device.  You can search for the application and enter your meeting that way in the event that the application portal/OneLogIn tile is not working optimally for you at any given time.  For more on this option, please review this ITMS video as well as Zoomâs downloading the desktop application (for personal devices), starting the desktop application, and using the desktop application to join a meeting documentation.
For those interested in using other tools within Canvas, such as Panopto, VoiceThread, etc.,  please note that our new website will ultimately include areas for the Learning Management System, Collaboration Tools, WebConferencing, and Media Services, so that each set of tools will have its own webpage accessible through the main ITMS website.
I'm new to this
Keep in mind the suggestions under "General Support Information" when it comes to Zoom sessions here at Muhlenberg. Webconferencing can be used for classes and for meetings, as well as for connecting guest speakers from a distance.
This ITMS worksheet explains how to access and set-up Zoom sessions.
Best practices include making sure sessions are scheduled where a microphone and camera are available, and any Media Services requests are made in advance, mindful of the rules and the form both provided in the Media Services webpage.

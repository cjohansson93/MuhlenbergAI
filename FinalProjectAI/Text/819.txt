Something Entirely Newâ: Queer Resistance and Hegemony in Steven Universeâ
Although Steven Universe is the first to present unambiguously gay characters and couples on an American childrenâs cartoon, it is important to consider how gay characters are presented and what this work does.  This qualitative analysis examines how Steven Universe resists heteronormativity through explicit expression of same-sex desire, the coding of same-sex desire and in-group jokes, and criticism of the nuclear family.  However, Steven Universe also reinforces heteronormativity by recirculating widely held beliefs about homosexuality through a variety of stereotypes and subtle erasure of gay characters.  Ultimately, Steven Universe is, by many standards, the best gay representation currently on childrenâs television.  Unfortunately, Steven Universe continues to utilize various stereotypes and through its depiction, continues to render heterosexuality as the hegemonic ideal.

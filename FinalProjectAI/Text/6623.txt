Women in Top 10 Again as Mayden Earns NCAA Cross Country Bid
 Saturday, November 10, 2012 - page 2







					 





Mayden is the second runner in Muhlenberg women’s history to earn all-region honors three times. She will be the first Mule female to compete in
the national meet twice.


The Muhlenberg women’s cross country team went into the NCAA Mideast Regional with an eye to finishing in the top five to put itself in a position to be considered for a bid to the NCAA Championships. Although the Mules caught a bad break and came in eighth, that in itself bore testament to the great strides they have made.




Munyan finished in 76th place in a field more than three times as large as last year’s CC Championships, at which he came in 65th.




Muhlenberg’s men’s team finished 15th, a three-place improvement from last season and a sign that it is on the right track.


For the second year in a row, senior Samantha Mayden and junior Nicki Cronin earned all-region honors. Mayden came in seventh to match the second-highest finish by a Mule female at the regional and earned her second straight bid to the NCAAs, scheduled for next Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind. Cronin was 31st.

Senior Erica Bash, who had been sick all week, had to drop out of the race after 2½ miles. Still, without their No. 3 runner, the Mules finished in the top 10 in the region. 

Coming on the heels of last season’s program-best seventh-place showing, it was the first time the women were in the top 10 in back-to-back years. Just three years ago, Muhlenberg came in 25th at the Mideast Regional.

Freshman Melanie Tramontina, junior Jackie Shulack and junior Ramzy Burns rounded out the top five for the Mules.

The men came in 15th out of 49 complete teams with a young lineup that featured three sophomores, one freshman and only one senior in its top seven. Most of the team members ran times on the very hilly course that were comparable to what they ran on a flat course at the Centennial Conference Championships two weeks ago.

The top three runners for the Mules, junior Charlie Kline, sophomore Luke Munyan and junior Bobby McGetrick, lowered their times considerably from the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational, run on the same course six weeks ago. Kline improved by 34 seconds, Munyan by 29 and McGetrick by 58.

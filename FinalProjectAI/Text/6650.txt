Wrestling Finishes at Regional


The Muhlenberg wrestling team closed out its season at the NCAA East Regional, hosted by Gettysburg.

Seniors Chris Galletta and Matthew Parker both went 1-2 in their final appearances as Mules. 

Seeded eighth, Galletta pinned his first opponent before falling to the top seed, 7-2, in the quarterfinals. He then lost to the seventh seed, the same Ursinus wrestler who defeated him at last week’s Centennial Conference Championships, by a 3-1 decision. Galletta finished with a team-best 18-10 record, including 11 pins.

Parker won by injury default against the fourth seed in the first consolation round before getting eliminated by the sixth seed. He ended the season with a record of 17-15.

The top three finishers in each weight class qualified for the NCAA Championships.

Cronin split a 3:43.51 for her 1,200 leg.


On the weekend of last chance meets in Division III track and field, the Muhlenberg women’s distance-medley relay team gave itself a better chance of making the NCAA Championships.

Running on a flat track at Tufts, the quartet of junior Nicki Cronin, sophomore Kirsten Kuchera and seniors Erica Bash and Samantha Mayden broke the school record they set last year. The Mules crossed the finish line in third place with a time of 11:55.74, more than two full seconds faster than they ran on a banked track last year.

As of late Saturday afternoon, the time was the 10th-best reported in Division III this season. Ten DMR teams are invited to the NCAA Championships, and today is the last day to qualify.

Junior Stephanie Carnevale, who improved her chances for NCAA qualification with her preliminary run in the 60-meter hurdles yesterday, finished third in the final at the ECAC Championships with a slightly lower time. As of late Saturday afternoon, she was 14th on the Division III performance list, and 15 are invited in each individual event.

Muhlenberg’s other athlete to compete at the ECAC Championships, senior Isaiah Vaughn, ran a personal-best 22.65 in the 200 meters.

Psychology Day
Each semester, the Psychology Department and Psi Chi host "Psychology Day." At Psychology Day, students from all class years present and discuss findings from the internship or research projects they have conducted that semester or year. It is an opportunity for younger students who are considering a major in psychology to look ahead at the types of work done in Research Methods, Advanced Lab, Research Apprenticeships, Internships and Independent Studies. It is also a wonderful opportunity for older students, especially seniors, to look back, note their own intellectual development and mentor younger students. Students and faculty from across campus are invited to attend.

two football players honored by CC




Two members of the Muhlenberg football team were tapped by the Centennial Conference for weekly honors after the Mules’ 17-7 win against No. 22 Union.

Senior Frank Emmett (left) was named defensive player of the week. He made seven tackles for a Mule defense that held Union to 218 total yards and nine 
first downs. Emmett returned a fumble to set up ‘Berg’s first touchdown and deflected a pass that was intercepted. He is tied for the team lead with 11 tackles
through two games.

Sophomore Chase Nadell (right) was named co-special teams player of the week. He returned the second-half kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown that put
Muhlenberg ahead for good. Since 1998, the Mules have scored 19 special teams touchdowns – nine on kickoff returns, five on blocked punt returns, two on punt
returns, two on fake punts and one on a return of a fumbled kickoff.

• Men’s Golf Ninth: The Muhlenberg men’s golf team was in ninth place out of 18 teams after the first round of Allegheny’s Guy W. Kuhn Invitational. With a
team score of 312, the Mules were just four strokes out of fourth place and six strokes back of St. Vincent, the top Division III squad. Division II schools 
California (Pa.) and Clarion led the field. Junior Zachary Oyer and freshman Brandon Davis were tied for seventh with a 74 after the first 18 holes; only
two Division III golfers shot better.

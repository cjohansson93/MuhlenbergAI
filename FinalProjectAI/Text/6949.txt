Softball Sweeps Drew to Reach 20-Win Mark

Two Lose at Haverford



Men’s Lacrosse




A three-goal run late in the first quarter proved to be the difference as the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team lost at Haverford, 7-5, in a game delayed more than an hour in the fourth quarter by lightning.

The Mules (6-6, 2-3) trailed 4-1 late in the first and traded goals with the Fords for the rest of the game, never getting closer than two goals.

Senior Jack Reilly was involved in four of Muhlenberg’s five goals, scoring two and assisting on two.

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team suffered its second straight 9-0 loss to a Centennial Conference opponent, falling at Haverford, the eighth-ranked team in the Atlantic South Region.

Senior Angie Sisco retired the last seven batters to finish off a six-hitter in the opener. With a 7-3 record, she has a new career best for wins in a season.



Unlike the 20-mule teams that hauled borax across the Mojave Desert in the 1880s, the latest 20-Mule team had to deal with some rain.

The Muhlenberg softball team completed a doubleheader sweep of Drew and reached the 20-win mark for the 10th time in program history with a 5-1 win in a game that was delayed by rain twice and finally stopped with one out in the bottom of the seventh. The Mules won the dry opener, 8-4.

Muhlenberg has won 10 of its last 12 games, running its season record to 20-5-1. The only times the Mules got to 20 wins faster were 1989 (23 games), 1990 (23 games) and 1991 (25 games).

Senior Jessica Costa, junior Erica Wenzel and freshman Taylor Trifiolis each had three hits to lead a 15-hit attack in the opener. Trifiolis and sophomore Alyssa Schell hit two doubles apiece. The Mules totaled six two-baggers, one short of the school record.

Drew (10-16) scored twice in the bottom of the first to take a 2-0 lead, but Muhlenberg scored in five of the remaining six innings and also had two runners thrown out at the plate. Trifiolis’s two-run double in the third gave the Mules the lead for good.

In the second game, freshman Amie DeFeo, making just her third start of the season, capped a three-run second inning with a two-run single for her first career RBIs. Trifiolis knocked in the final run with her fifth hit of the day, a single in the fifth.

Sophomore Heather Porrini pitched her second straight complete game, scattering eight hits and striking out four.

Freshman Alexis Giovinazzo had a hit and an RBI in each game.

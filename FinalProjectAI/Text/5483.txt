Cross country teams sweep


The Muhlenberg women’s cross country team has gone streaking.

For the second year in a row, the Mules won the Mule/Falcon Classic. While last year’s race 

came down to a single point over Georgian Court, this year the women beat second place Georgian Court by 32 points, putting three runners in the top 10.

“It’s exciting. We’ve started a streak,” said sophomore Kim Bier, who finished fifth overall and was the second Mule runner across the finish line. “Everyone raced really well today.”

“Cross country revolves around pack running and today was a good initiation,” said third-place finisher Kate Mahoney, the first Mule runner in a time of 20:58.2.

Bier and Mahoney, who were together most of the race, said the hardest part of the course was the final hill of the race.

“I kept telling myself, it’s just the big hill and then I’m done,” said Mahoney. “But having Kim there helped. It’s nice to have your teammate right there and we work really well together.”

Freshman Melissa Ugelow finished ninth overall and sophomore Abby Simons, freshman Sarah Lawrence, junior Lauren Conicella and senior Kathryn Niedzwiecki all finished in the top 21. Muhlenberg’s first and seventh runners were separated by just 1:43.

Muhlenberg’s men won the meet for the first time since 2002, having kept out their top squad the past few years. Ranked ninth in the Mideast Region, it was no surprise they won by a margin of 27 points, placing seven runners in the top 10. 

The men used the meet as a way to work on pack running in competition. 


Senior Timothy VanSyckle placed second overall, with a time of 27:23.6. Bobby Torphy, Rob Nihen, Stuart Udis and Steven Monteleone finished third, sixth, seventh and eighth, respectively, and were separated by just 1:32.

“We came out to dominate,” said Nihen. “And to work as a pack and push each other.”

“We have David (Chorney) who’s been hurt and isn’t completely back, and Patrick (Thornton) who’s still hurt,” said VanSyckle. “But we’ve had a lot of younger teammates stepping up.”

Those young runners are sophomore Matt Lauletti and freshman William Lowery, who were Muhlenberg’s sixth and seventh runners, and also sophomore Torphy, who is emerging as someone his teammates look up to.

“I lost it in the fourth mile,” said Nihen. “And I tried to keep my eyes on Bobby. He’s a great leader on the team.”

“It’s early in the season,” said Udis. “And we’re building toward the end. This was a great start. We were really strong with the pack running, keeping contact and working together. That’s going to help us in future meets.”

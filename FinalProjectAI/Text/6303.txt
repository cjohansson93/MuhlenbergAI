Men's Golf Battles Wind to Finish Third at Moravian

A little wind couldn’t keep the Muhlenberg men’s golf team from posting its highest finish of the spring season. The Mules placed third in a field of 18 teams at the Moravian Spring Invitational, jumping five spots from their finish at the same tournament in the fall.

Senior Zack Meyers and sophomore Christopher Lucarelli led the way, carding a pair of 78s to tie for fourth, three shots off the winners.

Meyers (left) finished with four birdies to post his best score of the spring season. He shaved an impressive 11 shots off his score at the same course in the fall and has broken 80 in each of his three rounds in 2012.

Lucarelli carded three birdies to tie for fourth for the second straight tournament. He has broken 80 in six of his 10 career rounds.

Muhlenberg finished four shots ahead of Lehigh Valley rival Moravian and 12 shots clear of the only other Centennial Conference team in the field, Ursinus.

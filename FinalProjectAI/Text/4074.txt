football coaches volunteer at fundraiser camp







Head coach Mike Donnelly and several of his current of former assistants on the Muhlenberg staff volunteered at the eighth Laurens First and Goal Football Camp last Sunday.

The camp is the primary fundraiser for Laurens First and Goal Foundation, and all proceeds from the event go directly to its mission of providing financial support for brain tumor research and cancer services, offering financial and emotional support to families living with pediatric cancer and increasing awareness of the disease.

Created in 2004 by John and Marianne Loose in honor of their 14-year-old daughter Lauren, a pediatric brain tumor survivor, LFG has raised $199,658 this year. Since its inception, the foundation has donated more than $800,000 toward the fight against pediatric brain tumors and cancer.

More than 1,800 high school student-athletes participated in the camp, held at Lafayette College. This years event set camp records for number of players registered and camper donations. 

During the one-day camp, players received instruction in a variety of offensive and defensive skills from college coaches from around the country. Almost 300 coaches representing 100 colleges and universities volunteered at the event. UConn head coach Paul Pasqualoni was the featured guest speaker and addressed the athletes, who came from 16 different states and Singapore.

In addition to the Pennsylvania event, LFG will host its second annual Lauren's First and Goal Football Camp Ohio on Sunday, June 26 at Otterbein University.

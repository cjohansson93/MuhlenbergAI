WMUH celebrated the 70th anniversary of its first official meeting with an exhibit at Trexler Library last spring. This academic year marks 70 years on the air.
This year, Muhlenbergâs radio station, WMUH, celebrates 70 years of being âThe Only Station That Matters.â An exhibit last spring at Trexler Library cataloged the stationâs history with archival items such as a quilt made from a variety of WMUH T-shirts, news clippings from the 20th century and a photo of the stationâs original members. WMUH began with a club meeting of 10 students on February 26, 1948. The first broadcast from the station aired later that year, on November 4.
âI think the fact that we have been here for 70 years says something about what we do,â says General Manager Paul Krempasky. Krempasky was a volunteer community DJ at the station for more than 30 years before beginning his current role in June 2017. âWe have played an important role in radio, in the community. We are the birthplace of community radio in the Lehigh Valley.â
WMUH is known for its 24/7 broadcasting, for its programmingâincluding one of the longest running arts and culture shows in the Lehigh Valley, Art Newsâand for its musical diversity, including shows like Music of India, Latin Sunday and Festa dâItalia.  
Krempasky has launched programming that celebrates the College. For example, Muhlenbergâs Theatre and Dance Departments promote their offerings in a monthly show thatâs both broadcast and available for streaming. Additionally, Krempasky has worked with the âLiving Writersâ series by broadcasting interviews with the authors when they come to campus. There are also programs featuring staff from the Office of Student Engagement, Counseling Services and the Career Center. âWeâre trying to get all aspects of the College involved and let them know, not only are we here, but we are here to help them promote their message,â Krempasky says.
What has kept WMUH going for so long is constant support from volunteersâboth community members and studentsâand listeners (approximately 10,000 each hour, on average). âWMUH is unique, and we couldnât do it without the support of both College and community,â Krempasky says. âI would like to see another 70 years.â If you would like to support WMUH, click here.

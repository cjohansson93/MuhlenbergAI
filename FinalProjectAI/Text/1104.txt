Important Health and Safety Update for the Spring Semester



A message from Vice President of Human Resources Jill Walsh to Muhlenberg faculty and staff

Monday, December 20, 2021

Dear Faculty & Staff:
This past semester we have been fortunate to experience very low levels of COVID-19 transmission on campus due in large part to the high rate of vaccination among our students, faculty and staff. As the more transmissible Omicron variant combines with the waning effectiveness of COVID vaccines over time, we are seeing a rise in breakthrough cases across the country. The current conditions have led Muhlenberg to update our vaccination policy for the spring semester to include boosters.
Muhlenberg faculty and staff will be required to have received a COVID-19 booster shot as of Tuesday, February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible.
You are eligible for a booster:

At least 6 months after receiving your second primary COVID-19 vaccination of Moderna or Pfizer.
At least 2 months after completing your single primary COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnsonâs Janssen.

(Those who received another WHO-approved vaccine should consult the CDC guidance on when to get a booster if you were vaccinated outside of the United States.)
Students will also be required to obtain the booster shot by February 1 or within 30 days of becoming eligible. This policy update aligns with the CDCâs most recent guidance recommending that âeveryone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot.â In addition, moving forward many health experts believe that the likely definition of "fully-vaccinated" will change to include a third shot. 
You may submit proof of your booster by emailing your card to hr@muhlenberg.edu or bringing your vaccine card to HR (3rd floor Haas) during standard office hours.
Previously approved COVID-19 vaccination exemptions for faculty and staff will apply to the booster requirement as well. Approved exemptions do not need to be renewed.
We expect to offer a number of on-campus vaccine clinics after the winter break and will share details once they become available.  However, if you are currently eligible, we recommend you get your booster shot as soon as possible. Please see below for a list of local and national providers offering booster vaccines as well as a list of resources regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.
We will continue to monitor local and national conditions and to prioritize the health and well-being of our campus community. Based on current data, we are confident that booster shots will provide the most effective means to reduce spread of the virus, protect vulnerable members of our community, and ensure we continue to benefit from the in-person learning and community engagement that are the hallmark of the Muhlenberg experience.
Your efforts, both individual and collective, are the reason we have been successful in keeping our community safe. Thank you.
We wish you a happy and restful break.

Women's Golf Opens at Dickinson
 Sunday, September 15, 2013







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s golf team began its 2013-14 season by finishing sixth out of eight complete teams at the Dickinson Invitational yesterday.

The Mules’ team score of 409 was just three strokes off their best from last year.

Junior Christina Bryde (left) led Muhlenberg and tied for 11th out of 44 golfers by shooting a 92. Freshman Emily Unrue
was three strokes behind in her collegiate debut.

It was the first time the Mules had two golfers shoot in the 90s since the spring of 2008, and the first time they had two finish at 95 or lower since the 2007
Centennial Conference championship tournament, which they won.

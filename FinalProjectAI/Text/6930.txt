Softball Goes 1-1 on First Day of CC Playoffs
 Saturday, May 4, 2013







					 

 Track & field


The Muhlenberg softball team has been making history all season, and to win the Centennial Conference championship, it will have to make some more.




Barber's run scored was the 115th of her career, putting her in sole possession of first place on the Mules' all-time list. She had two hits in the Washington game.



The top-seeded Mules (31-8-1) split two games on the first day of the CC playoffs, losing their opener, 3-2, to Washington College before staving off elimination
with a 4-0 shutout of defending champion McDaniel. Muhlenberg will face Haverford again in another elimination game on Sunday at 10:00. The
winner of that game will need to defeat Washington twice to claim the title.

Since the CC playoffs began in 2001, no team has won the championship after losing its first game.

Sophomore Kelsey Jones pitched both games for Muhlenberg and allowed runs in only one of 14 innings. She tossed a four-hit 
shutout against McDaniel, setting a school record with her 17th win of the season and tying another mark with her 20th complete game.

The Mules scored two runs in the first inning of both games. Against Washington, Muhlenberg loaded the bases on two walks sandwiched around
a single by junior Erica Wenzel. The runs came in on a sacrifice fly by freshman Taylor Trifiolis and
a single by junior Colleen O’Donnell. 




Schell went 2-for-3 in the McDaniel game.



Muhlenberg did not score again, however, stranding eight runners over the final four innings. The Shorewomen (24-17) took advantage of Mule
fielding miscues to score three runs in the fifth and made the lead stand up. The loss was the first for Jones against a CC opponent this
year and snapped the Mules’ 10-game winning streak.

In the second game, it was Muhlenberg that benefitted from errors, scoring four unearned runs. Junior Alyssa Schell led
off the game with a single and went to second when Wenzel’s pop fly was dropped. After advancing to third on a passed ball,
Schell scored on a ground ball by freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski. Wenzel and freshman Nicole Iannarone
combined on a double steal to bring in the second run.

Muhlenberg scored two runs without a hit in the fourth. Senior Devon Barber was hit by pitch for the school-record sixth time this season and came all the way 
around to score when a bunt by freshman Alexis Giovinazzo was thrown away. Giovinazzo scored on a groundout by senior
Jessica Costa.

Jones gave up only two hits – both to the same batter – after the second inning and got defensive help from over-the-shoulder
catches by O’Donnell at short and Giovinazzo at third. She permitted just one Green Terror (23-17) to reach third base, striking out
three in her fourth shutout of the season.

In the other games, Haverford defeated McDaniel 3-2 in eight innings, and fourth-seeded Washington advanced to the championship round with a
4-2 win against Haverford.

Background B.A., University of Louisville M.A., Ph.D. Indiana University
With a concentration in Latin American Twentieth Century Poetry, J B-P has most recently worked with indigenous poets from south-central Chile who publish their work in bilingual format (Spanish/Mapuzugun). These poets, and other Mapuche artists, are currently experiencing a heightened interest in the preservation of their culture and the environment around them, from their own people as well as from others - at the same time that they battle the pressures of assimilation and 'progress' in one of the strongest market economies in South America.

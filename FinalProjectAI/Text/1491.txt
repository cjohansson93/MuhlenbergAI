âI love Muhlenberg and one of my proudest moments was walking my daughter across the stage as she earned her degree.â Rudy Favocci â79, Pâ12

Volunteer Leadership Service Award

Lee Kreidler â59, Pâ85
Lee supports education students at Muhlenberg by serving on career panels and as a mock interviewer for student teachers. His class of 1959 has achieved the highest class gift or greatest class participation several times thanks to Leeâs leadership as class fund chair. He has served on the Board of Trustees and the Alumni Board and been a consistent donor and member of the Henry Melchior Muhlenberg Society.

Enrollment Verifications
Students are frequently required to obtain an Enrollment Verification for governmental or private agencies to prove that they are enrolled students.  Many require verification of "full-time" or "part-time" status.  College policy and the provisions set forth in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 are followed in providing information.  Muhlenberg College uses the following definitions for full-time and part-time status:
Full-time: 3 or more units registered during the semester Part-time: less that 3 units registered during the semester
Muhlenberg College has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to act as our agent for all verifications of student enrollment.  Please visit the Clearinghouse online at www.studentclearinghouse.org or contact them by phone at (703) 742-4200 or fax at (703) 742-4239.
Students at Muhlenberg may also get an Enrollment Verification themselves through a link to the National Student Clearinghouse site.  See Student Self-Serve Enrollment Verifications.

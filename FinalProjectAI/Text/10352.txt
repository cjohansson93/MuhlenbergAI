âBeing a first-generation college student means that we have the privilege of multidisciplinary learning at an undergraduate institution, which generations before us did not have,â said Sofia Herrera â22, a speaker at the 2022 Tri-Alpha Honor Society Induction Ceremony. âAnd we can open doors for others to have the same opportunity.â
Herrera, a neuroscience and public health major who is headed to Northwestern University this summer to earn a master's of public health, helped welcome the 18 newest members of Muhlenbergâs first-generation college student honor society on April 22 in the Seeger Union Event Space.

Sofia Herrera â22 addresses the new inductees.
To be eligible for the Tri-Alpha Honor Society, students must have completed at least three full-time terms, earned an overall GPA of 3.2 and come from a family where neither parent nor any legal guardians earned a bachelorâs degree. 
Alpha Alpha Alpha was founded in 2018 at Moravian College, an initiative of Associate Provost Carol Traupman-Carr. Muhlenberg is the Delta, or fourth, chapter of Tri-Alpha in the country.

Associate Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology Gretchen Hanson Gotthard, interim director of the first-generation advocacy and support program, welcomed the newest Tri-Alpha members and their families to the celebration. As a first-generation student herself, Gotthard spoke about the impact these students have and will continue to have on their communitiesâtheir families, neighborhoods, hometowns, the College and the wider world. 

Tri-Alpha President Gianfranco Tiseo â22 congratulates Shuhong Tang â23
Speaker Brooke Vick, associate provost for faculty & diversity initiatives, said, âIâm so proud of you, and you should be very proud of yourselves. Itâs my privilege to see the paths you will create here and beyond. You are a community of pathfinders.â

Students interested in learning more about the first-generation advocacy and support program and Tri-Alpha may contact Professor Gotthard at gretchengotthard@muhlenberg.edu.
Congratulations to the New Members of the Tri-Alpha Honor Society

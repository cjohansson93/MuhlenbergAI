Rough Conference Openers for Other Teams



Men’s Lacrosse




Muhlenberg allowed only six goals in its Centennial Conference opener at Franklin & Marshall, but could not generate much offense itself and lost, 6-2.

Sophomore Jon Thomas scored his 30th career goal with three seconds left in the first quarter to cut the Diplomats’ early lead to 2-1,
but it would be more than 41 minutes before the Mules (4-4) would score again (also by Thomas).

Senior Ian Jones picked up six ground balls to break the school record for ground balls in a season. He has 79 with the season barely halfway over.

Junior Kelly Kline drove in three runs to tie the school record for career RBI as the Muhlenberg softball team opened Centennial Conference play
with a doubleheader split at Gettysburg.

The Mules (10-2 overall) used some late-inning magic to win the first game, 8-3, before dropping the nightcap, 10-2.

 

The opening game was tied 3-3 heading into the top of the sixth. With one out, senior Devon Barber singled and stole second. One out later,
she scored the go-ahead run on a single by Kline.

The Bullets (7-7) got the tying run to third with one out in the bottom of the inning, but sophomore Kelsey Jones retired the top two hitters in
the lineup on a groundout and strikeout to keep Muhlenberg ahead.

With one out in the top of the seventh, freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski (left) hit her first career home run, one of four hits she had in the game,
opening the door to a four-run inning that put the game away. With the bases loaded and two outs, junior Chelsea Benjamin delivered a two-run
single, and two batters later junior Erica Wenzel drew a bases-loaded walk.

Jones struck out nine and allowed only one run over the final six innings in improving to 6-0 on the season.

In the nightcap, the Mules opened up a 2-0 lead in the third on consecutive two-out RBI singles by Benjamin and Kline. The latter gave Kline 93 career RBI, tying
the school record set by former teammate Ashley Brewer (2008-11).

Gettysburg got a run back in the bottom of the third before blowing the game open with a seven-run fourth.

Sophomore Alyssa Schell had four hits in the doubleheader.

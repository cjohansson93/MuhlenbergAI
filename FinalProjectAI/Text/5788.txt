tennis freshmen impressive in debut





Druker won 6-2, 6-1 against a Greyhound player who was 18-4 last year. At No. 2 doubles, she teamed with Sutker to take a 7-0 lead before winning, 8-2.




The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team premiered its own version of “The Fantastic 4” at Moravian.

Fielding a lineup of four freshmen and two juniors, the Mules overpowered Moravian, 8-1, in their first match of the 2007-08 season. The Greyhounds won the Commonwealth Conference championship and received a bid to the NCAA Tournament last year.

The four freshmen – Caitie Druker, Sara Sutker, Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt – were practically invincible. They combined for comfortable wins at second and third doubles, and did not lose a singles set, although Winston retired after winning her first set.

Not to be outdone, the two “older” players, juniors Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld, teamed up for a doubles victory and won easily in singles play. Powell posted a 6-0, 6-2 win against a first-team all-conference player.

The result gave Muhlenberg a 2-1 lead in the Matte Award standings for the 2007-08 year. The next Matte contests are women’s soccer and women’s volleyball matches on October 2.

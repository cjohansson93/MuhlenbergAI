volleyball aces last non-conference test



The Muhlenberg volleyball team split a home tri-match for the second Saturday in a row, falling to Franklin & Marshall in three sets in the opening
match before rebounding to sweep Merchant Marine.

The Mules recorded 13 service aces in the latter match, their last one at home this season. Winners of three of their last four matches, the
Mules finish up with Centennial Conference road matches at Ursinus and Gettysburg next week.

Freshman Morgan Duggan led the service parade with five aces, and juniors Brooke McQueen and Davi
Gordon added three apiece. McQueen also led the attack with eight kills.

Duggan had a double-double with 15 assists and 13 digs vs. F&M.

Before the F&M match, Muhlenberg honored its lone senior, Caitlin Dombkowski, who was unable to play in the matches due to injury.

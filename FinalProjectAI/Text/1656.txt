Muhlenberg College To Host Exhibition Game With Israeli Traveling Basketball Team



On November 7, 2005, The Muhlenberg College basketball team will play the Israel at Heart basketball team in a one-time exhibition game at 7 p.m. in Memorial Hall, Life Sports Center.  


	 Wednesday, November 2, 2005  01:59 PM

Following the game will be a brief reception for the players of both teams and visiting delegates. 
The team is part of the Israel at Heart organization, whose purpose is to be goodwill ambassadors and to promote awareness and understanding for the State of Israel.  They have sent their teams all over the United States and Latin America in order to enlighten audiences about modern day Israel, and to emphasize that the conflict is only one aspect of life in Israel, and to show that, in many ways, Israelis are very much like Americans. 
Team members will be present on campus and will speak in political science, elementary Hebrew and Hebrew literature classes at the College, as well as meet and have lunch with children at the local Jewish Day School.
The Israel at Heart team will play ten exhibition games against NCAA division three schools throughout the month of November.

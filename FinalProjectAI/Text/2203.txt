Christopher Scheer  Class of 2007 Major in Theatre
Actor, Magician, Dialect Coach, Clown, Aerial Acrobat, and Puppeteer




Since graduating, I’ve performed at many different theatres and in many different states. My credits have included Actors Theatre of Louisville, Lost Nation Theater, and the New York Theatre Workshop. My special interests as a performer are primarily new works, classics, and physical theatre. I usually work out of NYC, where I freelance as a dialect coach, magician, and clown. Recently, my performing life has involved a great deal of puppetry, including work with the Jim Henson Company as well as with my own two-person company.
All of my accomplishments and developments as an artist can be traced back to my studies at Muhlenberg. The training I received in the Theatre and Dance Department was grounded enough to keep me focused but diverse enough to give me the special skills that have helped me compete in the theatre industry and find my own voice as a creative artist. The friends I made at Muhlenberg still form the backbone of my support network in the real world, and I am always happy when I get to work with fellow ’Bergers.

Message to international students from China from Health and Counseling Services
Thursday, January 23, 2020

Dear students, 
I am reaching out to you because we are following the news about the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in China.  We just wanted to connect with you as we know you might be worried about yourself, family, friends, and/or other issues this virus may cause in your home country.  It can be hard to hear distressing news like this when you are so far away.  If you have any questions or concerns or would like to talk with anyone about how you are feeling, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Health or Counseling Center, Tom Janis in the Academic Resource Center, the Dean of Students Office or Pastor Kristen Glass Perez.  
Take good care and have a good evening.
Dean Gulati Brynn Dorsey, Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services

Women's Track & Field Finishes Second at CC Meet

Gold medalists Ryan Hellings, Carnevale and Vaughn.




After finishing seventh at the Centennial Conference Indoor Track & Field Championships last year, the Muhlenberg women came back for seconds.

Not to finish seventh again, but to finish second. The Mules completed an impressive turnaround by tying for second, matching the best indoor finish in program history. The Muhlenberg men came in sixth.

The five-place improvement for the women tied for the best in the history of the meet, matching Ursinus’ 8-3 jumps in both 2002 and 2011.

It took an entire team effort, as 19 different athletes scored points, and it came down to the final leg of the final relay. The Mules needed to finish two places ahead of Haverford in the 4x400 to tie for second place, and they did just that when freshman Claire Thornton surged ahead of two opponents, one from Haverford, in the last few meters. Muhlenberg finished second in that race, seven hundredths of a second ahead of Ursinus and 33 hundredths of a second ahead of fourth-place Haverford.




Vaughn improved two places in the 200 at the CC indoor meet each of the last three seasons, going from seventh as a freshman to fifth as a sophomore to third last year
and first as a senior.




The silver medal was one of five earned by Muhlenberg in the meet. The lone gold went to junior Stephanie Carnevale, who had a sensational meet. Carnevale broke her own school record in the 60-meter hurdles to win her first career gold medal, and she shattered her school record by 14 hundredths of a second to earn a silver in the 60 meters. Carnevale also came in fifth in the 200 with a personal-best time.




In addition to her dramatic 4x400 finish, Thornton ran the third led of the DMR team that finished fifth with an ECAC-qualifying time.




Senior Samantha Mayden won a pair of silver medals in the mile and 3,000 meters, and senior Colette Faust completed a comeback from an injury that caused her to miss most of last year by earning silver in the high jump.

Junior Erin Saucier won a bronze in the pole vault, one spot ahead of senior Bre Biondi, who notched the highest finish of her career by coming in fourth. Seeded seventh, Biondi cleared 9-6 for the first time in her career on her final attempt to move up from sixth place to fourth.

Sophomore Kirsten Kuchera scored in three events, setting a personal best in the 200 and running on two placewinning relay teams. Senior Lexie Daniells also placed with two relay teams, as did senior Tara Keegan, who ran on an injury that caused her to withdraw from the penathlon yesterday.

The 4x800 relay team of juniors Nicki Cronin and Lauren Zakheim, sophomore Cassiah Sahl and senior Erica Bash
won a bronze with the fastest time in program history on a flat track. Bash also was fourth in the 800.

For the men, senior Isaiah Vaughn won his sixth career gold medal, but his first in an open event, winning the 200 by more than a quarter-second. Vaughn also earned a bronze in the 60 meters and anchored the fourth-place 4x200 team.

Junior Andrew Onimus ran on two fourth-place relay squads and placed seventh in the 400.

A pair of freshmen, Brandon Tauber and Rami Hamdan, recorded personal bests to place fifth in the high jump and seventh in the shot put, respectively.

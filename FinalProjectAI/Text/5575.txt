second-half surge pushes men’s lacrossepast terror


When the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team quickly opened a 3-1 lead early in the first quarter against McDaniel, it looked like the Mules will breeze through their last home Centennial Conference game on the season. alas, they had to sweat to overcome a 6-3 halftime deficit before claiming a 10-7 triumph.

The win was the Mules’ fourth conference win this

season, something they have never done in CC action. With one game remaining in the league against direct playoff contender Ursinus on April 26, Muhlenberg (6-4, 4-3) has a realistic opportunity of making its first-ever CC playoffs. 

Despite being winless in league action and having lost chances for postseason action, the Green Terror (4-8, 0-6) put up a heroic first-half performance, threatening to upset a playoff-hopeful Muhlenberg.

After falling behind 3-1 eight minutes into the game, McDaniel scored five unanswered goals, shutting down its goal for the rest of the first half. 

Senior Luke Silverman, who had entered the game in the second quarter to reinforce the Mules’ defense, and his senior teammates were additionally motivated to make a turnaround as they were about to miss the last train for the CC playoffs provided they lost this game.

“It was a horrible feeling when we were down 6-3 at halftime,” Silverman said. “In the second half we came out extremely desperate to win because we worked our butts off this season and didn’t want to miss the opportunity.”

Entering the second half, the Mules had undergone an evident metamorphosis as they 
returned their focus and intensity back in both defense and offense, outscoring the visitors, 7-1. 

Muhlenberg completed its uphill battle early in the fourth quarter, finally tying the score 55 seconds in when freshman Brent Siebold converted a pass from senior Kyle Farris. With 11:18 showing on the clock, senior Mickey Norton, who usually dishes out the assists, was on the receiving end of a pass from Siebold and whipped the ball home for the go-ahead goal.

Besides limiting the Green Terror to only one goal in the final 30 minutes, the Muhlenberg

defenders had a key role in the production of the goals. Junior longstick John DeLuca capped off a memorable raid of his own, cutting the deficit to 7-5 with 2:35 remaining in the third period.

In the fourth quarter, DeLuca’s colleague in defense, sophomore Matthew Schroeder, after clearing the ball and avoiding a couple of McDaniel defenders, was about to lose his balance and give up the ball, but as he was falling on the ground he managed to pass the ball to an open Siebold, who converted his second on the day to make it 9-7 for the Mules. 

Farris turned in yet another standout performance for Muhlenberg with two goals and two assists. Siebold also finished with four points on two goals and two assists. 

 “I expect a hard fight because they’re a very physical team and we have to match that,” said Silverman about the upcoming decisive CC game against the Bears. “If we play against Ursinus the way we played in the second half today, we will definitely win.”
 
The Mules will be able to warm up for the crucial matchup with a three non-conference home games in an eight-day span – FDU-Florham (April 16), Montclair State (April 19) and Moravian (April 23).

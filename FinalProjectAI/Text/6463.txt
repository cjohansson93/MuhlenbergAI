Boll and Erin Murphy (11) go up for a block against McDaniel. 


Simpson-Bowles is a plan aimed at reducing the federal debt. Hynson-Boll is a duo that can keep the Muhlenberg volleyball from getting too far into the red.

Sophomore Holly Hynson and freshman Katherine Boll combined for 50 kills to lead the Mules to a sweep of a tri-match at McDaniel. Muhlenberg won its Centennial Conference opener against the host school in four sets, then swept Goucher to improve to 8-3.

Hynson put down a match-high 15 kills against McDaniel to go along with 10 digs and four aces. Boll, who had 14 kills in the first match, added 11 without an error vs. Goucher.

The Mules started slowly against McDaniel, falling behind 10-6 in the first set, but went on a 7-0 run behind the serving of freshman Chelsea Kaser, who had back-to-back aces. They went on to capture the set, 25-18.

The second set was the most dramatic of the day. Muhlenberg came back from a 17-10 deficit to tie the score at 19, then rallied again to save five match points after falling behind 24-20. The Green Terror (4-7) scored the last three points, however, to pull out the 29-27 win.

An 8-2 run in the middle of the third set paved the way for a 25-18 win that put Muhlenberg up 2-1. The fourth set went similarly to the first, with the Mules falling behind 9-6 early on.  Kaser’s fourth ace of the match capped a 7-1 surge to make the score 13-10, and Muhlenberg never trailed again, finishing off the match with a 25-19 win.

Freshman Joanne Josephson had four kills, an ace and a match-ending block in the fourth set. She finished with nine kills and four blocks. Kaser led the defense with 18 digs, and sophomore Julia Elkin added 10. Freshman Vanessa Pulice recorded 33 assists.

The Mules won the three sets vs. Goucher more comfortably, 25-15, 25-18 and 25-14. Hynson added 16 digs to her 10 kills for her second double-double of the day, while Kaser pulled up 21 digs. 

Freshman Sarah Weyhmuller had five blocks, and sophomore Lindsay Gambocurta contributed seven kills.

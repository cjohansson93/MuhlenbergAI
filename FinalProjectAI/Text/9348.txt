Shepard is the mother of slain 21 year old University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard, who was believed to be targeted because he was homosexual. Twelve years later, Shepard advocates for the prevention of hate crimes. She speaks to audiences about how they can make their schools and communities safer for everyone. Shepard hopes that people will treat others with respect, regardless of their race, religion, or gender identity and/or expression.
Shepard and her husband are the co-founders of the Matthew Shepard Foundation and advocates for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights). Aside from Board Director of the Foundation and traveling around to advocate on the behalf of LGBT men and women, Shepard wrote The Meaning of Matthew, a memoir about how she and her family have dealt with the proceedings after Matthew’s death.

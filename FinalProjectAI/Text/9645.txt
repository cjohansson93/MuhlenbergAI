Center for Ethics to wrap fall programming with hip-hop theatre events



The Center for Ethics will wrap up the fall programming of "Troubling Truth" on Nov. 16 and 17 with two hip-hop theatre events.


	 Wednesday, November 15, 2017  00:55 PM

Rickerby Hinds, professor of playwriting in the department of theater film & digital production at the University of California, Riverside.
A âConversation with Hip Hop Theatre Pedagogy Pioneersâ will take place on Nov. 16 at 6 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum. Rickerby Hinds (above), professor of playwriting in the department of theater film & digital production at the University of California, Riverside and the only tenured Hip-Hop theater playwriting professor in the country, will join Kashi Johnson (below, right), an accomplished actress, director and professor of theatre at Lehigh University, in a conversation about hip-hop theatre. The event will be moderated by Sharrell Luckett, assistant professor of theatre.
There will be a performance of âDreamscapeâ and talk back on Nov. 17 at 2:30 p.m. in Baker Theatre. Created by Hinds, âDreamscapeâ is a riveting hip-hop theatre play that is loosely based on the true story of a young woman who was shot to death by officers while sitting in her car unconscious. The play is central to conversations surrounding situations like Ferguson, as it explores policing and surveillance and the devastating effects this phenomenon has had on communities of color.
In addition to the Center for Ethics, the 11/16-17 events are co-sponsored by Muhlenbergâs department of theatre & dance, Lehigh Universityâs Africana studies program, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Lehigh Universityâs department of theatre, Lehigh Universityâs women, gender, & sexuality studies program and Lectures & Forums. Any views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this (program) do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Through thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center for Ethics and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members.   Chris Sistare, professor of philosophy and co-director of philosophy and political thought, serves as director; Maura Finkelstein, assistant professor of anthropology, and Laura Taub-Pervizpour, associate dean for digital learning and professor of media & communication, serve as program directors.   During the spring 2018 semester, the Center for Ethics will continue to explore the theme of âTroubling Truth.â Confirmed events for spring 2018 include a Feb. 1 visit by Sa'ed Atshan, an expert on peace and justice studies and social movements in the Middle East; a Feb. 22 visit by filmmaker, educator and social justice advocate Chinonye Chukwu; and a March 27 visit by Elaine McMillion, filmmaker of âHollow,â an interactive documentary that examines the future of rural America through the eyes and voices of Appalachians. More spring events will be confirmed as the academic year progresses.

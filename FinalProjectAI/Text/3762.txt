field hockey falters in cc opener



Looking to turn the tide after dropping four non-conference games to begin the season, the Muhlenberg field hockey team lost its Centennial
Conference opener to Washington, 4-1.

The Mules attempted to make a comeback in the second half after falling behind 2-0. They had a string of four consecutive penalty corners early in
the period, finally converting on the fourth when senior Chessie Martinez blasted the ball past the Shorewomen goalie from the left of the circle.
Senior Amanda DiMarco assisted on the goal, which cut the deficit in half.

The goal was the first of the season for Martinez (right) and the sixth of her career.

Washington, however, regained its two-goal edge less than seven minutes later and added an insurance score later in the second half.

Sophomore Devon Barber made the defensive play of the game for the Mules when she hustled to stop a sure goal in the second half, poking the 
rolling ball away from the cage at the last second.

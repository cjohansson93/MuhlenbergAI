CHM 100 (Introductory Chemistry) or CHM 103 (general Chemistry i)
Students who are considering a major in the natural science, and/or prehealth coursework will take a chemistry placement exam.  Inform students that they will not be able to register for CHM 100 or 103 until they have completed the placement exam.  A recommendation will be made for each student, and the student should be informed by their advisor whether they should take CHM 100 or 103; the student can ultimately decide which course to roster.
Most students will be recommended for CHM 103; the following are indicators used to recommend that a student take CHM 100 in the fall semester prior to taking CHM 103:
MSAT score < 600, MACT < 27, low chemistry placement score and/or low confidence in taking a college-level chemistry course, math placement lower than Calculus I.  Levels and grades in high school science and mathematics courses are also considered.
Note that if students take CHM 100 in the fall, they can take 103 in the spring semester of their first year.  They need to complete CM 104 (General Chemistry II) prior to taking Organic Chemistry, and some upper-level biology courses (CHM 104 can be taken concurrently with BIO 175).  One option is to take CHM 104 over the summer to complete Organic in the sophomore year.

          Mathematics Placement
  








The Department of Mathematics & Computer Science administers an online mathematics placement test to all students. Advisors will receive placement information for their advisees based on the results of this test and responses to a questionnaire. Guidelines for the selection of math courses follow.
I. Health Professions/Biology (PreMeds)  Students should enroll in MTH 121: Calculus I, MTH 122: Calculus II, or MTH 223: Calculus III no later than the Spring term of the first year. MTH 122: Calculus II or MTH 119: Statistical Analysis should be enrolled in the following semester.
II. Other Science Students  Well-prepared students intending to major in math, physics, computer science, or chemistry should enroll in MTH 121: Calculus I the first semester, followed by MTH 122: Calculus II the second semester.
Students should consider taking a precalculus course at another institution prior to taking Calculus I if necessary. (Note that a course in precalculus does not transfer to Muhlenberg College.)
III. Social Science StudentsStudents intending to major in economics may enroll in MTH 121: Calculus I. Poorly prepared students may wish to take a precalculus course at another institution prior to taking Calculus I. (Note that a course in precalculus does not transfer to Muhlenberg College.)
In the Spring semester, students considering a major in Psychology should enroll in MTH 119: Statistical Analysis or MTH 121: Calculus I.
Other social science majors may take MTH 119: Statistical Analysis, MTH 121: Calculus I, or MTH 101: Topics in Mathematics. However, we do not recommend MTH 119 for students in their first semester. Consult with your advisor.
IV. Humanities StudentsStudents considering a major in English, Art, Music, Dance, Theatre, Language, Philosophy, Religion, etc. may enroll in MTH 101: Topics in Mathematics, MTH 119: Statistical Analysis, MTH 121: Calculus I, or Computer Science I. The reasoning skills requirement is also met by PHL 110: Principles of Reasoning and Argument and PHL 211: Formal Logic.
Note: An uncommitted student whose interests do not include mathematics could be well advised to postpone the reasoning (RG) requirement until a major is determined.






          Second Language Placement
  








Second Language course assignment:  1) Students electing to begin the study of a new language should enroll in Language 101: Elementary I. Students who have studied a language for fewer than 2 years may also enroll in the Language 101: Elementary I course, but they still need to take a placement test in that language to confirm that 101 is the correct placement. If they have studied a language in high school that we offer, they should also take the placement exam in that language, whether they are continuing in that language or not.
2) ALL students electing to continue the second language they already studied in high school MUST take the appropriate PLACEMENT EXAMINATION. Appropriate course assignmentâbased on a studentâs past language experience, including the scores belowâis determined by the Department. Advisors may not change placement without departmental approval. Students may not change their placement without consultation with the professor of their language course at the start of the semester, followed by confirmation by the Department Chair.
*Please note: placement does not change regardless of when the student takes their language course, so we highly recommend that students start their language study within the first 2 years at Muhlenberg.
3) Students who have taken any college-level courses in a second language at another institution must have the official transcript sent to the Registrar for those courses to count for credit. They must also take a placement test if they plan to continue studies in that language at Muhlenberg.   * Please note: Courses are credited towards completion of the second language requirement only once the Registrar receives the transcript.

4) Students scoring 4 and above on an Advanced Placement language test are exempt from the second-language requirement. They will receive credit for Language 204: Intermediate II with the Advanced Placement test. They may enroll in: Language 301 if they choose and when available. Exemption is only official when the official transcript has been sent to the Registrar by the College Board.
5) Students with very high placement scores who place into Language 204: Intermediate II may be invited by the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures to take the exemption test for possible exemption from the L2 requirement or placement into Language 301 or other advanced courses. This test will be given during August Orientation weekend. Only those students who are invited by the Department to take the exemption test can do so.

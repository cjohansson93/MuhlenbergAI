antonini repeatson all-america team


For the second year in a row, junior Cody Antonini of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was named an All-American by the
National Soccer Coaches Association of America.

Antonini was a second-team selection after making the first team last year. He led the Mules in scoring with 39 points on 16 goals and 7 assists. 
Heading into the national semifinals, he was tied for ninth in Division III in total goals and tied for 12th in total points. 
An All-Centennial Conference first-team selection for the second straight year, Antonini will enter his senior season tied for ninth on the 
programs all-time scoring list with 78 career points. 

Antonini is only the second two-time All-American in Muhlenberg history; the other is Ian Williams in 1989 and 1990. He is the fourth player in CC history
to earn All-America honors more than once.

Antonini was one of three CC players to make the 2010 All-America team – Swarthmore placed two players on the third team. Two schools had three 
All-Americans, including Stevens, the team Muhlenberg beat in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

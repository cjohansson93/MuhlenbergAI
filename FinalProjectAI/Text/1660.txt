âBerg Hosts Marathon Reading Of Homer's âOdysseyâ 



On Monday, November 21, Muhlenberg Collegeâs History 123 Class, taught by President Randy Helm, will host a marathon reading of Homer's "Odyssey" in Seegers Union, Room 108.  


	 Wednesday, November 9, 2005  01:59 PM

The reading will begin at 9:00 a.m. and will continue until the epic is finished, at approximately 10:00 p.m.  Light refreshments will be served throughout the day.
Students, faculty and staff will read in half-hour blocks, with four readers per block.
This is the third consecutive year that the College has hosted marathon readings of Homer’s work. Another “Odyssey” marathon took place in the fall of 2003, and last fall, there was a marathon reading of the “Iliad.”

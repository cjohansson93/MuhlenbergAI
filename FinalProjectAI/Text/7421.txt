Men's Golf Second at Camden; Men's Lacrosse Beaten by Washington
 Friday, April 4, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished second out of 15 teams at the RU-Camden Scarlet Raptor Spring Invitational.

In miserable conditions for golf, senior Chris DiMaio tied for second with a five-over-par 75. Only 11 of the 76
golfers broke 80 at the Pennsauken Country Club course, and two of them were Mules: Freshman David Barkley tied
for fifth place with a 78.

Senior Christopher Lucarelli and freshman John Froberg (left) rounded out the top four,
shooting 80 and 81, respectively,

Muhlenberg finished seven strokes behind Rutgers-Camden and 15 strokes ahead of Swarthmore, one of two other Centennial Conference
teams at the tournament. The second-place finish was the best of the year for the Mules.

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team ran up against a buzzsaw in sixth-ranked Washington College and suffered its seventh straight
loss, 16-2.

Playing a Friday night home game for the first time in nine years, the Mules averted a shutout when junior Jason Mertz
scored with 8:55 left in the fourth quarter. Mertz added a second goal on an extra-man opportunity later in the quarter.

Sophomore Kyle Larkin played the final 35 minutes in goal, making eight saves while allowing only four goals.

Mules teach Allentown girls


Close to 50 elementary and middle school girls from the City of Allentown were given an opportunity to play alongside some of Muhlenbergs finest on Monday.



Celebrating National Girls and Women in Sports Day, athletes from Muhlenbergs field hockey, volleyball, lacrosse, soccer and basketball teams gave the girls a brief introduction to their sports and taught them some of the basics. Afterwards they sat in groups, enjoyed a snack and talked about making healthy choices in their daily lives. 

For the athletes, it was an opportunity to connect with the community outside of Muhlenberg. While the girls got a chance to learn about some new sports and ways to stay active.

Having student taught in the area, I know that a lot of these girls have probably never been exposed to some of these sports before, senior basketball player Sheila Cook said. So to be able to give them a taste of a sport, and maybe have them say, Hey, Id like to try that, is really a neat experience.

It feels great to just spend some time with the girls, and hopefully a few of them will become future athletes.

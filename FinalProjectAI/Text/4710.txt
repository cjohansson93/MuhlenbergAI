Brewer an academic all-district selection  






Junior Ashley Brewer of the Muhlenberg softball team added to her season-ending list of honors by being named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division second team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team.

A chemistry major and mathematics minor, Brewer (left) was named the Centennial Conference player of the year after leading the league in batting average (.430), on-base percentage (.511) and slugging percentage (.684). She was second in the CC in steals (22) and led the Mules with three home runs, three triples and 12 walks. She drove in 13 runs and scored a team-high 22.

Brewer also shined on the mound, going 6-6 with a 3.65 ERA. She was sixth in the conference in batting average against (.239) and eighth in strikeouts (59) and pitched the eighth no-hitter in school history in the season opener.

Brewer is the ninth Mule softball player to be named Academic All-District and the first since 2006.

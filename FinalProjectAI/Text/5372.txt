horn wins petrofes title



Senior Matt Horn won the 184-pound title at the Messiah Petrofes Invitational.

Seeded second, Horn (right) decisioned the third seed from Wilkes, 9-4, in one semifinal. In the final, he needed only 75 seconds to pin his opponent, a Brockport
State wrestler who was the top seed. Of the 10 champions at the meet, Horn was the only one to pin a higher-seeded foe in the title bout.

The tournament title was the third as a Mule for Horn, who finished second and third while competing at 197 pounds in the first two tournaments this season.

Muhlenberg’s other two placewinners, senior Justin Fitch (174) and freshman Nick Pallotta (heavyweight), both finished eighth.

The Mules came in 12th in the team standings in a tournament that featured five teams ranked in the top 30.

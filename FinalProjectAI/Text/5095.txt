MEN’S SOCCER MAKES HISTORY IN ROAD WIN


On Saturday, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team accomplished something no other team in program history has before.

The Mules defeated Franklin & Marshall 4-0 to win their third straight road game by four or more goals, a feat not even the most successful of Muhlenberg teams has ever accomplished.

The big victory not only gave the Mules a new school record; it also gave them a momentum-building win against a regionally ranked opponent they have had trouble with in the past, and a 1-0 start in Centennial Conference play.




Freshman Kyle Plifka has started every game at center back for a Mule team that has recorded three straight shutouts on the road.





“We were just so fired up with this being our first conference game,” said senior Adison Weseloh. “There’s so much camaraderie on this team right now and everybody is motivated to perform well.”

Muhlenberg (4-2, 1-0) didn’t have to wait long for that motivation to pay dividends, as senior Eric Miller scored the game’s opening goal just 3:28 in. Junior Tom Reilly split two defenders with a pass that found Miller, who buried a shot into the bottom right corner.

Neither squad could find the back of the net for the rest of the first half, but for the third straight game, the Mules came out firing in the second, scoring three goals in a 10-minute span.

First Miller repaid the favor to Reilly, drawing the keeper out and passing to Reilly for an easy one-timer.

“Miller made a selfless pass to Reilly and Reilly finished,” said Weseloh. “That was textbook great teamwork.”

The Mules struck again at the 63:34 mark, when Weseloh sent a cross to sophomore Cody Antonini, who finished it for his team-leading seventh goal of the season.

Just over two minutes later Weseloh got a goal of his own – his first of the season – to seal another impressive road win.

The Muhlenberg back four once again played phenomenally, holding the Diplomats (4-2, 0-1), who came in ranked ninth in the region, to just two shots on goal. The Mules have not allowed a goal in their last 284:16 of action.

“Morale is really high right now,” said Weseloh. “We just need to maintain focus and not get too carried away with getting wins early in the season.”

men’s soccer celebrates early homecoming


One down, one to go.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team won the first of two consecutive home games against undefeated Centennial Conference foes by knocking off Dickinson, 1-0. The Mules face eighth-ranked Johns Hopkins in their Homecoming match on Saturday.

The win came in Muhlenberg’s first home game since September 1. That

was also the last time the Devils (7-1-1, 1-1-1) had allowed a goal: They came in unscored upon in more than 670 minutes, a streak they extended by blanking the Mules (5-2, 2-1) in the first half.

Five minutes into the second half, Dickinson was called for a hand ball 10 yards outside the box. 
Greg Leischner took the free kick and played a short ball to Billy Dalton, who had integrated himself into the Red Devil wall. Dalton laid the ball off to 
A.J. Barnold, who was cutting in from the left and put a shot away to the far post for his first career goal.

It looked like the play ran just as it was drawn up, but it really didn’t.

it across to Jonny [Kliewer], but his touch missed,” explained Barnold, a center back. “I was supposed to be the decoy. I don’t get too many chances to score playing my position, so it felt good.”

Although Kliewer didn’t get the pass on the game-winning goal, he did play a pivotal role in the game. With 8:15 left in the first half, a Dickinson back shot a missile off a cleared corner kick that would have crashed into the back of the net had not Kliewer headed it away.

The Red Devils – trailing for the first time 
all season – had a few more good chances to score in the second half. A shot went inches wide of the left post in the 53rd minute, and a goal in the 64th minute was wiped off by an offside call.

With less than 18 minutes remaining, Peter Bennett came far off the line to win a challenge against Dickinson’s leading scorer. The Red Devils were making another
bid at scoring when the final horn sounded.

“It got a little hairy there, but we pulled it out,” said Bennett, who finished with five saves. “We love playing at home, especially in big games. We have a great atmosphere here. The road was a tough stretch, but the game Saturday [a 2-1 overtime win at Gettysburg] gave us momentum.

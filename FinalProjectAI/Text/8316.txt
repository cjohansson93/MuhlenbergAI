Language students are uniquely situated to take on the challenges and opportunities that globalization offers, able to understand, appreciate, and critically analyze the perspectives of cultures other than their own. Chinese Language courses offer students the opportunity to acquire or advance communication skills in the Chinese language. The classroom experience is complemented by extensive use of the LC Commons, a state-of-the-art technological facility that provides software and other instructional material for student use in support of their program of study.
Note: Although students may not major or minor in Chinese at this time, Chinese language courses may be used to satisfy the College's Language Requirement.

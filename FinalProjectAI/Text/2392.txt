Professor Benjamin Hale Gives Talk for âBergâs Center for Ethics



Dr. Benjamin Hale, assistant professor of philosophy and environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, will give a lecture for this yearâs Center for Ethics series Market\Values 


	 Wednesday, February 13, 2013  09:58 AM

His talk, “Ethics, Environment and Markets,” is free and open to the public. 
Hale’s research has focused on exploring questions of value and market forces in relation to public policy, the environment, geoengineering, bioethics and much more.  Before joining the University of Colorado at Boulder, Hale served as the interim Director of the Environmental Studies Program and visiting assistant professor of environmental philosophy at New York University.  He has also taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, Hofstra University and Stony Brook University.  Hale received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Stony Brook University in 2004.  
Market Values is co-directed by Sue Curry Jansen, professor of media and communications, Mohsin Hashim, associate professor of political science, and Marcia Morgan, assistant professor of philosophy.  This year-long program examines historical and contemporary questions about markets and accompanying moral issues they raise.  The goal of the Center for Ethics’ programming is to engage the community in intensive and reflective thinking about individual and collective values.

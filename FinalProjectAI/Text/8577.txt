Jacqueline D. Antonovich 
Assistant Professor of History Ettinger 300D484-664-3323
Education :
Ph.D., University of Michigan M.A., University of Wyoming B.A., Colorado Mesa University
I am a historian of health and medicine in the United States, with particular interests in how race, gender, and politics shape the medical field and access to health care. My teaching interests include histories of public health, alternative medicine, disability, reproduction and childbirth, and epidemics. I also focus on the history of the American West, nineteenth-century America, and the Gilded and Progressive Eras.
My current writing projects include a book manuscript on women physicians and medical imperialism in the turn-of-the-century American West, and an article on the public health politics of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. I am also the co-founder and executive editor of Nursing Clio, a peer-reviewed blog project that ties historical scholarship to present-day issues related to gender, health, and medicine.

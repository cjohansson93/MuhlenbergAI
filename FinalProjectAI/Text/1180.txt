As co-chairs of the Middle-States Self-Study Steering Committee, we welcome you to this website where you will find materials from both Muhlenberg Collegeâs current self-study review process and its past accreditation activities. Muhlenberg College is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, 1007 North Orange Street, 4th Floor, MB #166, Wilmington, DE 19801.Our current review began in the summer of 2013 and was completed with the Middle States Team visit in spring 2016. We were pleased that the team noted the following in their overall assessment of the College: Overall, we wish to recognize that Muhlenberg is a caring, committed, and collaborative college. We witnessed this among all constituencies during our time on campus. It is an institution that inspires students and that has much to celebrate.The Visiting Team submitted their report to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and at their June 2016 meeting, the Commission acted to reaffirm accreditation and to commend the institution for the quality of the self-study report.We hope that members of the Muhlenberg community will review the documents related to our recent self-study process, as well as 2006 Self-Study Report and the Periodic Report issued in 2011.
Cordially,  Kathleen Harring, Ph.D. Giacomo Gambino, Ph.D.

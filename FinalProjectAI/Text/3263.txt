Senior David Mazzola of the Muhlenberg football team was named special teams co-player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Mazzola punted four times for a 44.0-yard average in the Mules’ 28-23 win at Johns Hopkins. His first two punts were downed inside the 5-yard line, and his third was fielded at the 10 and returned to the 16.

Mazzola’s fourth punt came late in the fourth quarter with Muhlenberg reeling. The Blue Jays had just scored their third touchdown, then forced the Mules back 14 yards in the next three plays. Punting from the 6-yard line, Mazzola helped slow the Hopkins momentum by unloading a 55-yard boot that was downed at the home team’s 39-yard line. Needing to travel 61 yards to win the game, the Blue Jays only crossed midfield before throwing an interception.

Mazzola also recorded four tackles and an interception in the game. He is averaging 35.1 yards on 16 punts this season.

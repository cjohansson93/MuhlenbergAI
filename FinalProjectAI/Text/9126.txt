Muhlenberg College/Morning Call Pennsylvania Presidential Election Survey: August 2020
In a new August 2020 Muhlenberg College/Morning Call election poll, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a narrow lead over President Donald Trump among likely Pennsylvania voters.
The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 416 likely voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between August 11 and 17, 2020.  With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence.

Key Findings: 

With election day 2020 a little over two months away, the latest Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll finds former Vice President Joe Biden holding a narrow 4 point lead (49%-45%) over President Donald Trump among likely Pennsylvania voters.
The Presidentâs efforts to once again win the Keystone Stateâs 20 electoral votes is hindered by the majority of Pennsylvania likely voters who disapprove of his handling of the presidency (51%), and who believe that President Trump does not deserve reelection (53%).



Despite his narrow lead over Trump in the poll, Biden also exhibits liabilities, with more likely voters in the Commonwealth viewing him unfavorably (46%) than favorably (39%).
In the midst of the economic struggles that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic, only 10% of likely voters in Pennsylvania said their financial situation is worse than it was before Trump took office, with 40% stating their financial situation is better now. These levels are largely unchanged since the last Muhlenberg/Morning Call poll in February.

"Given the current unemployment levels, we expected some shifts in these numbers," says Chris Borick, director of Muhlenberg's Institute for Public Opinion. "We know many peopleâs economic standing has suffered during the coronavirus pandemic crisis. I believe voters are appraising their economic situation not so much in the moment but rather over the span of Trump's presidency."


Democrats hold a 7% lead among likely Pennsylvania voters in terms of congressional elections in the state, with 45% planning to vote for the Democrat candidate in their district, compared to 38% backing Republican candidates.



As debates about mail-in balloting in Pennsylvania continue, about 2 out of 3 likely voters (64%) report that they intend to vote in person this November, with about 1 in 4 intending to vote by mail (26%), and 1 in 10 unsure of the voting method they will choose.
About 1 in 4 likely voters in the Keystone state indicate that as of the day they were surveyed they did not feel safe voting in person.
Likely voters in the Commonwealth are highly divided on the threat of fraud associated with extensive mail-in voting this fall, with 47% agreeing that there is a greater chance of fraud if most Pennsylvania vote by mail, and 46% disagreeing with this claim.

"As the debates surrounding mail-in ballots have become intense in Pennsylvania, we find that there is a stark divide among voters on how likely they are to believe this voting process is prone to fraud," says Borick.


The Presidentâs handling of the COVID-19 pandemic receives a very poor rating from Pennsylvaniaâs likely voters, with only 17% indicating he has done an âexcellentâ job on this issue, compared to 51% who rated his performance on this matter as âpoor.â
In regards to the means of instruction in Pennsylvania schools, a plurality of likely voters (39%) prefer a mix of in-person and online instruction, with smaller percentages supporting entirely online instruction (28%), or in-person instruction (22%).


Methodological Statement:
The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 416 likely voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between August 11 and 17, 2020.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (105) and cell phones (311). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. Interviewing was conducted by Communication Concepts of Easton, Pennsylvania under protocols established by the MCIPO.  The data has been weighted to gender, age, region, party, race and educational attainment to reflect voter population parameters. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above.  In order to reach a representative sample of registered voters both landlines and cell phones were called up to 3 times.  The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 11%. The sampling frame for the study is from the registered voters files of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  To determine likely voters, only voters who have voted in 1 or more of the last 4 general elections (2016-2019), or who is a new registrant since November of 2016 were included in the sampling frame.  In addition, only survey respondents from this frame who indicated that they were âdefinitelyâ or âvery likelyâ to vote in the November election were included in the sample. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by Christopher P. Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO), in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by the Morning Call and the MCIPO. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please call 484-664-3444 or email cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

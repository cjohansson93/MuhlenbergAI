June 14 - August 1, 2019

Peace 2019 [detail] 42" x 42" x 9.5"Paint, magazine, cloth, metal, plastic, cork, sharpie, pyrography on wood
Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to present In search of, an installation by Zach Kleemeyer. This exhibition features works that will be on public display throughout the summer in our Galleria display space, adjacent to the Paul C. Empie Theater, in our Philip Johnson-Designed Baker Center for the Arts.
Martin Art Gallery will host an opening reception in the CFA atrium on June 14th, from 4:45 â 6:15pm, in conjunction with two other shows opening that night - featuring new works by area artists Femi J. Johnson and Emily Strong, also on view from June 14 â Aug 1.
Lehigh Valley based visual artist, Zach Kleemeyer uses his passion for drawing as a point of departure in making a diverse variety of mixed media assemblage works.  Currently, Kleemeyerâs preferred medium is discarded or scrap wood.   He embraces the weathered qualities in his found materials, which are combined and manipulated with paint or fire and are organized into signs, symbols and forms that explore a unique set of aesthetic concerns.
Kleemeyer has shown his work at the Allentown Art Museum, the Bethlehem House Contemporary Art Gallery and his self-portrait will be included in a juried-in group exhibition for the Bethlehem Fine Arts Commissionâs biennial portrait show, also opening in June of 2019 in the Rotunda Gallery in Bethlehem, PA.  Zach studied messaging in college and earned an undergraduate degree in Communication Studies with a minor in Studio Art from Bloomsburg University. Currently, Zach helps to advocate for the arts on a regional level through his work at the Lehigh Valley Arts Council, based in Allentown PA.

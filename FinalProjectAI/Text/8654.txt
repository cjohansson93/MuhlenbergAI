Dana Scholars
The Dana Scholars Program of Muhlenberg College provides a four-year experience for outstanding students. Students who are invited into the Dana Scholars are typically near the top of their high school class and exhibit distinctive creativity, versatility and intellectual curiosity.
Muhlenberg Scholars
The Muhlenberg Scholars Program is designed to nurture talented students by providing a rich and stimulating environment in which they can realize their true potential. It seeks to foster creativity, independence and self-realization by bringing together faculty and students committed to the highest ideals of a liberal education. Through innovative course offerings, unique cocurricular programs and close student/faculty interaction, it strives to create a community of inquiry where the free exchange of ideas leads to new insights into one's self and one's world.
Scholars courses are small, interdisciplinary, discussion-oriented courses in which the student is encouraged to grapple creatively with problems at the forefront of current research. The emphasis is on original source materials rather than textbooks. The goal is to create a community of inquiry where professor and student reason together about topics of current interest.
Outstanding first-year students are invited to join the Scholars Program when they are admitted to the College. These individuals will normally have graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class and have significant extracurricular accomplishments.
RJ Fellows
The RJ Fellows Program is an honors community established at Muhlenberg College with support from the Scheller Family Foundation to foster and strengthen the decision-making and leadership competencies of liberal arts students whose intellectual curiosity is matched by a commitment to ethical change.
Outstanding applicants to Muhlenberg College who exhibit these qualities in their applications are invited to join the RJ Fellows Program. As well as being among the top graduates of their high school class, individuals invited to participate in the RJ Fellows community demonstrate a passion for leadership and change in their academic and extracurricular achievements, including community service.
Shankweiler Scholars
The Shankweiler Scholars Program is an honors program designed for highly motivated undergraduates who are preparing to pursue an M.D. degree after graduation and a life of serving humanity through clinical practice and/or research.
As a liberal arts premedical experience, the program is particularly well-suited for premedical students planning to major in the humanities or social sciences or natural science majors with broad intellectual interests.

Academic Honor Societies
In addition to the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa, Muhlenberg has several active chapters of nationally recognized honor societies to distinguish those students who have demonstrated high scholarship and leadership within a field of study.

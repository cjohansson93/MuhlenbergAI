Freshman Gridders Win CC Honors
 Sunday, November 10, 2013 - page 2







					 




Muhlenberg freshman football players Nick Palladino and John Feaster were honored by the Centennial Conference for their
roles in yesterday’s 41-10 win at Ursinus.



Palladino (left) was named offensive player of the week after setting a school record for freshmen with 339 yards passing and 
four touchdowns. His scoring passes covered 18, 53, 16 and 63 yards, and he also rushed for a 2-yard TD to tie the school mark of five
touchdowns responsible for in a game.
 



In addition to his 63-yard TD pass to junior Cody Geyer, Palladino also threw a career-best 66-yard completion to junior
Michael Long. It was the first time two different Mule receivers caught 60-yard passes in the same game since 2000, when
Alfredo Mercuri and Anthony Wolfsohn accomplished the feat against Dickinson.

For the season, Palladino has passed for 1,707 yards, a school record for freshmen and 140 yards short of the CC freshman mark of 1,847.

Feaster (right) was named defensive player of the week. The cornerback made six tackles, intercepted two passes and broke up another. 
His first pick set up a Muhlenberg touchdown, his second thwarted a Bear drive in the end zone, and his breakup came on third down.

The two interceptions ran Feaster’s season total to six – tops in the CC and a school record for freshmen. Feaster has four of his picks
in the last three games and is the first Muhlenberg player to intercept a pass in three straight games since Matt Rathbun in 2008.

For the television networks, sweeps weeks begin at the end of October. For the Muhlenberg volleyball team, sweeps week came at the beginning of the month.

The Mules posted three-set wins over Washington and Cedar Crest in a home tri-match, completing an impressive stretch of four sweeps in four days.

Including 3-0 wins against Bryn Mawr on Wednesday and FDU-Florham on Thursday, the average score of a set in the four matches was 25-15. Muhlenberg (12-6, 3-3)
will take the momentum from the four matches, which followed a three-match losing streak, into Wednesday’s match at Centennial Conference co-leader Franklin &
Marshall.

The last time the Mules won four straight 3-0 matches was 2005.

In the CC match against Washington, Muhlenberg scored five straight points behind the serving of freshman Joanne Josephson to turn a 9-8 edge
 into a 14-8 lead in the first set. Josephson served the last three points of the set, finishing it off with one of her three aces.

The Mules trailed 9-6 in the second set before going on an 6-0 run, again on Josephson’s serve, to go ahead for good. Freshman Katherine Boll
had two kills in the run and six in the set, which Muhlenberg won 25-21.

In the third set, Muhlenberg served five aces, including back-to-back ones by sophomore Julia Elkin (right) and jumped out to a 14-6 lead en route to a 25-14 win.

Sophomore Holly Hynson led a balanced offensive attack with 12 kills. Boll and freshman Sarah Weyhmuller recorded 10 apiece. Freshman
Chelsea Kaser (14) and sophomores Alyssa Schell (11) and Lindsey Gambocurta (11) all reached double figures in digs.
Freshman Vanessa Pulice had 30 assists.

Muhlenberg left little doubt in the second match, winning the first two sets 25-6 and 25-9. The first set marked the biggest win for the Mules since a 25-6 defeat of
Bryn Mawr in 2009. Since volleyball went to 25-point scoring in 2008, it was only the second time Muhlenberg held an opponent to single digits in two sets.

Weyhmuller had another outstanding match, recording kills on eight of her 10 attempts. She hit .500 in the two matches. Josephson recorded nine kills in 13 attempts
against Cedar Crest and had another long run of service points in the only close set, notching back-to-back aces in a 6-0 run that turned a 16-15 deficit into a 21-16
lead in the third set.

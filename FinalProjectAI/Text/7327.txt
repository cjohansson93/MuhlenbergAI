Women's Basketball Suffers First Loss of Season
 Tuesday, November 26, 2013 - page 2







					 






Sophomore Jordan Labbe hit a pair of three-pointers a minute apart in the second half for all six of her points.



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season in a high-scoring affair with Haverford, dropping an 87-80 decision.

The Mules (4-1, 2-1) trailed by as many as 12 in the first half, but closed the period on a 13-4 run and headed into intermission down 42-41. 
The teams battled through four ties and seven lead changes in the second half, with Muhlenberg grabbing the upper hand for the final time on a 
three-pointer by junior Abby Stenger that made it 70-69 with 5:21 to play. 

But the Fords (4-0, 2-0) – who received 14 votes
in the first D3hoops.com poll of the regular season – answered right back with a long ball of their own and kept the Mules 
at arm’s length by going 13-of-14 at the line down the stretch.


Junior Leanna Tallamy led four Mules in double figures with 18 points and snagged eight rebounds. Senior 
co-captain Erin  Laney had eight boards to go along with 12 points (including the first three-pointer of her career) and 
Stenger joined her on the strength of four threes of her own. 

Senior co-captain Colleen Caldwell scored a season-high 11 points and matched her career high with seven assists, set in Saturday’s overtime victory at Washington.

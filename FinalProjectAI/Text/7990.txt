Men's Golf Second at Home Tournament
 Monday, September 29, 2014 - page 2







					 





The last putt of the day sent the Muhlenberg men’s golf team back to campus with some hardware from its own tournament. 

Sophomore John Froberg sank a putt from the fringe to birdie 18, putting the Mules one stroke ahead of Penn State Harrisburg for a second-place finish out of 22 teams at the Muhlenberg Invitational. This was the second top-two finish for the Mules this fall. 


Froberg (right) shot a 33 on the back nine to end with a career-low 4-over-par 74, which was tied for seventh with junior Jonathan Graulich (left) out of 113 players. 

Freshman Evan Overcash shot a 7-over 77 to tie for 15th, and classmate Daniel Eidman was one stroke behind.

Muhlenberg’s team score of 303 was its lowest in three years.

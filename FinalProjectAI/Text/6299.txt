Men's Golf 4th in LV Cup; Moravian Clinches Share of Matte
 Tuesday, April 24, 2012







					 


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished fourth at the Lehigh Valley Cup in its final competition before this weekend’s Centennial Conference 
Championships.

After finishing ahead of Moravian in their last two head-to-head meetings (one in the fall and one in the spring), the Mules finished 27 strokes behind 
the Greyhounds in the designated Matte Award match. The point gave the Greyhounds an 8-7 lead in the 2011-12 standings and guaranteed them 
a share of the Matte Award. Muhlenberg can salvage a tie and keep a share of the trophy for the ninth straight year by winning Friday’s men’s tennis 
match.

Sophomore Chris DiMaio was the lone Mule to break 80, shooting a 79.

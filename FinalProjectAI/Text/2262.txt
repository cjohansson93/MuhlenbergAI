Time drags, time races, time spikes. Words stretch, words linger, words implode. We're on Zoom. We try. We fail. We manage. Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance presents âA List,â by the great American modernist Gertrude Stein, which director James Peck describes as âa short, endless play of words and longing.â
Peck, a theater professor at Muhlenberg, has approached the text as an investigation of the present moment of covid lockdowns and life on Zoom. The show runs (on Zoom, naturally) April 11-13 at Muhlenberg College Theatre & Dance. 
âGertrude Stein is one of the most daring and original playwrights of the 20th century, someone whose legacy in the theatre is unknown but in my opinion profound,â Peck says. âHer writing captures a strange sense of temporality. The production is seeking to look into the strange sense of time that zoom has created.â
The fourth instalment in Muhlenbergâs semester-long Mnemonic Theatre Festival, âA Listâ runs April 11-13, and will be presented in a virtual performance. Attendance is free. Patrons can request tickets at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow.
 An American novelist, poet and playwright who lived most of her adult life in Paris, Stein was a leading figure in the modernist movement of the early 20th century. She was known as an avant-garde writer â eccentric, often non-linear, and experimental â and was a self-proclaimed genius. 
âI passionately love Gertrude Steinâs theatre, and Iâm a bit possessed by the desire to help other people love it too,â Peck says. âFor the past few weeks, the cast and I have been attempting to give body and life to her complex, circuitous, and picturesque language.â
âA Listâ runs Sunday, April 11, at 3 p.m., and Monday and Tuesday, April 12-13, at 7 p.m. Patrons can sign up to see the show at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow, where information is also available about the rest of the Mnemonic Theatre Festival.

Take a Tour
We're so excited for your visit! You can feel free to come by the Leffell Center for Jewish Student Life any time between 9:30 am and 4:30 pm and a student will greet you at the door and be happy to give you a tour. There is a door bell to the left of the front red doors that you can ring to enter the building. If you need to schedule a tour outside that time frame, please reach out to Hillel Assistant Director April Cunningham at AprilCunningham@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3746.

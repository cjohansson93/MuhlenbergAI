women’s basketball handles haverford


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team didn’t allow any surprise when the squad faced visiting Haverford and registered its biggest victory on the season, 72-40. 

However, outscoring the other team 



Although Muhlenberg won the game by a comfortable margin, sophomore Brenna Ferster had some uncomfortable moments. She bumped her head on the floor after taking a hard foul
midway through the second half, then hit the deck again when she took a charge with about two minutes left. Ferster was fouled again while going up with an offensive rebound
with 1:37 to play and made one of two free throws.




by a lot of points was not a must for Mules head coach Ron Rohn, who was pleased with the collective effort in that game. 

“We played very well as a team tonight,” Rohn said. “It wasn’t a question of winning by a huge margin. It was important to execute and stay focused, which, I thought, we did pretty well during the course of the game.”

After the Mules established a commanding 29-point cushion, 58-29, six minutes into the second the half, Rohn put into play some of the substitutes, who haven’t seen a lot of action this season. They didn’t let him down and maintained the comfortable lead until the final whistle. 

“They moved the ball really well,” senior Michelle Feldman said. “We want everyone to contribute to the team.”

Fourteen Muhlenberg players registered their names on the scoreboard against the Fords, with no one scoring in double figures.

“That shows that we have an unselfish team,” Rohn said.

Junior Erin McSherry pulled down team-high 10 rebounds and scored nine points in the contest. Junior Lauren Boyle notched seven points and dished out a team-leading five assists for the Mules, who recorded their sixth straight home success and improved to 7-2 in the Centennial Conference and 12-4 overall. 

Muhlenberg’s stifling defense limited Haverford to season-low 40 points and forced 22 turnovers. The Fords converted only 27.3 percent of their field goal attempts.

The Mules bounced back from a tough conference loss against Franklin & Marshall last Saturday. 

“We won an important game, which boosted our confidence,” said Feldman, who finished with seven points and four rebounds. “It was crucial to get a good win going into Thursday’s game against 
[league-leading] Dickinson.”

For decades, a Muhlenberg education has meant excellent preparation for the challenges of admission to and success in medical school. Exposure to a fine liberal arts curriculum coupled with a strong background in the natural sciences equips prehealth students with the solid foundation needed to find their place in the world.















Academic Partnerships



Muhlenberg College Partners with Temple University School of Medicine and Boston University School of Medicine for early acceptance. And has  3-4 programs with Penn Dental Medicine and SUNY College of Optometry.

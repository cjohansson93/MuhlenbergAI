Football Trips Dips for seventh win






Sophomore Cameron Ahouse (4) and senior Kevin Ciccarello (23) combine to tackle an F&M receiver late in the second quarter. The Diplomats entered the
game averaging a CC-best 236.2 yards per game, but were held to 126.



One week after breaking a long losing streak to McDaniel, the Muhlenberg football team shut out another nemesis.

Junior John DeLuca rushed for a career-high 188 

yards and two touchdowns as the 21st-ranked Mules kept their perfect record intact with a 31-0 shutout win at Franklin & Marshall. It was Muhlenberg’s first win against the Diplomats since 2003, and the Mule seniors have now defeated every other Centennial Conference team at least once.

The shutout was the fourth of the season for the Mules (7-0, 5-0), their most since the 1947 squad blanked five opponents. Since being tied with Juniata, 3-3, early in the second quarter two weeks ago, Muhlenberg has outscored its opponents 115-0.

The Mules, who have won eight in a row dating back to last season, tied a school record with their 



Junior Joe Caporoso caught four straight passes on the Mules’ last drive of the first half, setting up a field goal.




fifth straight road win, set three times previously. They return home to face defending CC champion Dickinson next weekend.

After shutting the Diplomats (1-6, 1-4) down on three plays on the first drive 

of the game, Muhlenberg drove 71 yards in 11 plays to score a touchdown on its first possession. DeLuca carried eight of the plays, including the last 5 yards.

DeLuca, who moved into fifth on the Mules’ all-time list with 1782 career yards, did most of the work on the next touchdown drive, too. He toted the ball six straight 
times, once for 37 yards, to put the ball on the 3-yard line, from where junior Erik Snyder finished up for his fourth touchdown in two weeks.

DeLuca added a 27-yard run for a score in the third quarter and was as high as 199 yards before getting stopped for losses on two carries. Sophomore Matt Boland capped the scoring with a 1-yard TD run in the third.

Franklin & Marshall had four drives end in Muhlenberg territory, advancing as far as the 29-yard line once before throwing an incomplete pass on fourth down. 
The Mule defense recorded seven sacks and 14 tackles for loss, with senior Dustin Good accounting for 1.5 sacks and 3.5 tackles for loss.

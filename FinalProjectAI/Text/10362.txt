Meet Our Faculty
Muhlenbergâs faculty personify intellectual excellence and are devoted to teaching and opening doors for each individual student. A Muhlenberg education will prepare you to apply your in- and out-of-class learning to the person you will become and the career you will create long after graduation.
Muhlenberg cultivates a shared culture that encourages and supports meaningful experimentation. Because teaching and learning are richest in an environment that fosters an exchange of perspectives, our programs provide a wide range of opportunities for collaboration among faculty and also with students, both within and across disciplines.

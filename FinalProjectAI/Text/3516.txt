WOMEN EDIT RECORD BOOK SOME MORE


The night after an emotionally charged loss to nationally ranked DeSales,
the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team figured to come out flat
against a visiting Haverford team that had lost 24 straight games to the
Mules.

Senior Gwen Doyle got Muhlenberg off to a good start, hitting a
three-pointer 15 seconds into the game. She hit another one 24 seconds
later, and that set the theme for the game. Although the Mules did
experience some sloppy play in the first half, they 





Doyle broke the previous school record of seven
three-pointers, set by Meg Malatack against Bryn Mawr in 2002, and tied
the CC mark. She has made a trey in 36 consecutive games.




were anything but flat as they wound up breaking two Division III records
and nearly breaking two others in a 133-80 win.

The Mules (6-1, 4-0 Centennial Conference) broke the Division III mark for
points in a half with 78 in the second half. The previous mark of 74 was
set by Keene State against Rivier in 1998.

Muhlenberg also made 21 three-point field goals, topping by one the
previous Division III record shared by Cabrini (vs. Rosemont, 1994) and
Emory & Henry (vs. Eastern Mennonite, 2002). The three-pointers made
record came six months after the Mules set the Division III record for
three-pointers attempted with 64, also against Haverford.

&#146Berg didn&#146t need nearly as many attempts this time, making its 21
threes in &#147only&#148 53 tries. The Mules shot 13-of-23 (56.5 percent)
from behind the arc in the second half.
<P>
Muhlenberg&#146s 133 points tied for the fourth-most ever in Division III
history, not far from the record of 140, and with 36 assists, the Mules
missed the Division III mark by two.
<P>
Only three NCAA women&#146s basketball teams, all in Division II, have
ever made more than 21 three-pointers in a game. The record of 26 was set
by Clarion in 1992.
<P>
Doyle set a school record with nine three-pointers (in 14 attempts) to
account for all of her 27 points. Junior <B>Kristen Piscadlo</B>, who set
a school record with 12 assists, added four three-pointers and finished
with 16 points for her first career double-double.
<P>
Piscadlo&#146s dozen assists overshadowed the 10 handed out by senior
<B>Aril Bryant</B>. Prior to this game, only six times in team history had
a player reached double figures in assists.
<P>
Sophomore <B>Emily Wright</B> scored 15 points and juniors <B>Sam
Tager</B> and <B>Lindsay Orosz</B> added 12 and 11, respectively, as
Muhlenberg also set school records for field goals made (50) and attempted
(120). The Mules pulled down 38 offensive rebounds, missing the school
record of 71 total rebounds by one.
<P>
Nine different Muhlenberg players hit threes and all 14 players on the
roster scored. The Mules hit the 100-point mark for the second time in
three games on a layup by junior <B>Lacie Smith</B> with 8:45 to play. The
game Fords (3-4, 0-2) played an up-tempo style throughout the contest,
taking quick shots and scoring 25 points themselves in the final eight
minutes.
<P>
Bryant&#146s only bucket of the game, on a driving layup, made the score
117-70 with 3:39 left and pushed Muhlenberg past the school record of 116
points in a game it set twice last year. Freshman <B>Michelle Feldman</B>
banked in a three-pointer from the top of the key with 2:06 to play to tie
the record of 20 in a game, and Piscadlo swished the record-breaker from
the arc with 47 seconds left.
<P>
The Mules, who set a Division III record by averaging 10.2 three-pointers
per game last year, are averaging 12.3 so far this season.

Championship Preview


Golf teams drive for titles



One Muhlenberg golf team will defend a championship and the other will try to win one at this weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships.

The Mule women’s squad, which won its second CC title last year, hosts the 36-hole CC tourney at Olde Homestead Golf Club in New Tripoli on 



Bielecki was one of only two golfers to improve her score from the first round to the second at last year’s CC Championships.




Saturday and Sunday. The men travel to The Bridges Golf Club in Abbottstown, Pa., for a three-day tournament beginning tomorrow.

The women’s team sports a different look, as only two of the five golfers who contributed 
to last year’s championship-winning effort 
will tee off this time around.

One of the two is senior Dana Lynn Bielecki, who has finished fourth at the CC Championships the last two years, tying for the best score in the second round 
last year with a career-low 86. 

Junior Hayley Cush, who shot a career-best 96 in the CC first round last year, is the other returnee. Competing for the first time in the CC Championships will be sophomore Sarah Mellick and freshmen Allison Siefert and Amy Venuto.

Gettysburg and McDaniel are the leading contenders in the 



Slocum leads the Mules and ranks ninth in the CC with a 78.5 average. He has shot in the 70s seven times in 13 rounds, with a low of 72.




five-team field, which also includes Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall.

The men have improved their standing at the CC Championships each of the last three years, from seventh in 2005 to fifth in 2006 to fourth last year. 

The Mules will try to continue that upward trend, and the statistics say they have a decent shot. They are fourth in the CC with an average of 320.6 strokes in 17 rounds but have won two of three head-to-head meetings with third-place Dickinson (319.7) and split six encounters with McDaniel (313.4). Only defending champion Franklin & Marshall (308.5) has not finished behind Muhlenberg.

“We definitely have the best team we’ve had talent-wise,” said senior captain Garrett Carpenter. “Our top five are all capable of winning a tournament. We’re going to have to shoot around 75 or 76, but we’re all capable.”

The Mules last won the CC title in 2004 and are tied with McDaniel for the most CC championships (four).

Muhlenberg has won three tournaments this year, its most since the 2000-01 campaign. After capturing two titles in the fall, the Mules got off to a slow start in the spring, finishing seventh out of 12 teams at the McDaniel Spring Invitational – which were held at The Bridges Golf Culb – and 13th out of 15 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional.

Since then, the team has done much better, including a first-place showing at the Susquehanna Invitational.

“After the winter it takes a while to get back into it.” explained Carpenter. “I think we’re all starting to play better. Now we just have to go out there and execute.”

Joining Carpenter on the Muhlenberg roster are juniors Geoffrey Kelleman and Bill Snow, sophomore Biff Slocum and freshman Zachary Oyer. Kelleman was the Mules’ low scorer at the CC event last year, placing eighth overall.

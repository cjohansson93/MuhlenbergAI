DiCecilia slugs way toplayer of the week honors 





Junior Joseph DiCecilia was named Centennial Conference co-player of the week after a remarkable stretch at the plate.

In five games  four of which came against defending NJAC champion New Jersey and defending ECAC Upstate champion St. John Fisher  DiCecilia (right) hit .545 (12-for-22) and slugged 1.091. He knocked in 10 runs, scored eight and belted six extra-base hits.

Against St. John Fisher on Friday, the first baseman became the first Mule in 56 years to hit for the cycle, going 5-for-5 with 5 RBI. DiCecilias cycle went, in order: single, triple, home run, single, double. It was just the third recorded cycle in Muhlenberg history.

DiCecilia also keyed Muhlenbergs comeback in the second game of a doubleheader against St. John Fisher the following day. He blasted a home run leading off the second inning  his team-leading third of the season  and, with the Mules trailing 5-1, brought them back into the game with a three-run triple in the seventh. Muhlenberg went on to complete the comeback and win, 10-8.

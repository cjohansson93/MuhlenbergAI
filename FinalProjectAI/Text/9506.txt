Have you caught Golf Cart Pedagogy, the Muhlenberg College take on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee? If you have, you'll notice the biggest difference: Instead of comic Jerry Seinfeld in a classy, vintage car, itâs Digital Cultures Technologist and Media & Communications Adjunct Professor Tony Dalton in a dependable golf cart. 

The idea for this mode of campus communication took off in August 2018 as Dalton and Tom Sciarrino, director of instructional technology & digital learning, carpooled to the Digital Pedagogy Lab at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. They wanted a fun way to engage the College community that would also explore and celebrate how faculty, staff and students use technology in their teaching and learning.
âIt seemed like the strangest, silliest thing imaginable,â Dalton says about driving around campus at super-slow speeds while conversing about pedagogy and technology. âBut visually this is more interesting than two talking heads, and there is no way you can take it too seriously.â 
Since its launch in April, Golf Cart Pedagogy has become an episodic adventure rolling through Muhlenbergâs campus. In August, the series won a Communications Award from SIGUCCS, a higher education IT organization.
The series began as a natural extension of what Dalton and Sciarrino do on campus. They believe their roles are less as technologists and more as facilitators, helping to connect people with ideasâand they want to give a platform to those who may not always be the first to voice their opinions online or on campus. A new segment is posted each month and interviews are already scheduled through the spring.
From the first episode featuring Tineke DâHaeseleer, assistant professor of history to a conversation with Eric Bond, master plumber in plant operations and a current Wescoe student to Professor of Chemistry Keri Colabroy talking about her humanizing philosophy of "chemistry for everyone," the series extols the idea that everyone has a story to share. 
The humble but reliable golf cartâutilized by many departments on campus, including plant operations, dining services and housekeepingâseemed like the perfect vehicle to serve up these conversations. Dalton says, âThe carts are such a ubiquitous part of Muhlenberg life.â
Dalton, who hosts and edits each segment, inserts humor throughout the interviews and says getting hyper-edited sound bites and one-liners isnât the priority. Rather, heâs aiming for a natural conversation that allows the interviewee to deem whatâs important about their story and whatâs not. 
Sciarrino and Dalton are quick to give credit for the success of the project to the entire media services and instructional technology team. âThe entire crew, weâre all working together on thisâcoming up with ideas, suggesting people to interview, shooting the video,â says Sciarrino. âEvery episode has been more fun than the last.â

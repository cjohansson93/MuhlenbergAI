Edward Lenzo â
Visiting Assistant Professor




BackgroundB.A.: Rutgers UniversityM.A.: Colorado State UniversityPh.D.: University of Memphis
Professor Lenzo joined Muhlenberg College as a Visiting Assistant Professor in 2021. He completed his B.A. at Rutgers University and his M.A., on the topic of the phenomenology of the self, at Colorado State University. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Memphis in the Spring of 2021, writing a dissertation that critically combined phenomenological psychopathology with the ethical metaphysics of Emmanuel Levinas.
At Muhlenberg, Professor Lenzo teaches courses on the Philosophy of Mind, Biomedical Ethics, Being & Knowing, and Phenomenology, as well as courses on special topics such as Empathy. At Colorado State University, Front Range Community College, the University of Memphis, and Southwest Tennessee Community College he has taught courses on Logic and Critical Thinking, Introduction to Philosophy, Introduction to Ethics, and the Self.
Professor Lenzoâs research interests include the problem of other minds and the question of intersubjectivity. Specifically, he is interested in how human beings relate to one another (and to non-humans), especially across apparent difference. His published and presented works include âIntrinsic Temporality in Depression: Classical phenomenological psychiatry, affectivity, and narrativeâ (Cambridge University Press), âMimicry and Normativityâ (Cambridge University Press), âThe Corporate Problem of Moral Luckâ (International Social Ontology Conference), and âWe Can Dance (if we want to): Clearing the Dance Floor and Ahmedâs Queer Politicsâ (The Phenomenology Roundtable).
Areas of Specialization:
Philosophy of Mind (construed broadly) and Continental Philosophy (esp. Husserl and Levinas)
Areas of Competence:
Ethics (incl. Biomedical), Logic & Critical Thinking, Modern Philosophy

Common Questions
At Muhlenberg, we welcome questions and we look forward to getting to know you.

          Where is Muhlenberg?
  








Muhlenberg's beautiful campus is nestled in the West End neighborhood of Allentown, PA, in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, about an hour north of Philadelphia and an hour and a half west of New York City. The campus sits on about 82 acres, and we also maintain a 60-acre arboretum and a 40-acre environmental field station/wildlife sanctuary. Allentown is Pennsylvania's third largest city, and the Lehigh Valley has attracted a number of corporations, dining establishments and entertainment outlets in recent years. Learn more about our region






          What are the current expenses for tuition, room, board, and fees?
  








For the 2021-2022 school year, tuition & fees are $55,830; room & board are $11,640. More about costs can be found here.






          What types of financial aid are available?
  








The primary component of a student's financial aid package is the Muhlenberg College Grant, which does not need to be paid back and is renewable for four years based on academic progress and family financial circumstances. In addition, the Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, Pell Grant, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant are all available based on family need. Entering first-year students are eligible for Merit Scholarships in amounts ranging up to $30,000 per year. In addition, the four honors programs each carry $5,000 annual awards, and performing and fine arts talent grants are awarded on the basis of an audition or submitted portfolio. Get more details about our grants and awards on our Merit Scholarship page.






          What kinds of tests are required for admission?
  








If you submit test scores, we ask for the SAT or ACT. Since 1996, Muhlenberg has offered prospective first-year students the option of not submitting their SAT or ACT scores. We also honor AP and IB credit. One final note, if youâre applying for an academic partnership program, you must submit test scores.






          Are interviews required? 
  








Interviews are highly recommended for all students, and required for students applying for one of our academic partnerships. Please make advance reservations for interviews and tours by visiting here or by calling 484-664-3200.






          Can I sit in on a class?
  








Yes. If you’re a high school senior, you have two options: scheduling a day visit, which is hosted by a current student and may include sitting in on one or two classes and eating in the student dining room; or simply sitting in on a class. We ask for at least two weeks' advance notice for both options. More about visit options






          What is social life like? 
  








Busy! There are over 100 student organizations on campus, from six a capella singing groups to theater, dance and improv; from intramurals to community service; and from environmental action to writing, polling and political activism. There are also five sororities and three fraternities. And if you don’t find what you are looking for, you can start it yourself!






          Does the College honor AP credit?
  








Students who take an Advanced Placement class in high school and who score a 4 or 5 on their AP examination may earn a course unit (one course) toward graduation from Muhlenberg.  Muhlenberg also offers credit for International Baccalaureate (IB) testing.  






          Are there honors programs?
  








Yes, incoming first-year students may be invited to join one of four honors programs: Dana Scholars, RJ Fellows, Muhlenberg Scholars and Shankweiler Scholars. Muhlenberg also houses a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and several other academic honor societies.






          Is there academic support available if I have difficulty with my classes?
  








Yes. The Academic Resource Center offers a range of services, including workshops on study skills as well as specific academic subjects, and peer tutoring.






          What is the diversity like on campus? 
  








In recent years, approximately 21% of Muhlenberg students are of Black or African-American, Asian, Hispanic or Native American descent. Several organizations support multicultural life on campus. In addition, Muhlenberg enjoys unusual religious diversity, with approximately one third Catholic students, one third Jewish students, and just over 20% Protestant students. Organizations such as an active Hillel, the Newman Association, and the Lutheran Student Movement support religious life on campus. See Berg at a glance.






          What are my housing options?
  








Campus housing is guaranteed all four years. First-year students may live in one of three dorms: Prosser Hall, Walz Hall, or Brown Hall (female only). Roommates are matched based on basic living and studying habits which students indicate on their housing preference card. Visit the Office of Residential Services.

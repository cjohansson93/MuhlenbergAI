Torphy is hoping for his second trip to nationals this year; he qualified in indoor track and earned All-America honors with the distance medley relay team in March.



torphy awaits wordon cross country nationals


Junior Bobby Torphy of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team put himself in a position to run in the NCAA Championships by finishing 22nd at the NCAA Mideast
Regional, hosted by Muhlenberg at Lehigh. 

Torphy earned all-region honors for his 22nd-place finish. He was 13th among runners not from the two teams (Allegheny and Carnegie Mellon) that automatically qualified
for the NCAA Championships. If the NCAA awards at-large bids to third-place Haverford and fourth-place Dickinson, Torphy would move up to sixth among runners from
non-qualifying teams. The top seven in each region receive invitations to the national meet. The at-large bids will be announced on Sunday afternoon.

Torphy led the Mule men’s team to a 15th-place finish out of 45 complete teams. 

The Muhlenberg women, competing without their best runner, came in 25th out of 44. Sophomore Melissa Ugelow paced the Mules with a 46th-place showing in a field of 311.

The women’s race was dominated by Centennial Conference teams, as Johns Hopkins and Dickinson finished 1-2 to earn the automatic bids and Haverford (third) and 
Gettysburg (fifth) also were in the top five.

Muhlenberg split with Moravian at the meet. Combined with the football win, the Mules have a 5-2 lead in the Matte Award standings heading into the winter season.

Muha Breaks Hits Records as Baseball Wins Big
 Friday, April 26, 2013







					 


John Muha bats at the top of the order, and now he’s on top of the hits list.




Muha has 21 multiple-hit games this season and leads the CC with a .517 on-base percentage.



The senior outfielder became the Muhlenberg baseball program’s all-time leader in hits when he singled leading off the bottom of the first against Dickinson, breaking the tie he had held with Joshua Carter (1999-2002) since Tuesday.

Muha later added another single, finishing the game with 190 career hits, to help the Mules complete a season sweep of the Red Devils with a 23-6 win.

“That was one of my personal goals at the start of the season,” said Muha, who is tied for 10th in Centennial Conference history with his 190 hits. “I’m pretty happy that I achieved it.”

Muha lined a 3-1 pitch over the head of the shortstop for the record-breaking hit as the Muhlenberg bench erupted in cheers. The single set the stage for a seven-run first inning, which ultimately led to the Mules (19-17, 7-9) reaching the 20-run mark for the second time this season.




Cush came in with the bases loaded in the fifth and retired two of the three hitters he faced to earn his second win of the season.



“When we first started out, I was just ‘see the ball, hit the ball.’ Then the ball started looking like a beach ball,” said Muha, the CC’s leading hitter with a .437 average. “From there I was able to stay hot throughout the season.”

The Muhlenberg bats stayed hot throughout the game, pounding out 18 hits, including five doubles that gave the Mules a school-record 79 two-baggers on the season. The Mules also took advantage of nine errors by the Red Devils (13-24, 3-13) to score at least four runs in four of the first six innings, including two frames of seven runs.

Senior Joseph Vila, who is pursuing a career record of his own, drove in the first runs with a two-run single up the middle and finished 4-for-6 with four runs scored and three RBI. With 109 career RBI, he is four short of tying the school record.

Junior Nick Kennedy was 3-for-5, and sophomores Kurt Johnson and Conor McDermott and freshman Andrew Rava all drove in three runs. Every Mule starter scored at least one run and drove in at least one.

Relievers Austin Cush, Phillip Balseca and Andrew Oakes combined to allow only one run while striking out eight over the final 4 2/3 innings.

The win gave Muhlenberg its first season sweep of a CC foe in two years and put the team in a position to achieve two significant benchmarks as it wraps up CC play with a doubleheader against first-place Johns Hopkins tomorrow.

“If we play really well we could finish at .500 in the conference and get to 20 wins in a season,” said Muha.

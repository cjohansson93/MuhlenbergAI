boyle repeats on all-cc first team





Boyle has been named CC player of the week twice this season.


For the second consecutive year, junior guard Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was selected to the All-Centennial Conference first team.

Boyle led a contigent of three Mules earning conference recognition; junior center Erin McSherry and freshman point guard Kelly McKeon received honorable mention.

Boyle ranks in the top 10 in the CC in scoring (sixth at 14.8 points per game), assists (seventh at 3.48 per game), free-throw percentage (third at .767) and assist-to-
turnover ratio (second at 1.55). She leads Muhlenberg in scoring, is second in assists and steals, tied for second in blocked shots and tied for fourth in rebounding.

Only the second Mule women’s basketball player to earn first-team CC honors twice, Boyle has scored in double figures in 19 of 25 games, with seven outings
of 20 points or more. She has led the team in scoring 11 times and went over the 1,000 point mark in a win against Johns Hopkins. On the program’s career list,
she is fifth in scoring (1,036 points), fourth in field goals (420) and 11th in assists (190).

McSherry made the all-conference squad for the first time. She is averaging a 7.4 points and a team-best 6.2 rebounds and leads the CC with 47 blocked shots. McKeon leads
the CC and all Division III freshmen in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.80). She also paces Muhlenberg in steals (42) and is second in scoring average (10.2 points per game).

This is the first time since 2004 that three Mules have earned All-CC honors. The all-star trio has led the team to a 19-6 overall record, a ranking of No. 6 in the Middle
Atlantic Region and a tie for first place in the Centennial. Muhlenberg will travel to Franklin & Marshall for the CC playoffs this weekend, beginning with a semifinal
matchup with Dickinson on Saturday.

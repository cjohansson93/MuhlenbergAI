Men's Soccer Hops Past Washington
 Saturday, October 6, 2012 - page 3







					 



Late in the first half of Muhlenberg’s men’s soccer game against Washington, a rabbit bounded across the field in front of the team benches.

“That’s our third striker,” quipped Mule head coach Sean Topping.



All kidding aside, Muhlenberg does have a player with the speed of a rabbit (although his nickname suggests quite the opposite), and his quick strike helped the Mules to an important 2-1 win against the Shoremen.

Junior Jeff Reinhart, called “Rhino” by his teammates, scored a goal just 3:56 into the game after receiving a pass on the right wing from senior Cody Antonini, taking a couple of touches and driving a shot on the ground inside the far post.

“It’s about time,” Reinhart said of his first career goal. “I’ve been waiting for it.”

Reinhart did more than wait after last season – he joined the Muhlenberg track and field team during the winter and won a gold medal as a member of the 4x200 relay team at the Centennial Conference Championships.

“[Running track] definitely made me faster and improved my confidence,” said Reinhart, whose bid for a second goal in the second half was thwarted by a great point-blank save by the Shoremen keeper. “It’s fun to burn those outside backs.”

Reinhart’s early goal was equalized by a Washington score, but with 16:01 left in the half, the Mules (7-3, 3-2) went back on top for good. Again Antonini was involved, beating a defender to the endline in the box and passing the ball back to junior Jacob Joseph (left) for the close-range putaway.

Although Muhlenberg didn’t score again, it controlled play for most of the second half – outshooting the Shoremen by an 11-2 margin – and came away with a much-needed win after suffering back-to-back CC losses to Swarthmore and Haverford last week.

“We talked about it afterwards and said that everybody loses, and you can’t take it to heart,” said Reinhart. “Last year we lost some games and it affected the way we played. Tonight it showed that we bounced back from those games and played the way we can.”

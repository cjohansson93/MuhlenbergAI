Mission Statement
The mission of the Accounting Program at Muhlenberg College is to develop knowledgeable, independent critical thinkers, who are prepared to make intellectual contributions and are able to express ideas with clarity and grace.   The accounting program cultivates liberally educated professionals committed to life-long learning and service who hold themselves to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity.  The curriculum fosters learning within and beyond the classroom, an appreciation for global interdependence, and endeavors to equip students with the ability to formulate and solve problems and to make effective decisions.  Based on the expectation that students assume increasing responsibility for themselves and others, we offer experiences for developing interpersonal and leadership skills.  Our faculty members are passionate about teaching, value close relationships with students, and are committed to working with alumni, accounting professionals and others in the financial business community.

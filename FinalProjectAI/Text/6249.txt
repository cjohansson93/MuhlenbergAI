Men's Tennis Outlasts McDaniel for First Win of Spring

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team kept the good streak and ditched the bad one.

After opening the spring with seven straight losses, the Mules broke into the winning column with a 7-2 victory at McDaniel. It was the 29th straight win for Muhlenberg
against the Green Terror – a streak dating back to 1982.

The Mules swept the doubles matches in a Centennial Conference contest for the first time in almost two years. Muhlenberg’s second singles win, which clinched the match,
came in dramatic fashion as sophomore Jason Teitelbaum came back from a 5-1 deficit in the first set to win 7-5. He then went on to capture the second
set, 6-2.

Senior Jordan Rutt (right) lost only three games in winning at No. 1 doubles (with Teitelbaum) and No. 1 singles. Freshman Eric Chavis
also won at both doubles and singles.

baseball wins rare low-scoring game


“Normal” baseball made a brief appearance at Cedarcreek Field for the first game of the 



Daniels struck out three and did not walk a batter after the first inning in picking up his first career win.



Muhlenberg baseball team’s doubleheader against Elizabethtown.

After opening the northern part of their schedule with 
seven home games in which the winning team scored an average of 14.1 runs, the Mules rode the pitching of freshmen Jason Daniels and Spencer Joseph to a tidy 4-1 victory. 

The big bats returned for the second game, as the two-time defending Commonwealth Conference champion Blue Jays outscored the hosts 18-11 to gain the split.

Daniels and Joseph combined on a two-hitter in the opener. Daniels got off to a shaky start, hitting the first batter and walking the next two. But he got out of the jam with only one run scoring and blanked Elizabethtown (9-6) the rest of his six-inning stint, retiring 11 of the last 13 batters he faced.

Joseph worked a 1-2-3 seventh to earn his first career save.

Muhlenberg (9-8) took advantage of two walks and a throwing error to score two runs in the first on a sacrifice fly by junior Edward Risener and a two-out RBI single by junior John Kalis.

In the second, sophomore Eric Pomroy doubled in a pair of runners, including senior Joe Carlo, who reached with one of his three singles.

That was all the scoring in the first game, but not for the day. The teams combined for 29 runs, 33 hits and five home runs in the nightcap. The Mules hit two of the long balls, three-run shots off the bats of Risener in the third and Pomroy in the eighth – the first career round-tripper for both. Risener finished 4-for-5 in the game.

The games were the last tuneups for Centennial Conference play for the Mules, who have their league opener slated for tomorrow at Haverford. Muhlenberg has already matched its win total from all of last year, with two of the victories coming against teams that played in the 2007 NCAA Tournament .

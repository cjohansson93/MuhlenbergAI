Bauer Improves Best Mark at TCNJ Last Chance
 Thursday, May 17, 2012







					 



Freshman Tyler Bauer, the lone member of the Muhlenberg track and field teams to compete at TCNJ’s Lions’ Last Chance, took advantage
of his last chance.

Bauer placed sixth in the javelin, throwing 190-4 to improve on his previous personal best of 188-8 and move closer to the school record of 196-7.

As of the latest NCAA performance list, Bauer ranked 40th in Division III in the javelin (seventh among freshmen). The new mark will move him up a little but may not be enough to earn him
a spot in the NCAA Championships. Bids for the national meet will be announced on Sunday.

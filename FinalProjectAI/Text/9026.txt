Economics and Finance Mission Statement
The mission of the Economics and Finance Programs at Muhlenberg College is to provide a rigorous course of study in the methods and perspectives of economics and finance for the purpose of developing independent and critical thinkers, equipped with ethical values who are able to express ideas with clarity and grace. We integrate the very best traditions of the liberal arts with pre-professional studies, nurturing the intellectual agility necessary for success in a dynamic world. Our faculty members are passionate about teaching, value close relationships with students, and are committed to the importance of professional activity and research.

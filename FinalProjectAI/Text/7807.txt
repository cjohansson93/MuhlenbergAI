Field Hockey Rolls into Conference Play with Shutout Win

Muhlenberg field hockey is ready for the Centennial Conference. 

The Mules sealed their fourth win in a row heading into Friday’s conference opener at McDaniel by beating King’s, 3-0, and it was the usual suspects involved in the scoring. 

Seniors Kayleigh Thies and Lauren Jordan scored for the second game in a row, while sophomore Emily Boyle knocked one in for the fourth straight game. 

Senior Sierra Lenker (right) posted her second shutout of the season, making four saves, and has now given up only three goals in five games.

Thies started the scoring in the 14th minute the same way she scored against Drew, off of a corner from classmate Samantha Swire and put into the back of the cage. 

The Mules (4-1) took that lead into halftime and added to it quickly out of the break. Jordan notched her team-best fourth goal of the season a little over three minutes into the second frame. Boyle kept pace with Jordan by putting in the fourth of her own in the 52nd minute to seal the game.

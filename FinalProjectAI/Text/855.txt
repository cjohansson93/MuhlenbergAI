East Hall Renovations and Live Webcam


East Hall, built in 1903 and one of the College's first buildings, is undergoing significant renovations and getting a major addition.


	 Friday, June 7, 2013  11:15 AM

Construction Update: Tuesday, June 11 -  The large cranes will start putting the East Hall addition in place today.
Tune into our webcams with West, North and 23rd & Gordon views to see the progress live!
As a four year, residential liberal arts institution, Muhlenberg College houses approximately 90% of our students in a variety of student housing options. From traditional residence halls, to Greek houses, to suite/apartment style buildings, to houses surrounding the main campus- Muhlenberg offers an array of housing choices that can suit students’ different preferences, needs, and expectations. East Hall is the oldest residence hall on campus and holds a rich history as well as an aesthetic quality that enhances the overall appearance of the campus.
East Hall is a unique building with its own character. Our renovation takes this character into account while updating the building to meet the modern needs and expectations of students. The project will be completed in August 2014. 
To view more information about the East Hall renovation project, please visit our construction site.

Brewer repeats as player of the year,wenzel named to softball second team





Blohm, Brewer earn weekly conference awards


To the victors go the spoils for the Muhlenberg softball team.

After going 3-0 during the playoffs to win the Centennial Conference Championship, senior Ashley Brewer and junior Brittany Blohm were named the conference's pitcher and player of the week, respectively.

Blohm (below) earned player of the week accolades for the first time in her career after batting .500 with two doubles and four RBI last week.

She drove in the winning run with two outs in the seventh against Dickinson to give the Mules the conference title. She also smacked a two-run double in the first playoff game against Washington.

Brewer was named co-pitcher of the week after she went 4-0 on the week, including all three wins in the conference tournament. On the opening day of the playoffs she started two games on the same day for the first time in her career, beating Washington, 8-4, and picking up the 11th shutout of her career, 1-0, over Dickinson. 








Fresh off winning a record-tying fifth Centennial Conference Championship, two members of the Muhlenberg softball team were honored by the conference.

Senior Ashley Brewer was named the CC player of the year for the second season in a row; she was also named to the first team as a utility player. Freshman Erica Wenzel joined Brewer on the All-CC squad, being named to the second-team at second base.

Brewer (top right) is only the second Mule athlete to be named player of the year in the same sport in back-to-back seasons since Muhlenberg joined the Centennial Conference. She is just one of five athletes in school history to earn a pair of player of the year awards.

She currently ranks sixth in the conference in batting and fourth in ERA. Brewer leads the CC in RBI and is tied for the most home runs and wins.

The Mules pitcher/first baseman/designated player has spent the season assaulting the Mule record book. Her seven home runs this year have not only broken the schools single-season record, but the career mark as well. Her 13 career round-trippers are more than double the old record of six. 

Brewer's 47 RBI have bettered the previous mark by 11, and her 35 runs scored would be the school record if it hadnt already been broken by two of her teammates this season. She also ranks second in extra-base hits (19) and third in hits (53) in a season.

For her career, Brewer ranks third on Muhlenbergs hits, runs and stolen base lists and is second in extra-base hits and RBI, in addition to being the career home run leader. 

Wenzel (bottom right) earned second-team honors thanks to a very impressive debut season for the Mules. She has already broken the school record for runs scored in a season (40) and is tied for third on the team with 35 hits and nine doubles.

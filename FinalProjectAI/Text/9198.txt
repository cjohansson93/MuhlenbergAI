The Latin American & Caribbean Studies minor is an interdisciplinary study of the history, literature, cultures and languages across this region. Our principle goals are to foster a comprehensive understanding of the human experience and an appreciation of the complex past and contemporary issues and to encourage proficiency through the study of language and literature on campus and abroad.

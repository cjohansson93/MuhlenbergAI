Collaboration Technology





Collaboration Room
The Collaboration Room is a workspace where patrons are able to gather and work together on joint tasks. The room has a table with both HDMI and VGA cables that can be plugged into a computer and then cast onto the wall monitor. The technology is designed to display one computer to the monitor at the time, but can easily switch between up to four computers. In addition to collaborative technology, this space also is equipped with a wall whiteboard. The Collaboration Room is a perfect solution when determining where to do group work. Schedule time to use the Collaboration Room
Collaboration Stations
The Collaboration Stations are mobile units that are designed to turn any space in Trexler Library into a collaborative one. These stations are large flat screen monitors on a mobile stand that are powered by Apple Mac Mini computers. Patrons can share their individual screens via HDMI cord, the Mirroring360 Chrome extension, or AirPlay. Please see the Collaboration Station guide for the full range of uses and instructions for our Collaboration Stations.

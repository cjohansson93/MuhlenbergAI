This past year, Michael Silverstein '18 faced a tough situation: His father had a polyp in his colon that doctors feared was precancerous. As his family awaited test results, his father began weighing the treatment options he could pursue if the news was bad. Thankfully, it wasnâtâbut the ordeal got Michael, a psychology major, thinking about the fraught process of making a decision when your own health is on the line.
âThereâs a lot of literature on doctorsâ decision making, but not a lot on patientsâ,â Michael says. âI got really interested in peopleâs willingness to undergo treatment.â
Michael had planned to do summer research regardlessâhe hopes to pursue his Ph.D. after graduationâand this experience inspired his topic: how individuals make medical decisions. With help from his academic advisor, Jeff Rudski, professor and chair of the psychology department, and his summer research advisor, Laura Edelman, professor of psychology, he designed an experiment.
The project looked at subjectsâ willingness to take corticosteroids, a class of drug meant to suppress inflammation that, like most drugs, may cause unpleasant side effects. Michael varied the amount of background information subjects received on the drug, then either shared with them a positive anecdote about the drugâs effects, a negative one or no anecdote at all. Subjects then were given results-related âbase rates:â One set painted the drugâs effects in a positive light, while the other skewed more negative. The subjects who heard the positive anecdote trusted it more than the negative base rates, while those who heard the negative anecdote were more likely to also trust the negative base rates.
âThe anecdotal evidence represented one person and thus one data point, while the base rate information represented, as far as the participants knew, 298 people,â Michael says. âIt is interesting how one data point, when given as a story, can change how much people view the other data's meaning and incorporate it into their decisions.â
Research like Michaelâs helps us learn how to help people become better consumers of medical information, Edelman says. âWhen youâre watching TV and an ad comes on with a pretty, happy person saying, âI had this horrible thing and now Iâm all betterââthat has a huge impact on decision making,â she says.
Plus, every choice a person can make about their health has benefits and drawbacks, and whether something is considered good or bad for you can change from source to source and week to week. âMedical decision making is very complex but very important to understand because people are making decisions that are going to have huge impacts on their lives,â she adds.
Michael will continue related research for his senior thesis as he begins applying to Ph.D. programs. âI can have conversations with professionals in the field about factors that affect medical decision making, and itâs really useful for the interview process Iâm going to have to go through,â Michael says. âBecause Muhlenberg is solely undergrad, it gives undergraduates the opportunity to do research that grad students would be doing at larger institutions. You canât put a price tag on that experience.â

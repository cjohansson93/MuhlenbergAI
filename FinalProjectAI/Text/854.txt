His talk, “Adam Smith’s Moral Philosophy,” is free and open to the public.
Evensky received his Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 1984.  He is the author of Adam Smith’s Moral Philosophy: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective on Markets, Law, Ethics, and Culture (2005), Economics: Ideas and Issues for a Sustainable World (2007) and numerous scholarly publications.  He serves on the editorial board of The Journal of the History of Economic Thought and, from 1997 to 2000, served on the Executive Committee of the History of Economics Society.  Evensky’s research interests include the economic philosopher Adam Smith, ethics and liberal society, the history of economic thought, labor economics and economics education.
Market Values is co-directed by Sue Curry Jansen, professor of media and communications, Mohsin Hashim, associate professor of political science, and Marcia Morgan, assistant professor of philosophy.  The goal of the Center for Ethics’ programming is to engage the community in intensive and reflective thinking about individual and collective values.

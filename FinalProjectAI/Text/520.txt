Careers in Biochemistry (What Can I Do With Biochemistry?)

Many Biochemistry majors continue their training and choose a career in the health professions. For more information about programs including entrance requirements, see the Health Professions webpage.
Biochemistry students also choose careers in research both in industrial settings and in academia. Pharmaceutical companies may offer summer internships and also recruit on campus through the Career Center . Many students also choose to continue their studies and apply to graduate schools; you may wish to seek advice from faculty members as you explore this option.
There are certainly many other possible career options for a student majoring in Biochemistry within a liberal arts context. Please feel free to speak with faculty members regarding your interests, possible careers, and course requirements that may need to be met for those goals.

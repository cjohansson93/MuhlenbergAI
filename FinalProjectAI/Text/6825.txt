Women's Lacrosse Dethrones King's
 Wednesday, March 27, 2013 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team made sure that Monarchs have no reign within Scotty Wood Stadium.

After a loss to No. 8 Franklin & Marshall halted the Mules’ winning streak at four, the team went quickly back to its winning ways with an 18-10 victory over King’s.




Franck led the defensive effort with five caused turnovers and now has 82 for her career, good for second place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.



The Lady Monarchs (3-6) scored first, about 90 seconds into the game, but freshman Casey Armstrong evened things up with a goal at the 27:09 mark.

Then the trio of Molly Davin, Michelle Certosimo and Stephanie Umbach led an offensive assault of five goals in just under five minutes to give the Mules (5-2) a 6-1 lead with 26:46 remaining until halftime. Umbach netted three goals, Davin had two and Certosimo assisted on two.

Although the three have no overlap in class years – Davin is a senior, Certosimo a junior and Umbach a sophomore – they have led the Muhlenberg offense all season long, and today was no exception.

They combined for 11 of Muhlenberg’s 18 goals  – Umbach had six, Davin four and Certosimo one. Certosimo dished out seven assists, just one short of tying the school record for assists in a game, set back in 2006. 




Pedersen’s first career goal gave the Mules a 12-6 lead with 15:36 left in the game.



For the year, Umbach has a team-high 36 points on 29 goals, Davin has 33 points on 25 goals, and Certosimo has 30 points on 20 assists. Just shy of the halfway point in the season, her 20-assist mark is nine short of tying her personal best of 29, set last season, which ranks fourth on Muhlenberg’s single season list.

“I know Michelle and I work great together,” said Umbach of her teammate. “She always keeps her head up and when she sees someone, she passes the ball – she doesn’t second guess it no matter who it is out on the field. She trusts everyone and she always has a good, positive attitude.”

Armstrong added another goal before the half and Umbach scored a pair to give the Mules a 9-5 edge at the break. Armstrong has tallied 16 points this season on eight goals and eight assists. 

Fellow freshman Arielle Sherman opened the scoring for Muhlenberg in the second half, notching her fourth goal of the season. Classmates Callie Brown, Rachel Pederson and Brigid Noone also scored as the half progressed.

“It’s always different at the beginning of the season when you have new girls on the team, but the freshmen really did their part,” said Umbach of this year’s new class. “They weren’t afraid to go to goal and they weren’t afraid to get the ball. They definitely stepped up a lot. They know their roles on the field and they embrace those roles and I’m really looking forward to having them around for two more years.”

Senior Ali Gabriele also added a goal, her fifth of the season, and junior Ally Shaffer and senior Alexandra Franck each added an assist. It was Franck’s second career assist and it came on a long pass to Certosimo following an interception. 

Umbach tallied nine draw controls and, along with freshman Amanda Orlak, added four ground balls.

The Mules held a 43-32 shot advantage over the Lady Monarchs. Senior Tiffany Kreider and freshman Kiersten Mulvey combined to make 11 saves.

“We definitely had our heads up today,” added Umbach. “With Franklin & Marshall, we kind of got our heads down. We were all cheering each other on today for every little thing each one of us did. I know that after this game, our heads are up, we’ve brushed off the loss to F&M and we’re getting ready for Gettysburg on Friday.”

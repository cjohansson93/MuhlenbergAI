Field Hockey Comes Up Big to Win Opener

Just a year and a game into her career, sophomore Kayleigh Thies has already established herself as a “big-time” player.

That’s “big” as in the big spaces on the turf when Muhlenberg field hockey games go into overtime and the teams compete with only six field players.
Thies scored her second goal in as many chances to give the Mules a season-opening 2-1 win against Scranton.




Junior Ashley DeAngelis made a defensive save late in the first half to keep the Royals off the board.




“I have full confidence in us when we go into overtime, because we can play a big ball game,” said Thies. “We’re very good with a big ball game.”

The winning goal came just 57 seconds into the extra period, and it was a result of a big ball. Junior Dayna Hovern sent a long pass from the left
side into the circle in the direction of Thies, who was sprinting down the right side. The Scranton goalie came out to intercept the pass, but couldn’t
knock it away. Thies collected the ball and fired it into the left side of the cage.

Thies’ first overtime winner, against Drew last year, also gave Muhlenberg its first win of the season. But that was in the fourth game of the year. This win
was the first for the Mules in a season opener since 2007.

“We all came back for this season in very good shape,” said Thies. “Everyone was pumped to start the season on a new note.”

Aiding the cause were three sophomores who didn’t see much action last year. Lauren Jordan came off the bench to score her first career goal
early in the second half, Samantha Swire made her first career start and put pressure on the goalie to win a penalty stroke in the second half, and
Ray Gallagher played the entire regulation as a back in her first career start.

“They were kind of hidden behind upperclassmen last year but worked super hard over the summer to prove themselves,” said Thies. “It’s great
to have new people step into the positions of the players who graduated.”

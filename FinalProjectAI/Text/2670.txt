men’s 4x800 wins ecac



Muhlenberg junior Stuart Udis (right) set two school records, provisionally qualified for the NCAA Championships and earned a gold medal at the ECAC Indoor
Track & Field Championships, hosted by Harvard at the Reggie Lewis Center.

Udis was part of the 4x800-meter relay team (along with junior David Chorney, sophomore Patrick Thornton and freshman Bobby Torphy) that 
took first place with a school-record time of 7:52.52, a full three seconds better than the mark set in 2005. The winning
performance marked the fourth time in the last six years that a Mule men’s relay team won a gold medal at the ECAC indoor meet. 

Udis also broke the school record in the 800, finishing fourth in 1:53.41 and knocking his event coach, Will Elson ’03, out of the record book. The time qualified
Udis provisionally for the NCAA Championships. On Monday, Udis and Muhlenberg’s other qualifier, sophomore pole vaulter Alex Faust, will find out if they have
made the field for the national meet. Faust tied for third in the pole vault (11-¾) at the ECAC Championships but did not improve her standing on the NCAA list.

Junior Timothy Van Syckle also broke a school record at the ECACs, running the 5,000 in 15:16.62 to chop almost nine seconds off the previous mark. Chorney came
within a second of the school record in the mile, running 4:17.74 to finish seventh.

The Mule men’s team finished 19th out of 58 schools that scored points.

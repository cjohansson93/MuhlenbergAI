Women’s soccer finds pot of gold 



The forecast called for rain for tonight’s Muhlenberg women’s soccer game. But before the rain fell, a giant rainbow overlooked the field early in the first half, distracting fans and players alike.

“I probably shouldn’t have been looking at the rainbow while I was playing, but it was actually really cool,” said senior Kasey Hacker. “A lot of the girls on the bench said it was hard to pay attention to the game while it was there.”

It shouldn’t have been, though, because as one phenomenon overtook the sky another was happening on the field. Hacker connected on two goals in the game’s first 12 minutes, both assisted by her twin sister Kimberly Hacker, to give the Mules a commanding early lead.

Then, as the sky opened up and the rain came down, a flood of Muhlenberg goals came with it. The Mules scored one more time in the first half and three

more times in the second half en route to a 6-0 victory over DeSales.

“I think we were frustrated after only scoring one goal in our first two games of the year,” said Hacker. “Tonight let us know that we can score, and if we keep shooting good things will happen.”

The Mules’ third goal came when Hacker found sophomore Nicolette Miller wide open in front, and Miller’s shot deflected off junior Valerie Patriarca and into the net.

The sister act continued in the second half, as sophomore Meghan O’Grady and senior Christina O’Grady each tallied a goal. Junior Lauren Petri scored her second goal of the season on a fantastic move, knocking the ball over a defender to herself and burying a shot into the far corner.

Sophomore Michele Toher recorded the shutout in net, making five saves and picking up her first win of the year.

The Mules have now won straight after dropping their season opener and will look to build on their winning streak, beginning tomorrow night against Penn State Altoona.

“It’s really important to get a streak going,” Hacker said. “We’ve gotten a lot of confidence with these two wins, and hopefully we’ll get another tomorrow.”

Football Storms Past Dickinson, 61-21
 Saturday, October 27, 2012 - page 3







					 


It was a perfect storm.

Hurricane Dan D, an aggressive front and a Winter-y kick were just some of the factors that contributed to one of the most impressive offensive performances by the Muhlenberg football team in a decade.

Senior Dan Deighan threw for a career-high 313 yards and two touchdowns to lead a 591-yard outburst as the Mules rolled to a 61-21 win at Dickinson.




Senior James Jurewicz carried the ball from scrimmage for the first time in his career and rushed for 51 yards on nine carries.



The 61 points were the most scored by the Mules since a 68-22 win against Franklin & Marshall in 2002 and the most in a road game since a 63-13 thumping of Hartwick the previous year. In the last 43 years, they only reached the 60-point mark one other time, in a 60-14 win at Swarthmore in 1997.

It was quite the difference from Muhlenberg’s last road game, a 17-0 loss at Susquehanna four weeks ago that snapped a long streak of not getting shut out in the regular season.


“It feels like a month since we’ve traveled, and this win felt great because the last time we were on the road was not a good weekend for us,” said Deighan, who also ran for a touchdown. “So it was good for us to punch back.”

Senior Terrence Dandridge rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns to go over the 3,000-yard mark for his career, and senior Isaiah Vaughn caught five passes for a career-high 149 yards and a score.

The offensive line did not give up a sack and paved the way for the Mules (6-2, 5-2) to rush for a season-high 260 yards and six touchdowns. The 591 total yards were the most by Muhlenberg since it gained 599 against Juniata in 2007.

On defense, Muhlenberg forced six turnovers, five on interceptions. Senior Tim Vogel had two of the picks, one of which he returned 91 yards – the fifth-longest interception return in team history.

The Mules overcame a shaky start in which they turned the ball over twice, had a field goal blocked and had an extra point blocked – all in the first 16 minutes. The blocked extra point snapped sophomore Connor Winter’s streak of 23 straight to start the season, but he nailed his next six and also added two field goals, one from a career-best 42 yards.




Sophomore Ian Gimbar recorded a team-leading nine tackles, including a sack, broke up a pass and applied the pressure that led to O'Connor's interception.


Dickinson (3-5, 3-4) took advantage of a lost fumble to take a 7-6 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass on the third play of the second quarter.

Muhlenberg responded by scoring touchdowns on its next three drives to take control of the game. A 31-yard gain on a screen pass by Dandridge set up the first career touchdown from junior Chris Litzenberger, on a 6-yard reception. On the second play of the Mules’ next possession, Deighan hit Vaughn on a post pattern for a 65-yard touchdown.

Deighan and Vaughn hooked up for another long play, this one of 43 yards, to set up Dandridge’s first TD of the day.

The Red Devils scored a touchdown to make it 27-14, then forced a punt and took over with about a minute left in the half looking to cut into the lead even more. But junior Kory Crichton picked off a pass with 35.6 seconds left, setting up the first of Winter’s field goals to give Muhlenberg a 30-14 lead at the break.

The Mules turned the game into a runaway by scoring touchdowns on three straight possessions in the third-quarter, on short runs by Dandridge, junior Kevin Van Laar and junior Joe Carlucci.  The first score came after an interception by senior Shane O’Connor, the third following a pick by freshman Marcus Allen.

Carlucci added an 18-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.

Deighan’s 313 yards, on 17-of-25 passing, were the most by a Mule quarterback since 2000 and pushed him close to 5,000 yards for his career. (corrections made 10/28)

Colleen M. Sherry  Class of 2008 Major in Theatre, Minor in Business
Freelance Equity Stage Manager





After graduating from Muhlenberg and production stage managing the MSMT production of Kiss Me, Kate that summer, I was accepted into Juilliard’s Professional Internship Program in Stage Management.  My year at Juilliard expanded my SM experiences from my strictly theatrical background into the worlds of opera, dance & events while helping me build the contacts in the NYC theatre industry that would start my career.  After Juilliard I began freelancing, earning my Equity card a year later through assistant stage managing on a small Off-Broadway production.  Since then I’ve been extremely grateful to have worked with the Atlantic Theatre Company, Second Stage, Playwrights Horizons, MCC Theatre, York Theatre Company, Clubbed Thumb, The Drama League, BC/EFA and The 52nd Street Project in New York City as well as Williamstown Theatre Festival, Chester Theatre Company & Stonington Opera House regionally.  This year’s highlight was working on the Broadway revival of A Streetcar Named Desire starting as a Production Assistant and ending as a Substitute Assistant Stage Manager, fulfilling my dream of running a Broadway show backstage. 
 
Muhlenberg gave me opportunity.  I was able to practice and hone my stage management skills over and over again on a variety of productions, from intimate ensemble pieces to double cast, large scale operettas.  With mentoring from both the faculty and the staff, I was entrusted to build my leadership skills and develop my interpretation of the role of a stage manager – all while working in beautiful, first class facilities with resources that you’d be hard pressed to find in the city!  I am so happy that Muhlenberg continues to offer their support and guidance to me today and look forward to seeing where the next four – ten – twenty years of my stage management career leads me.

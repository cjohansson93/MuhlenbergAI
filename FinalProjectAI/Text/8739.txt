The partnership with Boston University School of Medicine provides Muhlenberg students early access to one of the nationâs premiere medical schools and gives qualified students a clear path to acceptance midway through their Muhlenberg career. The agreement, which was announced in 2017, is one of three between Muhlenberg and Boston University. Additional programs include business and public health.
Muhlenberg students will typically apply to the program in the second semester of sophomore year after having completed three semesters and taken six biology, chemistry or physics courses at Muhlenberg. Juniors will be considered as well.
Qualified Muhlenberg students will be offered an interview the summer after the studentâs junior year. Satisfactory completion of an admissions interview will result in conditional acceptance to the joint program pending completion of program requirements.

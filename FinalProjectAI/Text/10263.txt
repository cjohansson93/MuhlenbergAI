Alexander Giaquinto â21
Alexander Giaquinto â21 spent the first month and a half of his remote internship with Sectigo, a New Jersey-based cybersecurity company, in training. The computer science major and business administration minor went through Linux Academy, an online course, and watched hours upon hours of tutorial videos. He also learned a few programming languages to supplement those heâs learned at Muhlenberg. 
âWhat theyâre putting me through is what they do with some of their new hires,â Giaquinto says. âItâs cool I get this experience as an intern.â
Heâs working with Sectigoâs DevOps team as a systems reliability intern. Giaquinto describes DevOps as a newer way of doing things in the industryâinstead of developing the concept for a product and then handing it off to another team to execute, both of those processes occur simultaneously and more efficiently. Now that heâs been through the extensive training, heâs able to complete service tasks in the teamâs queue.
Giaquinto anticipates needing to practice the skills heâs learned this summer throughout his senior year in order to retain them. Still, the experience at Sectigo should help his resume stand out when he looks to enter the job market.
âThe worldâs constantly dealing with security fraud in any sort of internet-based business,â he says. âWhat Iâve learned is thereâs not enough supply to meet the demand for people to work in this field.â

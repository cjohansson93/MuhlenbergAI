faust named athlete of the week



Muhlenberg senior Alex Faust was named Centennial Conference women’s indoor track and field athlete of the week.

Faust broke her own CC and school record in the pole vault at the Golden Bear Invitational, clearing 12-1¼ in the Mules' first meet of the season. 
Her winning mark hit the NCAA provisional qualifying standard. Faust also finished second in the 55 meters, just seven one-hundredths of a second 
off her school record, and ran the lead leg on the 4x400 relay team that came within five seconds of the school record. 

Faust has the third-best pole vault in Division III through reported performances of last weekend.

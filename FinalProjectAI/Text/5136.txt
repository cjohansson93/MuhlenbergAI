football coaches work charity camp



Muhlenberg coaches Mike Donnelly, Jeff Knarr and James Lastowski recently lent their expertise to Lauren’s First and Goal Football Camp,
held at Lafayette’s Metzgar Fields Athletic Complex.

The one-day clinic is one of the largest of its kind in the country, with proceeds going to pediatric brain tumor research. The 2009 camp featured a record 1,733
high school students and 275 college coaches and raised $190,000.

Lauren, the 12-year-old daughter of Lafayette defensive coordinator John Loose, addressed 


the crowd of players, coaches, parents and volunteers who turned out to support her battle 
with an inoperable brain tumor and expressed her appreciation for their continuous support. University of Connecticut head coach Randy Edsall was the keynote speaker.

In the six years since the camp’s inception, Lauren’s First and Goal 

has grown from just 56 volunteer coaches and 300 campers to one of the largest one-day clinics in the 
nation and has added a second camp at the University of South Florida, which is in its second year. Raheem Morris, head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, highlighted the 
day’s events as the guest speaker at that camp.

With the generosity of its volunteers and sponsors, Lauren’s First and Goal has raised over $700,000 in six years, seeing more than 7,000 high school players participate. 
Lauren’s First and Goal is able to donate all proceeds directly to pediatric brain tumor research and cancer services.

Faculty Summer Grant Opportunities
Faculty Summer Grants can be used to support:
1) Research or study leading to publication, exhibition, or performance;2) development of new course content (please note that pedagogical applications should be made to the Faculty Center for Teaching);3) Professional growth;4) Direct expenses. The grant application process is competitive, as requests typically exceed available funds.
All full-time faculty may apply, provided they have a continuing appointment with the College for the following academic year, and have not made a commitment inconsistent with his/her return to the College.
Proposals are evaluated by the Faculty Development and Scholarship Committee. When funds are limited and proposals are deemed equally meritorious, faculty members who have not received summer grants or college-funded leaves during the previous year will be given priority over those who have; however, faculty who have a history of significant accomplishments as a result of college funding are encouraged to apply.
FDSC may give consideration to first time applicants, who may not yet have learned how to write successful proposals for an interdisciplinary audience. In a highly competitive year, the Provostâs rule (above) may apply. An applicantâs history of previous funding and its outcomes is also considered. FDSC evaluates proposals on the basis of merit and ranks them. That ranked list is then sent to the Provost, who decides how far down the list she can fund based on the monies available.
All other information that applicants need is in the âFDSC Summer Grantsâ document, below.

Faculty may also support student applications for Collaborative Summer Grants, described at Summer Research Collaborations

Volleyball falls in four





With the Muhlenberg volleyball team up in the late stages of the second set, Morgan Duggan stepped to the service line.

One of the Mules most consistent servers, Duggan calmly delivered four serves that forced Stevens offense into a bind. While the serves were not aces, they were difficult for the Ducks to handle and 
eventually led to a 25-19 second-set win for Muhlenberg.

The Ducks, however, regrouped and the Mules could not keep the momentum from their winning set, as Stevens (10-2) went on to take the match in four, 25-11, 19-25, 25-17, 25-17.

Muhlenberg played some of its most consistent volleyball of the year in that second set, and it came against a Stevens squad that has been in the NCAA Tournament the last six years and already owns wins against three
2009 Centennial Conference playoff teams (Haverford, Swarthmore and Muhlenberg). The Mules limited their mistakes, while forcing the Ducks into nine attack errors. Every time Stevens gained the serve, 
Muhlenberg responded with quick kills to get the ball back. Stevens did not have a string of more than two consecutive serves in the set. 

Duggan led Muhlenbergs offense with 17 assists, to go along with 5 kills. Jackie Price finished with 8 kills, to lead the Mules (1-9) for the third match in a row.

Defensively, Erica Wenzel and Davi Gordon added 9 and 8 digs, respectively.

Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare (left) had a kill and blocks assist in the second-set win.

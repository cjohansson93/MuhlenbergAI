Admission 
Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies has been educating adult students in the liberal arts tradition since 1910. 
Current Continuing Studies Students:  Students may register for classes online but must meet with an advisor first to discuss the course plan for the semester. Once that has been completed, students may register via Workday. 
Prospective Continuing Studies Students: Complete an application for admission or fill in a GCE Enrollment Request Form and upload to the school's portal. 
Forms may also be faxed (484-664-3532) or mailed to the Gabriel House (2400 Chew Street, Allentown, PA 18104-5586). Please DO NOT EMAIL forms as this is not a secured method.
We welcome the opportunity to talk with you about your goals and academic background. Please contact us to schedule an advisement session to discuss admissions and the application process.

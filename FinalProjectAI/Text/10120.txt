Registration Instructions
What courses can I take? Plan right now to meet with your faculty advisor(s) to select potential courses.  As you speak with them, choose alternative courses to use if your first choices are unavailable.
How many courses can I take? The typical Muhlenberg student enrolls for 4 units per semester.  After you have successfully completed your first semester, though, you may enroll for up to 5.5 units.  During the initial class-year registration period, you will be able to register for up to 4.5 units.  Once Open Registration begins, you may add additional coursework, if you wish. 
You must enroll for at least 3 units to be considered a full-time student. Students enrolled for fewer than 3 units should contact the Office of the Registrar immediately at registrar@muhlenberg.edu.  Please note that most Financial Aid awards are closely tied to your status as a full-time student.
Where do I register?Anywhere you can access the web. During office hours, You may come to the Registrar's Office on the ground floor of Haas for assistance.
When can I register?Whenever your registration window is open. During initial class-year registration, the window usually open about 8:30 a.m. During Open Registration, you can access your record any time, day or night, through the end of the next term's add/drop period.
You will not be permitted to register if you have an outstanding obligation, whether financial (tuition balances, parking or library fines, equipment, simplex or fire safety violation bills) or otherwise to the College.  All outstanding holds must be resolved with the appropriate College office (e.g. Athletics, Business Office, Dean of Students, Library, Residential Services, Registrar's Office) prior to registration.
What if Iâm not seeking a degree? Registration for non-degree seeking students begins at Open Registration.  The Senior Scholars program has been suspended for the time being.
What if I am requesting an overload? Overload requests (over 5.5 units) are made to the Dean of Academic Life.  You must complete an Overload Request form (available in the Office of the Registrar). What do I need to fill out? To assist with your advising meeting, complete the Registration Planning Worksheet (available on the Registrar's website under Forms or  from your major department).  Please refer to the course offerings list online and in the catalog for specifics about your course enrollments.    What if I canât register at my assigned time? Your opportunity to register begins when your class-year window opens and ends on the last day of add/drop  at the beginning of the term. If a course section has room and you have fulfilled all prerequisites (e.g., a previous course, instructor consent, a limitation to certain majors), you may add courses without additional approval. You may also drop a course without faculty approval, though you should discuss these changes with your academic advisor. 
To add a course after the deadline, you must receive permission from the faculty member teaching the course.  If you've received permission (via an override) from the faculty member for adding late or another reason, you will have to manually enter the course code (e.g. ACT10101) in the box on the Registration Form window, as opposed to clicking the checkbox for the course under the "Select Course" column on the Course Schedule page.  Clicking the checkbox for a course and then clicking "Open Registration Window" will NOT process courses with overrides faculty members.
If you are unable to register exactly at your assigned time, just do it as soon as you can.  If you are not able to register for all of your desired courses right away, that is okay.  Register for what you can and come back later to add and or drop courses.  
If you canât be here because you are studying away from campus, you can still register online.  You will need to contact your advisor for approval and then add your courses via the web.  Contact the Registrar's Office if you have questions and/or problems.
How do I change my schedule once Iâve already registered? You can change your schedule using online registration any time after you register until the Add/Drop period ends.  You will not need your advisor's approval, but you will need an online course permission from the instructor to add courses that are full, create a time conflict, require a signature, etc.  If you've received an override from the faculty member for either a closed course or another reason, you will have to manually enter the course code (e.g. ACT10101) in the box on the Registration Form window, as opposed to clicking the checkbox for the course under the "Select Course" column on the Course Schedule page.  Clicking the checkbox for a course and then clicking "Open Registration Window" will NOT process courses with overrides faculty members.
Remember to check for Registration Holds before you attempt to register!

Advisors The Dean of Academic Life assigns each first-year student an initial faculty advisor in August.  These advisors are typically the instructor of the First-Year Seminar. When the student declares a major field of study, the department chair or program director will assign an advisor from within the department/program.  The student may also request a particular professor to be a formal advisor.  This request may be granted as long as both the requested professor and the department chair/program director agree to such an arrangement.  Department chairs, program directors, and the Registrar oversee the reassignment of advisees when faculty go on sabbatical or leave the College.

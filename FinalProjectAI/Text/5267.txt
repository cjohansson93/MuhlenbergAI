Sophomore Ashley Brewer pitched her second career shutout, a two-hitter, in the opener, a 7-0 win. She struck out nine and retired the last 11 batters after Heidelberg loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth.

Brewer also had a pair of hits, one to start a three-run rally in the fourth and the other to knock in a run in the four-run fifth. Freshman Brittany Blohm hit a two-out, two-run double in the fourth to break a scoreless tie. 

In the second game, the Mules overcame an early 2-0 deficit by scoring three runs in each of the first three innings and went on to win, 10-3. 

Brewer was 3-for-4 with a double, and senior RiRi Ferrigno knocked in three runs with a sacrifice fly and two singles. Sophomore Alyssa Epstein and freshman Maggie Scarpelli had two hits apiece.

big week for basketball teams


The Muhlenberg basketball teams are both undefeated in the Centennial Conference. As great as that is, it will be even greater if they can stay that way through this 
weekend.

Both teams face some challenging games this week in doubleheaders on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday that could set the stage for the rest of the season.

The Mule men are 5-0 in the CC for the first time in team history. They are in sole possession of first place, one game ahead of Franklin & Marshall and Gettysburg.
Their first two opponents this week? Franklin & Marshall and Gettysburg.

The women have a 6-0 CC record and are one of three teams in the league currently on a winning streak of seven games or more. The other two are McDaniel (6-2 in the CC) and
Gettysburg (7-0). Muhlenberg’s first two opponents this week? McDaniel and Gettysburg. 

The week wraps up with a trip to Washington, where the men have won only 



four times in 18 tries. The women have had greater success in Chestertown, though they lost
there three years ago when they were ranked No. 23 in Division III.

Only one other school in Division III (Medaille) has both its basketball teams undefeated in conference play after at least five games.


men’s notes
• Since the CC went to one division in 2003-04, the Mule men are the sixth team to start out 5-0. Each of the first five wound up reaching the CC championship game, 
with three winning the title. 

• Franklin & Marshall, an NCAA semifinalist last year, was ranked 13th in the D3hoops.com poll last week. Between 1990 and 1996, Muhlenberg notched four wins against
F&M squads that were ranked in the top 10 in Division III, all at Memorial Hall. The Diplomats swept three meetings with the Mules last year by a total of 17 points. 
The last of those games ended Muhlenberg’s season in the semifinals of the CC playoffs.

• Gettysburg is the defending CC champion. The two teams split last year, each winning on the other’s home court, with both games decided by four points or fewer.

• Sophomore Spencer Liddic (right) was named to the CC Weekly Honor Roll after averaging 18.5 points in two Mule wins last week. He leads Muhlenberg
in scoring and ranks in the top five in the CC in rebounding, blocked shots, field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage.


women’s notes
• Muhlenberg has won 28 straight against CC opponents, dating back to a loss to Ursinus in the 2008 regular-season finale. The Mules were ranked 10th in last week’s
D3hoops.com poll.

• The Mules have won five straight against McDaniel in a series that includes seven playoff meetings and six one-point games since 2002. Last year, Muhlenberg won
all three meetings, squeaking out a one-point win in overtime at McDaniel before posting more decisive victories (by 22 and 16 points) at home. The Mules won 70-64 in
Westminster earlier this season to drop the Green Terror to 0-3. McDaniel lost its next game too but has stormed back with seven straight wins.

• Gettysburg is one of six remaining undefeated teams in Division III. The Bullets take a 13-game winning streak into Tuesday’s game against Bryn Mawr.
Muhlenberg has taken four straight against Gettysburg, including the 2008 CC championship game and wins by nine and 13 points last year.

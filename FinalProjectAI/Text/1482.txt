Kathleen E. Harring, Ph.D.
13th President of Muhlenberg College
President Harring has been a member of the Muhlenberg College community since 1984 when she joined the faculty in psychology. Since that time, she has held a number of leadership roles at the College before being appointed as president in June 2020. As president, Harring has guided the College through its implementation of the strategic plan, with the development of new graduate programs, deepening of the Collegeâs work to expand diversity initiatives, and strengthening the academic program and residential life experience. She has helped steward the College through a number of important initiatives including leading the development of the integrative learning curriculum and support for the development of the institutionâs digital liberal arts learning. Most recently, President Harring has led the Collegeâs response to the current pandemic, positioning Muhlenberg as a leader in moving to virtual learning and work and in providing for the health and safety of the Muhlenberg community.

 Womens lacrosse preview


baseball falls just short of big upset


The Muhlenberg baseball team came within one inning of beating one of the top programs in Division III, but Kean scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth to pull out a 5-4 win.

The Cougars (5-0) were ranked second in Division III in the D3baseball.com poll released earlier in the day. They have averaged 37.5 wins over the last 



six seasons and made three straight trips to the World Series from 2007 to 2009, winning the national championship in 2007.

Kean scored three runs, two of them unearned, in the bottom of the first, but sophomore Billy Rogers (left), making his second career start, settled down. He allowed no runs and only one hit over the rest of his seven-inning stint, retiring 11 straight in one stretch. The righty finished with six strikeouts and one walk.

Muhlenberg didnt fare much better at the plate, managing just one unearned run and three hits over the first seven innings. With one out in the top of the eighth, sophomore John Muha reached on an infield single, and triples by senior Joseph DiCecilia and junior Jesse Nusbaum tied the score suddenly at 3-3.

The next batter, senior Clint Lynch, struck out, but the ball got away for a wild pitch, allowing Nusbaum to score the go-ahead run.

Sophomore Ryan Rechten entered in relief in the bottom of the eight and gave up a leadoff single. Lynch promptly picked a pinch-runner off of first base, and two infield popups left the Mules three outs away from their first win against a top-10 team since a 2008 upset of Johns Hopkins.

In the bottom of the ninth, however, Kean tied the score on a single and triple by the first two batters. The next hitter flied out to shallow right. The Cougar runner held at third and faked coming off the bag, but was allowed to score the winning run when the throw in sailed high and wide towards home.

Muha had a perfect day at the plate, reaching in all five appearances with two hits and three walks. He also stole two bases.

Are you ready to take your bachelor's degree to the next level?
The Master's in Applied Analytics (MAA) 4+1 program allows students to earn both an undergraduate and a graduate degree in just five years rather than the usual six or seven.
A Masterâs in Applied Analytics prepares graduates to go beyond data management and governance and develop the data analytics skills necessary to address a wide range of operational contexts. Students refine their skills through team projects and a range of problem-solving contexts, from urban analytics, urban simulation and geodemographics, to predictive analytics and population health, sustainability analytics and epidemiology.
How long is the program?
The total length of the program is five years. Students will earn a bachelorâs degree from Muhlenberg College in four years and a masterâs in applied analytics in one additional year.
What can I major in for my bachelorâs degree?
While students studying computer science, statistics or mathematics would have the most direct pathway through the program, the program is highly flexible and students may choose any undergraduate major. 
What are the requirements for the program?
Students must maintain an overall undergraduate GPA of 3.0, complete four foundational courses in statistics and programming at either the undergraduate or graduate level and earn a grade of a B or higher in all undergraduate courses counting towards their graduate degree.

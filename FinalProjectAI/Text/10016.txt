BackgroundI enjoy my role as secretary to the department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures. My full-time association with the College began in 1988 when I worked in the Counseling and Development Office, the Dean of Students office and later the Athletic office. In January of 2000 I moved into my current position. The opportunity to work with administration and now faculty has helped me to see the whole picture at Muhlenberg College. The most enjoyable part of my career is working with our students. Since my daughter has gone through the college process herself, I can relate to our studentsâ needs. Besides my work in the office, I help with employee fitness day and graduation and enjoy attending our theatre programs. Outside of work, I enjoy gardening, crafts, reading, puzzling, camping and target shooting. My two grandsons, Nathan and Kevin, keep me very busy and are a big part of my life.

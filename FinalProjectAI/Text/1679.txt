What is a Campus Security Authority (CSA)?
Campus Security Authorities (CSAâs) are those individuals designated by Muhlenberg College as holding positions related to campus safety, and those who have significant responsibility for student and campus activities. Some examples of Muhlenberg Collegeâs CSAs include: Any individual within the Division of Student Affairs (DoSA), other staff members whose functions involve significant responsibility of students and campus activities, and full-time faculty members. 
For example, an individual who oversees student housing, a student center, or student extra-curricular activities has significant responsibility for student and campus activities. Additionally, the Director of Athletics, team coach, and Student Engagement staff have significant responsibilities for students and campus activities.  A physician in student health services whose only responsibility is to provide care to students may not hold the same responsibility.  Clerical and food service staff members are not considered to be CSAâs.    
Due to the unique relationships that tend to exist between Muhlenberg College faculty and students, all faculty members are considered to be CSAâs. This is because they often serve as student advisors or otherwise form trusting relationships with students, and therefore have a high likelihood of a student reporting a Clery-related concern.
This broad definition of who is considered to be a CSA is significant â it recognizes that often times, the first person a survivor of crime discloses to is someone that they know well and trust. The response of the first person receiving this disclosure may determine whether or not the survivor feels supported and impacts the decisions they may make moving forward. 
The responsibility of a CSA is to document and report to the Department of Campus Safety any allegations of crimes that they conclude to have been made in good faith.
The criminal offenses that CSAâs are required to disclose are murder/non-negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, sex offenses (rape/sodomy/sexual assault w/object/fondling and non-forcible incest and statutory rape), robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, hate crimes, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, liquor law violations, drug violations and/or illegal weapons possession.
The College is required to disclose offenses that occur on campus, in residence facilities, in non-campus property, and on public property. To report a crime CSAâs can contact Campus Safety directly at 484-664-3110.  When there is no immediate threat or imminent concern, CSAâs can use the online reporting form: Clery Crime Reporting. If there is any doubt as to whether or not to report an incident, go ahead and report it anyway. We will take a look and make the appropriate crime classification.    
As a CSA, you serve a very important role to our campus community.  You are here to help others, including your fellow students, faculty and staff.  When a victim or survivor of a crime reports that crime to you, you become a first responder. The fact that they have chosen to share their story with you suggests that the person places their trust in you. Victims and survivors of criminal activity deserve compassion.  They should be provided with clear information about resources and fully understand their options moving forward.  As a CSA, you have the responsibility to help any reporting individual with their reporting options.

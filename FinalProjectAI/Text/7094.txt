Volleyball Drops Two in Buttermaker


The Muhlenberg volleyball team was swept by eventual tournament champion Salisbury and Gallaudet on the second day of the Buttermaker Tournament in the 16th edition of the annual event, settling for a third-place finish.

Sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller was named to the all-tournament team, finishing with 12 kills on the day after a standout performance on Friday. Weyhmuller had 14 kills and six blocks in sweeps of Penn State Abington and Neumann. 

Freshman Allison Glass produced 18 total kills, sophomore co-captain Chelsea Kaser totaled 27 digs, and junior Nikki Dickson paced the Mules with 34 assists.

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team was backed into a corner, seeking its first win of the season on the road at Gwynedd-Mercy. Using the corner to perfection, the Mules got it.

Junior Colleen Touhey and freshman Abby Lazofsky scored off corner kicks just over two minutes apart late in the first half to lead the Mules to a 2-0 victory. The late outburst was a boost to a Muhlenberg squad that managed just one total goal in losses to regionally Brockport State and Wilkes to open the season.

Junior Krissy Fioretti (right) assisted on both goals, while sophomore Nicole Karsch earned an assist on the second. Lasofsky’s tally was the first of her young career.

Sophomore goalies Jen Mermelstein and Francesca Cobuzzi combined on the shutout, with Mermelstein playing the first half and Cobuzzi preserving the victory in the second. The Mules allowed just two shots for the game.

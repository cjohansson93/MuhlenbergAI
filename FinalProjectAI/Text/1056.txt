Message to Students Abroad in European Countries other than Italy from the Office of Global Education
Thursday, March 5, 2020

Dear Students Abroad in European Countries Other Than Italy,
There seems to be some confusion on whether not we will ask you to leave your program any time soon. This email is to clarify our policy.
Currently, our policy is that students abroad leave their program when a country changes to a Level 3 Travel Advisory. Students in a country with a level 2 or level 1 warning can stay in place. You are currently in a country that is NOT a level 3 now. If it becomes one, we will make arrangements for you to finish remotely.
I hope that the rest of semester is such that you can stay and have a wonderful experience.
Moreover, all students abroad should stay out of Italy and any other Level 3 country for personal travel.
For all personal travel, please make sure you complete any travel itinerary form your provider requires. We would also request that you also complete ours athttps://muhlenberg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1ZccyxnhC6xw4Lz It is also on our Canvas course labeled GEMS (Global Education Muhlenberg Students). The form will also work on your smart phone. You do not have to be on a PC to complete it. It is also rather brief.
As I have indicated in a prior message, make sure to practice safe hygiene and, if you have any symptoms, seek medical help immediately.
I am also sending this email to your parents and guardians so they are aware of our policy.
Safe travels,
Donna M. Kish-Goodling, Ph.D.Professor - Economics Dean - Global Education

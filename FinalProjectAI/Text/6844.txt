The Muhlenberg men’s golf team had a difficult third round and finished sixth at the Centennial Conference Championships for the second year in a row.

The Mules shot a 310 – an eight-stroke improvement from the first round and their lowest score at the CC tournament in two years –
in the second round to put themselves in fifth place, just three strokes out of third. But they slipped to a 343 on the final day.

Junior Christopher Lucarelli (right) tied for ninth place with a 54-hole total of 234 – a 25-stroke improvement from last year.
He cut two strokes off his score in each of the final two rounds. 

Junior Chris DiMaio was one of eight golfers in the field to shoot in the 70s in all three rounds, tying for 11th with 
a 235. Senior Brandon Davis was one stroke back.

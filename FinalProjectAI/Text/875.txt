Welcome to the center for Jewish Life on Campus!
Muhlenberg College Hillelâs mission is to enrich the lives of Jewish students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world.
To achieve our mission and vision, our work focuses on core facets of Jewish life including Jewish learning, holiday and Shabbat celebration, arts and culture and building a meaningful, ongoing relationship with Israel. Hillel supports studentsâ spiritual growth and wellness, promotes leadership development and empowers students to make an impact on the broader community. Hillel builds relationships that promote understanding among diverse groups, advocates for Jewish students, and strives to ensure a safe and supportive atmosphere on campus.
For Hillel updates, sign up for our Hillel Happenings newsletter, and follow us on Instagram and Facebook.

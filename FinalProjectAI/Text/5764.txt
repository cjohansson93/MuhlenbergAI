Football, Men’s Soccer Among Statistical Leaders





Junior A.J. Barnold has started 13 of the Mules’ 14 games at center back.



In addition to appearing in the NCAA rankings, the Muhlenberg football and men’s soccer teams also are prominent in the NCAA statistical leaders.

The men’s soccer team has one of the stingiest defenses in Division III. As a team, the Mules were 13th in save percentage (.879), 21st in goals-against 
average (0.54) and 22nd in shutout percentage (0.62) through games of Sunday. All those numbers improved with last night’s shutout of Swarthmore. 

Senior Peter Bennett was 25th in goals-against average (0.57) and 28th in save percentage (.868)

The football team also features a formidable defense that ranks in the top 10 in Division III in five defensive categories. 
The Mules show up in offensive and special teams categories as well:

defensive categories
pass efficiency defense, 74.6 rating, second
scoring defense, 5.3 points per game, second
total defense, 162.3 yards per game, third
rushing defense, 54.9 yards per game, fifth
sacks, 4.0 per game, ninth
turnover margin, +1.1 per game, 31st

offensive categories (team)
fewest fumbles lost, 2, second
fewest interceptions thrown, 4, 24th

offensive category (John DeLuca)
rushing yards, 129.7 per game, 11th

special teams category
kickoff return defense, 15.8, 28th



The national polls conducted by coaches and media members are fun to report. For instance, it is noteworthy that the Muhlenberg football team is 17th in this week’s
American Football Coaches Association poll, matching the highest Division III ranking in team history. The Mules were 17th in 2002 after defeating Mass.-Dartmouth in the

first round of the NCAA playoffs.

But those polls are for entertainment purposes only and have nothing to do with selection to the NCAA Championships. The rankings that do are conducted by NCAA committees,
and the Mule football and men’s soccer teams both appear in those rankings, which are eventually used to determine selection to and seeding in the NCAA Championships.

The football team is fifth in the South Region, behind Mary Hardin-Baylor, Washington & Jefferson, Salisbury and Wesley. The latter two teams play each other this Saturday.
The 7-0 Mules own shutout wins against two teams ranked in the East Region, New Jersey (fifth) and Union (eighth). Although no other Centennial Conference teams are ranked,
one other has a win against a ranked team: defending CC champion Dickinson, Muhlenberg’s opponent on Saturday, defeated Hobart (ninth in the East).

Men’s soccer is third in the Mid-Atlantic Region, behind Franklin & Marshall and Messiah. The three teams directly behind Muhlenberg are Centennial Conference foes 
Johns Hopkins, Dickinson and Swarthmore. The dominance of the CC in the regional rankings (five of the top six teams) suggests that the league has a strong chance at
receiving one or even two at-large bids to the NCAA Championships. The winner of next weekend’s tournament at Franklin & Marshall receives an automatic 
bid.

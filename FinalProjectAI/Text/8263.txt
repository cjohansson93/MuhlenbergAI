Military historian Harry Yeide '82 will speak at Muhlenberg College about his upcoming book, They Bet Against America, discussing why the Axis powers thought it feasible to attack the United States at the dawn of World War II and how their thinking evolved over the course of the war as their defeat became certain.  Yeide's talk will take place on Monday, April 20, 2015, at 7:00 p.m. in the Trexler Library Concourse. This event, sponsored by Trexler Library and The Wescoe School, is free and open to the public.
Yeide has been a national security affairs analyst for the federal government for 27 years. He received a B.A. in political science and German from Muhlenberg College in 1982 and an M.A. in international affairs from the George Washington University in 1984. In his position with the federal government, he has worked as a political, terrorism and economic analyst on the Soviet Bloc, the Balkans, the Aegean, East Asia, South Asia, Africa and Latin America, and he has served in numerous assignments overseas. He is the author of a number of works of military history, including The Longest Battle and First to the Rhine. 
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year college located in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Muhlenberg offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, along with selected pre-professional studies and a number of interdisciplinary majors.

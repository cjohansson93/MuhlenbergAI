end up second on the Mules’ all-time list, and she is the only player in team history with two 500-dig seasons.

Jess Anselmi, the other senior, finished in eighth place on the career kills list (747) after putting down four against the Bullets.

Idle Muhlenberg had its playoff destination revealed when Ursinus defeated Johns Hopkins, 5-1, and Swarthmore upset Franklin & Marshall, 3-1. The Mules are the third
seed in the Centennial Conference playoffs and will face Johns Hopkins at Ursinus in a semifinal match next Saturday. Franklin & Marshall travels to Gettysburg for
a first-round game on Wednesday, with the winner advancing to play Ursinus.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams combined to have three runners earn All-Centennial Conference honors by finishing in the top 14 at the CC Championships, hosted by Franklin & Marshall.

The Mule men came in fourth, placing in the top four for the eighth year in a row. The women were seventh.

Junior Timothy Van Syckle led all Muhlenberg runners by finishing sixth, the fifth-best showing by a member of the Mule men’s team at the CC Championships. 
Junior David Chorney was 10th, giving Muhlenberg two in the top 10 for the fourth time in six years. Prior to 2002, no Mule men’s runner had placed in the top 10.

The men finished 17 points ahead of fifth-place Swarthmore, a team that was one spot ahead of them in the regional rankings.

For the women, senior Sara Gearin crossed the finish line in 11th place, improving on her 21st-place effort of last season. The women’s team has produced an All-CC runner six of the last seven years.

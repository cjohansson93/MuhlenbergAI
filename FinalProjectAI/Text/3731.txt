Strong Start for Volleyball, But No Win



The Muhlenberg volleyball team got off to a great start against Washington in a match against another team looking for its first Centennial Conference win
of the season. Behind the serving of freshman Erica Wenzel, the Mules ran off 12 straight points to take a 20-9 lead in the first set,
which they would go on to win, 25-16.

The Shorewomen, however, rebounded to claim the next three sets and take the match.

Junior Davi Gordon (11 kills, 11 digs) and freshman Morgan Duggan (31 assists, career-high 15 digs) both recorded
double-doubles, and junior Jackie Price had 8 kills and a career-high 20 digs.

Muhlenberg also dropped its second match of the day in four sets, this one to Scranton. After the two teams split the first two sets, the Royals pulled
out a tight 25-23 win in the third set to seize control of the match. Gordon again led the team with 11 kills, and junior Brooke McQueen
had 20 digs.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams enjoyed an outstanding day at the DeSales Invitational, their second-to-last meet 



before the Centennial Conference Championships.

The men placed second out of 24 schools, only losing to Division II Kutztown, and the women were third out of 21 schools, 
only trailing Division II Kutztown and Bloomsburg.

The second-place finish was the best for the men since they won the Mule/Falcon Classic in 2008 and their second-best ever at DeSales (they won it in 2006). 
The women also won the Mule/Falcon Classic in 2008 but hadn't finished in the top three in another meet since 2007, when they also were third at the DeSales
Invitational.

Leading the men's team was senior Bobby Torphy in third place, while junior William Lowery came in 18th.
For the women, freshman Nicole Cronin finished 12th. All three were presented t-shirts at the awards ceremony for their top-20 finishes.

Softball Sweeps F&M, But Misses Playoffs

Smith scored a run in each game of the doubleheader.   




Muhlenberg softball seniors Brittany Blohm and Shelby Smith will end their careers having won the Centennial Conference championship every year they were in the tournament.

Blohm and Smith were integral parts of championship teams in 2009 and 2011. The Mules missed the playoffs in 2010, and they did again in 2012 despite sweeping Franklin & Marshall on Senior Day.

Muhlenberg (19-19, 10-6) entered the day needing two wins and help. The wins came, by scores of 4-0 and 6-5, but the help did not. Splits by Gettysburg and Ursinus with Haverford and Swarthmore, respectively, left the Mules in a three-way tie for third place. In head-to-head play among the three teams, Gettysburg was 3-1, Ursinus 2-2 and Muhlenberg 1-3, leaving the Mules out of the playoffs.

The disappointing out-of-town results put a damper on a day that was otherwise very positive, featuring more records and a between-games ceremony to honor Blohm and Smith in front of a sizable crowd of Muhlenberg softball alums.

Freshman Kelsey Jones pitched a five-hitter for her second career shutout in the opener. She fanned six, setting the school record for strikeouts by a freshman (90).






Schell went 3-for-3 in the opener, with a single, double and triple.




The Mules scored all four of their runs in the second inning. Sophomore Colleen O’Donnell started the rally with an opposite-field double, and freshman Alyssa Schell drove in a run with an opposite-field double of her own. The other three runs scored on Diplomats miscues.

After getting blanked in the opening game, F&M (13-20-1, 5-11) scored a run in the first inning of Game 2, but Muhlenberg tied the score in the bottom of the frame on one swing of the bat. Not surprisingly, the swing came from sophomore Kelly Kline, who set a CC record with her 12th home run of the season.

The Mules broke the game open with a five-run fourth, with a “rally” that consisted of four walks (two with the bases loaded), a batter reaching first on a wild pitch after striking out, and finally, a hit – a bases-clearing double by Kline. The three RBI gave Kline 51 for the season, tying the school record set last year.

The Diplomats scored three runs in the fifth to cut the lead to 6-4, but with the bases loaded and two outs, Jones came on in relief to get the final out. She then pitched the final two innings to earn her first career save.

Muhlenberg drew nine walks in the nightcap, with sophomore Chelsea Benjamin receiving three free passes to tie the school record of 25 in a season.

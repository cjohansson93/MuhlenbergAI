Women Play to Draw with Swarthmore


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team picked up a key point in the Centennial Conference standings by playing to a 1-1 tie at Swarthmore.

The Garnet is ranked fifth in the Middle Atlantic Region and earlier this year defeated New Jersey when it was ranked No. 1 in the country. Swarthmore’s only CC loss this year is by one goal to No. 8 Johns Hopkins – the next opponent for the Mules.

Muhlenberg (8-3-2, 3-1-1) outshot the Garnet by an 18-13 margin and forced goalie Lauren Walker to make several acrobatic saves. One shot did get by her when freshman Jamie Weiss redirected a cross from classmate Nicolette Miller with 12:16 to play in the first half.

Swarthmore (8-3-1, 4-1-1) tied the score with 26:50 to play in the second half.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team defeated Drew, 2-1, in a matchup of regionally ranked teams.

The Mules (8-4-1) came in ranked 10th in the Middle Atlantic Region, while the Rangers (9-2-2) were fifth.

Drew’s five-game winning streak and gave the Mules a much-needed boost after losing to Washington on Saturday for the first time in program history. With Drew winning six if the last seven meetings (last season’s was called due to lightning), Muhlenberg knew it needed to get fired up.

“We knew we needed to come out with intensity,” said junior Eric Miller. “We were disappointed with our loss last week. We came out tonight with that intensity that we should have every game.”

Miller found the back of the net for the second time in two games, 10:35 into the first half off a long kick by senior A.J. Barnold that deflected off a Drew player at the top of the box. Miller collected the ball to the left of the goal and fired a nice shot into the right-side netting.

“I wanted it. It was about time,” said Miller, who was the Mules’ leading scorer last year but didn’t have a 2008 point until the Washington game. “I’m more focused now. Hopefully it continues to the end of the season when it matters most.”

The Rangers tied it up just five minutes later.

“Drew was a solid team,” said Miller. “They’re big and quick and they played rough. But we wanted it more.”

Miller assisted on the Mules’ next goal, as he hooked up with sophomore Tom Reilly 11:21 into the second half to put Muhlenberg up 2-1.

After that, it was an anxious half hour. The Mules took no shots after Reilly found the back of the net and had to rely on their defense.

“Joe’s [Gogel] always solid,” said Miller. “He’s one of our best players, the anchor. The talking and communication starts from him.”

The Mules were able to hold on for the win, extending the series lead to 9-7-1. Every game since 2000 has been decided by one goal.

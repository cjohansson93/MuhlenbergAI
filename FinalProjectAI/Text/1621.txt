	 Monday, August 22, 2005  01:59 PM

The exhibition offers a colorful, 2-dimensional look at America’s favorite pastime through the eyes of an artist who is also an avid, life-long fan of the game. There will be a reception for the artist, Wednesday, September 7, 4:30 – 6:00 p.m. in the Martin Art Gallery, Baker Center for the Arts.
As a collaborator, friend of Mason, and baseball aficionado in his own right, Dr. P. Alec Marsh, associate professor of English, will include a reading of The Promised Land, his personal ode to baseball. The exhibition and reception are open to the public and free of charge.
Whether Mason depicts panoramic views of ball parks or focuses on stopping the action of one player, he uses clean, resounding colors and handles light and shadow in a striking manner that is reminiscent of Edward Hopper. His imagery is infused with energy born of strong composition and keen understanding of his subject.
In 2004 he was commissioned by the Philadelphia Phillies to paint three 10’ x 30’ murals of Philadelphia baseball stadiums for Citizens Bank Park. He recently completed his third mural for the Philadelphia Mural Program, and in 2003 painted a 10’ x 60’ mural, Pennsylvania Agriculture, for the State Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg. His artwork, including landscapes and still lifes, is represented by the Gross McCleaf Gallery in Philadelphia. He attended the Boston Museum School and received his M.F.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, where he currently teaches.
Gallery hours are Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon – 9:00 p.m.

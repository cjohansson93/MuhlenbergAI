Scotty wood tournament starts friday


The Scotty Wood Tournament is at its most exciting when both Mule basketball teams make it into Saturday night’s championship games. But this year, there could be three Mule teams playing on Saturday night!

That, and a matchup between 20-win NCAA Tournament 

teams in the women’s bracket, are what could be in store when the Muhlenberg basketball teams open the 2008-09 season with the 27th Scotty Wood Tournament on Friday.

The men’s tournament features teams from four different states. The Muhlenberg men, seeking their first Scotty Wood title since 2005, open with Hunter on Friday night. The Mules were 10-15 last year and have almost everyone back. The Hawks, coming off their most successful season (13-14) in 10 years, lost four of their five players who averaged in double figures in scoring.

The other first-round game pits the Mules of Colby (13-12), who feature the 2008 Maine state player of the year, against Marymount (15-12), coached by Muhlenberg alum Scott McClary ’94. The Saints won the Scotty Wood title in 2004.

On the women’s side, Muhlenberg (21-7 last year and ranked 24th in the D3hoops.com preseason poll) and William Paterson (20-7) will look to get past their first-round opponents and set up a highly competitive championship game.

The Mules open up with a familiar opponent in St. Elizabeth (16-12). The two teams met last year, with Muhlenberg returning home with a 70-41 win. The Pioneers take on Penn State Altoona (10-16) in the first round.

The play in this year’s Scotty Wood Tournament may be a little crisper than in previous years. New NCAA regulations permit Division III schools to begin the season on November 15, so while these games are the first of the season for the Muhlenberg teams, Colby, Marymount, St. Elizabeth and William Paterson will come in having already played games that count.

men’s soccer gives coach milestone win


All Muhlenberg men's soccer games this year have featured a Schauer - freshman Jonathan Schauer has been a solid part of the defense that has allowed only four goals. This was the first one, however, with a shower.

Mule head coach Sean Topping took a cold but satisfying water-cooler shower after recording his 100th career win as Muhlenberg blanked Gettysburg, 4-0, in front of a large Homecoming crowd.
 
The undefeated Mules got two goals apiece from

toughest week of the season on a positive note. The Mules (5-0-2, 1-0-1) hit the road to face two of the four teams ranked ahead of them in the region - Dickinson on Wednesday and Johns Hopkins on Saturday.

"We said nothing but a win would be acceptable," said junior midfielder Steve Giannacio. "We needed to get back on track."

Steering the team back on track, as he has done all year, was Antonini, who was involved in three of the goals. After winning a 50-50 ball near midfield midway through the first half, he quickly dribbled down the field, split two Bullet defenders and fired a left-footed shot inside the near post to give Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead.

There was no more scoring in the first half, and after losing 1-0 advantages in both of their ties, the Mules were determined to maintain the lead in the second half. So what happened? Gettysburg (2-5, 1-1) got a quick corner kick to start the half, then took two shots that senior Jason Daniels had to save in the first minute.

"That corner right away gave us a scare," noted Giannacio. "Once we calmed down, we played quicker and were able to spread their defense out and get some nice goals."

Indeed, this time Muhlenberg finished the game in convincing fashion, scoring three times in the second half. The first one came after senior Matt Cecconi sent a diagonal cross through the box to Antonini. His volley was saved, but Way was there to head the ball in. A little more than five minutes later, Way used his head again to put home a long service from freshman Ryan Barlotta

Antonini netted his second goal of the game, and 10th of the season, after he received a lead pass in the air from junior Josh Luginbuhl just outside the 18. He brought the ball down with his right foot, switched to his left and beat the Bullet goalie to the upper-left hand side of the net.



Women's Soccer drops home opener


Meghan OGradys flying header of a CJ Graetzer free kick in the 63rd minute tied the Muhlenberg womens soccer team with Scranton, 1-1. But the Royals (6-3) rallied for two more goals and spoiled the Mules' (1-4-2) first home contest, 3-1.

The win extended Muhlenberg's regular-season unbeaten streak to 14 (10-0-4), dating back to a loss last Homecoming, and made their head coach only the second in program history to reach the century mark in victories. Topping's record in nine seasons is 100-45-13 (.674).

"We knew [about the milestone] before the game, and it gave us one more incentive to win," said Giannacio. "He puts in a lot of extra time and hard work to make us better. We recognize that and wanted to win it for him."

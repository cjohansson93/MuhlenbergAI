You don't need to Study Abroad to Speak Spanish!
I.   Over winter break I had the opportunity to assist a Spanish-speaking student in my mother's first grade classroom. Our local school district is rural and has very littlelanguage support. Anthony, the boy I worked with had just come to Pennsylvania from Puerto Rico, and he knew very little English. Translating for Anthony was very interesting because it was my first experience speaking the language with a native speaker.
In the short time I worked with him, we both learned from each other. He did not understand my mom at all, and he appreciated keeping up with what the other studentswere doing and knowing that he could do as well as the others. I enjoyed working with him because I actually got to use Spanish outside of school, and it was great to be able to help get him a good start in his new school.                         Sara Moerschbacher â01

 Mike Diehl â02 takes time out with some of his ESL students.
Many students at Muhlenberg participate in community service activities. One activity that holds special appeal for students studying Spanish here is teaching English as a Second Language to new and not-so-new immigrants at the Hispanic American Organization. Each week, teams of Muhlenberg students travel to the center in downtown Allentown, and teach ESL. The classes last two hours and are held four nights a week. Each team of teachers volunteers for just one week, because itâs a pretty intense week. Students plan, prepare, and teach a complete unit. In addition to the rotating weekly teams, Dr. Sutherland, along with her two student assistants, Ashley Kistler â00, Kristy Reinert â02 (in the fall), and me, Mike Diehl â02 (in the spring) go down every week to help the student teachers perform what can be an intimidating task. There are two levels taught each semester. The beginner level focuses on basic vocabulary and grammar skills, while the advanced level refines grammar skills and focuses on American culture. The experience educates both the Latino students and the Muhlenberg students. Muhlenberg students get the opportunity to make lesson plans, learn about Latino culture andlanguage, and maybe get a chance to taste some new foods. The program has been growing over the years, and the center has moved into a newer, larger building just this past year. We are proud to know weâre making a different for all parts of our community.                                                                                     Mike Diehl, â02

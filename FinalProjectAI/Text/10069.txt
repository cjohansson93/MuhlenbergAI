The Muhlenberg College is one of a handful of colleges and universities which offers a semester-long course Living Writers course and reading series. The course brings both burgeoning and established authors to campus. In addition to interacting with students, each author holds a public reading and book signing, both of which are open to the public.
Students enrolled in the course read recent works from the selected authors and then interact with the writers directly as they visit campus for a day. Writers attend classes, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening.

NSF – Research Experience for Teachers (RET)
The NSF-RET grant program is designed to involve K-12 science teachers in the various aspects of scientific research surrounding existing or newly proposed awards. The goal of the RET program is to enhance the professional development of K-12 science educators through research experience at the emerging frontiers of science in order to bring new knowledge into the classroom. This program offers the opportunity to strengthen the scientific background of teachers and build relationships within the research community.
Teacher involvement in the on-going or proposed research of the grantee may follow a number of paths. Suggestions include participating in the design of new experiments, modeling or analysis of experimental data, and follow-up by involving new found knowledge in the classroom.
Our goal this past summer was to develop a resource for the classroom that would both span all aspects of our research and serve as a teaching tool for students in an effort to meet the Pennsylvania State Standards in science and technology and environment and ecology. The development of a website linking teachers, students, and researchers will hopefully prove to be the beginning of a cooperative relationship between various levels of education.

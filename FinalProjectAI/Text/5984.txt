McDonough Named Player of the Week
 Sunday, September 4, 2011 - page 2







					 




For the first time in his career, senior Patrick McDonough of the Muhlenberg football team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

McDonough was honored for his spectacular effort in the Mules’ season-opening 10-9 overtime loss to Delaware Valley, the three-time defending Middle Atlantic Conference champion. The Aggies entered the season just outside the D3football.com top 25.

McDonough lived up to his preseason All-America billing, making a game-high 14 tackles (including a sack) to match the career high he set last year against Delaware Valley. He recorded back-to-back stops on second and third down from the 1 early in the fourth quarter to keep the Aggies out of the end zone with the Mules clinging to a 3-0 lead. 

McDonough led a defense that held Delaware Valley without a touchdown in regulation for the first time in a regular-season game since 2002.

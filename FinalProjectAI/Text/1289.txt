Campus climate is the current attitudes, behaviors and standards of faculty, staff, administrators and students concerning the level of respect for individual needs, abilities and potential.
Our mission is to create a campus where all Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff feel respected, supported, and valued. 
Report an Incident
At Muhlenberg, students', faculty and staff health and well-being and the safety of our community are of the utmost importance.  As such, we have a variety of resources, report mechanisms, policies and procedures that guide how we handle difficult, concerning or inappropriate situations within our community. 
Visit the College's incident reporting page to find the proper forms for reporting incidents regarding students as well as faculty and staff.
Do not use these forms to report events presenting an emergency and/or immediate threat to life or property. If presented with such circumstances or if you require emergency assistance, please contact Campus Safety at 484-664-3110 or dial 911.

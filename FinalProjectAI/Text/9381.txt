A new, free bus service program will allow all Muhlenberg students and employees to jump on any LANTA bus, swipe their College ID card and ride throughout Lehigh and Northampton counties, seven days a week.
The program, which began January 7, includes two new Chew Street bus stops on Muhlenbergâs campus: westbound in front of the walkway near Wescoe School of Continuing Education and eastbound in front of the Baker Center for the Arts.
The Muhlenberg/Chew Street bus stops include easy access to:


Route 213, which includes stops in downtown Allentown, Trexler Park and New Vision Tilghman Square 8 Theater (Route map)
Route 322, which includes stops in downtown Allentown, Hamilton Crossings, Trexler Mall and Movie Tavern. (Route map)


A few blocks away, an existing LANTA bus stop at 22nd and Chew Streets provides access to Route 218, which includes stops in downtown Allentown and the Village West Shopping Center (Route map).
LANTA offers four convenient ways to use the myStop bus tracker to find the real-time status of a bus, including iPhone and Android apps. With their College ID cards, Muhlenberg students and employees can also transfer buses at no charge throughout the Lehigh Valley.
The free LANTA bus service is replacing Muhlenbergâs Cardinal Shuttle service, which was previously operated by College staff. The Grey Shuttle service will continue during the Spring 2019 semester.
âThe College is pleased to offer this new partnership with LANTA which will provide free, convenient and environmentally-friendly transportation for our students, faculty and staff,â said Muhlenberg College President John Williams. âThis service will make it easier for our students to connect more extensively with the Allentown community as well as the Lehigh Valley more broadly and it will be a great option for our employees to travel to and from work.â
Muhlenberg College also recently partnered with the Allentown Parking Authority on a Zagster Bike Share program for both campus and community members.

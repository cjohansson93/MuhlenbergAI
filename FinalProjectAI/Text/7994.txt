Sophomore Jaryd Flank of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team was named runner of the
week by the Centennial Conference.

Flank finished first in a field of 46 runners at the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational to capture his first 
collegiate win. He finished more than four seconds ahead of the second-place runner and led a 
1-2-3-4-5 Muhlenberg clean sweep across the finish line.

Flank, who came in second at the same invitational last year, is only the fourth member of the Mule men’s team to win the
meet, which Muhlenberg has competed in almost every year since 1993.

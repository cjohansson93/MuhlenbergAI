Baseball Goes Extra Innings to Beat Swarthmore
 Friday, April 19, 2013







					 





Senior Rob Shannon worked the first eight innings, striking out five, picking off one runner and retiring two other runners who tried to steal before he made a move.



A bunt by Ty helped break the tie.

Junior Tyler Latrenta reached base on a bunt single with two outs in the top of the 11th and went on to score the winning run as the Muhlenberg baseball team picked up an important 6-5 win at Swarthmore.

The Mules (17-14, 5-7) entered the game tied for seventh place in the Centennial Conference and could ill afford another loss in their quest to make the playoffs. Muhlenberg has now split with three of the six teams it trails in the standings and is scheduled to play two of the other three (Gettysburg and Johns Hopkins) in doubleheaders the next two Saturdays.

The game was the only one played in the CC due to the threat of strong thundershowers (the other four on the schedule were postponed to Sunday) and started a half hour early. Even though the game went extra innings, the t-storms never came, and most of the game was played in sunshine.

It looked a little cloudy for Muhlenberg when the Garnet (19-12, 7-5) scored two runs in each of the fifth and sixth innings to take a 4-2 lead. But with runners on second and third in the top of the eighth, junior Brett Rosen delivered a clutch two-out single to tie the score.

After Rosen brought in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the top of the 10th, Swarthmore tied the score on two singles and a double steal in the bottom of the inning.

The first two batters for the Mules were retired in the 11th before Latrenta, who had entered the game as a pinch-runner in the ninth, bunted along the third-base line and was safe when the Garnet pitcher bobbled the ball. He went to third on a throwing error by the third baseman.

Senior pinch-hitter Jimmy Aramanda followed with a hard ground ball up the middle. The Swarthmore shortstop dove and kept the ball in the infield, but could not get the force at second as Latrenta crossed home.

Senior Ryan Rechten retired the side in order in the bottom of the 11th to earn his second win of the season.

Junior Nick Kennedy hit two doubles for the Mules, setting up runs in the eighth and 10th, and sophomore Nick Plinio also had two hits. Sophomore Kurt Johnson scored Muhlenberg’s first run and drove in the second.

The win was the first for the Mules in which they scored in more than one extra inning in more than 30 years.

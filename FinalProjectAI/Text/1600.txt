Muhlenberg College will host its 16th annual Jefferson Field Day, Friday, May 6. Over 700 Jefferson Elementary students will arrive at 9:15 a.m. participate in relay races, obstacle courses, and team sports managed by 200 Muhlenberg student volunteers. This day of teamwork, cooperation and friendly competition is the most widely participated-in community service event at Muhlenberg. An opening ceremony will take place at 9:30 a.m. 
State Representative Jennifer L. Mann, of the 132nd Legislative District of Lehigh County, recently contributed $10,000 to aid the Jefferson-Muhlenberg Partnership. Funneled through the PA Department of Community and Economic Development, this donation will give the 2005 Jefferson Field day a great boost.
Thanks to Mann’s contribution, every Field Day volunteer and participant will be given a tee shirt for their time and dedication.
Jefferson Field Day is the culmination of yearlong events sponsored by the Muhlenberg-Jefferson Partnership. Muhlenberg students spend several hours a week providing after-school Homework and Arts & Crafts Clubs, and through the Penpal Program, Muhlenberg and Jefferson students exchange letters over the course of the school year. In addition, monthly visits to the Muhlenberg campus serve as rewards for good behavior and hard work.

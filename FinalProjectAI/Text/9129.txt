The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of (419) likely voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between October 23 and 28, 2020.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (107) and cell phones (312). With a randomly selected sample of respondents the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence.
Key Findings: 

In the final Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll of the 2020 election season, former Vice President Joe Biden maintains a slim 5-point lead (49%-44%) over President Donald Trump in the race for Pennsylvaniaâs 20 Electoral College votes.
Bidenâs narrow lead is largely unchanged from last week when he led Trump 51% to 44% among likely Pennsylvania voters.
A plurality (49%) of likely voters in the Keystone State disapprove of President Trumpâs handling of his job, with 45% approving of the 45th Presidentâs performance in office.
As has been the case throughout the campaign, a majority (54%) of Pennsylvanians think that President Trump does not deserve reelection.
While Biden has maintained a slim lead over Trump in all Muhlenberg College/Morning Call polls from August onward, more likely voters view him unfavorably (45%) than favorably (38%).
Voters supporting President Trump are significantly more likely to be very enthusiastic (82%) about their choice, than voters supporting Biden (48%).
Democratic candidates for Congress are slightly more preferred over Republicans in Pennsylvania, with 46% of likely voters supporting Democrats, and 42% supporting Republicans.
The economy, health care, and the Coronavirus pandemic remain the top issues Pennsylvania voters say will affect their choice in the presidential race, with 27% identifying the economy, 22% selecting health care, and 20% choosing the Coronavirus pandemic.
About 1 in 3 (34%) of poll respondents report that they have already cast their vote in the 2020 election.


PDF - Final 2020 Muhlenberg College/Morning Call Pennsylvania Presidential Election Survey: Late October

Methodological Statement:The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of (419) likely voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between October 23 and 28, 2020.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (107) and cell phones (312). With a randomly selected sample of respondents the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. Interviewing was conducted by Communication Concepts of Easton, Pennsylvania under protocols established by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO.) The data has been weighted to gender, age, region, party, race and educational attainment to reflect voter population parameters. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of registered voters both land lines and cell phones were called up to 3 times. The sampling frame for the study is from the registered voters files of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To determine likely voters, only voters who have voted in 1 or more of the last 4 general elections (2016-2019), or who is a new registrant since November of 2016 were included in the sampling frame. In addition, only survey respondents from this frame who indicated that they were âdefinitelyâ or âvery likelyâ to vote in the November election were included in the sample. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by Christopher P. Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO), in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by the Morning Call and the MCIPO. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please call 484-664-3444 or email cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

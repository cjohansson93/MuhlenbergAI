MEN’S SOCCER TOPS CC HONOREES



After a surprise season in which the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team - picked fifth in the preseason poll - won the Centennial Conference regular-season title, 
the Mules were rewarded by the conference’s coaches for their great run.

Sophomore midfielder Cody Antonini was named player of the year - the first sophomore in CC history to accomplish the feat - and Sean Topping was selected as coach of the year.




Antonini, Daniels and Hayden all earned first-team honors. It is the sixth time the Mules have had three players named first-team All-CC.





Antonini is just the second Muhlenberg player to earn player of the year honors, joining Tim Averell (1995). Antonini finished second in the conference in points per game (1.62) and third in goals per game (0.75). He tied a school record by scoring in the Mules’ first eight games of the season and was one of two unanimous first-team selections.


Two others joined Antonini on the first team. Senior back Samuel Hayden and junior goalkeeper Jason Daniels also received the honor. Hayden started all 17 games at center back, helping the Mules to a CC-leading 0.43 goals-against average in conference play.




Topping is the only All-CC first-team player to later coach a CC champion.



Daniels also started all 17 games, posting a 0.70 goals-against average and .786 save percentage in his first season as a starter. He recorded six shutouts - all in CC play - and during one stretch helped hold Mule opponents scoreless for 543:38. He is the third different Muhlenberg goalie to be named to the first team in the last three years.

Senior forward Eric Miller and senior midfielder Adison Weseloh were named to the second team. Miller was second on the Mules with six goals and five assists, while Weseloh tallied two goals and one assist.

Hayden and Weseloh were two of just six men’s soccer players named to both the all-conference team and the CC Academic Honor Roll.

The Mules have had at least five players named All-CC in six of the last seven years. Their 34 first-team selections are the third most in conference history.

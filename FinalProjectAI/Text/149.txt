Michael B. London  e-mail: mlondon@muhlenberg.edu

Associate Professor - Business B.A., University of Michigan Ph.D., Case Western Reserve University




Dr. Michael B. London is an innovative teacher of management who has devoted his career to developing a student-centered pedagogy.  He applies the principles of Organizational Behavior and his background in consulting with executives and organizations toward the creation of a dynamic and lively classroom experience for students. 
Prior to joining Muhlenberg College in 2006, London taught for thirteen years at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was recognized as "Professor of the Year" in the Evening Division for 1996 and 2003. In 1989, London earned his Ph.D. in Organizational Behavior from Case Western Reserve University.  His recent work has focused on his conception of the co-created classroom, developing students through coaching, rethinking the T-Group as pedagogy, living the values of the field in the OB classroom and the use of poetry in management education for reflection and reinvention.  He also works with organizations, facilitating and mediating through team building sessions, leading T-Groups and designing Organizational Development programs.
Recently, London collaborated with his students on a conference presentation and they created a video on their experience in his courses.  In 2017, London published a book chapter, âThe Co-created Classroom: From Teacher/Student to Mentor/Apprenticeâ that details this evolving methodology.  The Course Hero website features an article on his teaching approach âImprove Learning by Co-Teaching to Help Students Feel Invested.â
On campus, Dr. London is currently the Academic Advisor to Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), the Collegeâs leadership society and is an advocate for bridging career exploration with scholarship.  Toward that he serves as the ABEF Departmentâs liaison to the Career Center, and co-directs the ePortfolio program for students majoring in Business Administration.  He is collaborating with other departments to create a Peer Leadership course with a unified certification program for peer mentors at the college. 
As a guitarist and songwriter, London performs concerts of the deeply moving, transcendental poetry of Rumi, the 13th century Persian Sufi mystic.  London uses his musical gifts and his interest in poetry to uplift participants and inspire them to be fully engaged in their learning.

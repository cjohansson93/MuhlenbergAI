Bauer Repeats as All-American
 Saturday, May 24, 2014







					 




Rising senior Tyler Bauer of the Muhlenberg men’s track and field team earned All-America honors for the second straight year, finishing sixth in the javelin at the NCAA Championships.

Bauer (right) threw a season-best 206-4 on his second attempt to finish second in the first flight of 10 throwers. He then had to wait out the second flight of 10, and when only two other competitors moved ahead of him, he was in the final.


Rising junior Jordan Rosenthal also qualified for the final by two centimeters, nabbing the ninth and final spot with a distance of 194-0 on his first throw.

Neither Mule improved his standing in the final round of three throws, with Rosenthal (left) missing out on All-America status by one place.

Both Muhlenberg competitors improved greatly on their seeding. Bauer came in 10th, while Rosenthal made a big leap after entering his first national meet seeded 17th. Bauer was one of only five throwers in the field of 20 to improve on his qualifying mark.

Bauer, who came in fifth at the 2013 national meet, is only the second member of the Mule track and field program to earn All-America honors in more than one year. The other is Alex Faust, who placed in the top eight in the women’s pole vault in both 2009 and 2010.

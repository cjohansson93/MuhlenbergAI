Muhlenberg College Welcomes Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc. to Campus

Established in 1997 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority Incorporated was founded on a desire to unite women of many cultures in one organization. In the fall of 2010, the national organization is bringing that message to Muhlenberg College with the establishment of the Rho Colony of Theta Nu Xi.
"Theta Nu Xi has a strong reputation nationally as an organization incredibly focused on the tenets of scholarship, service, leadership, sisterhood, and multiculturalism," remarked, Chris Jachimowicz, Director of Greek Affairs.
An agreement between Muhlenberg College and the national fraternity was reached in late March after the organization responded to the College's invitation to participate in its Greek life expansion process. The Committee on Greek Life, a multi-constituent group composed of students, faculty and staff, made the recommendation for colonization after reviewing materials from the fraternity and hosting a site visit by national office staff and local alumni of the Allentown City chapter of the organization.
Theta Nu Xi began recruiting almost immediately. The TNX recruitment process takes several weeks and includes events centered on the organization’s basic tenets. Interested women also complete a membership application. The organization is very deliberate in whom it invites to join. Only 3 to 5 women are chosen each semester.
Theta Nu Xi’s focus on multiculturalism and its independence from the National Panhellenic Conference will mean a unique alternative for women seeking a different type of sorority life at Muhlenberg.

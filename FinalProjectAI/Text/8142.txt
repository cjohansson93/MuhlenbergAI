Muhlenberg to Host Dr. Seyla Benhabib


The Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Yale delivers final lecture in the series, "Freedom, Personhood and Justice"


	 Thursday, March 27, 2014  02:18 PM

Seyla Benhabib, Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Yale University, will deliver the annual Danielle Dionne Guerin Memorial Lecture in Women’s Studies on Monday, March 31, at 6:00 p.m. in the Empie Theater, Center for the Arts at Muhlenberg College. Benhabib’s talk is part of the year-long series, Freedom, Personhood and Justice, sponsored by the College’s Lectures and Forums Committee and the women’s and gender studies program.
Benhabib was the President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in 2006-07 and Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin in 2009.  She is the recipient of the Ernst Bloch prize in 2009, and the Meister Eckhart Prize of the University of Cologne and the Identity Foundation in Germany in 2014 for her contributions to ethics and political theory. Professor Benhabib's work has focused on democracy, cosmopolitanism, feminism, and Hannah Arendt.
She is the author of several books, including Dignity in Adversity: Human Rights in Troubled Times, winner of the National Educational Association’s best book of the year award, together with Drucilla Cornell.
Freedom, Personhood and Justice is meant to stimulate ideas about justice and democracy through an exploration of the lived and legal experience of norms. The series will foreground the nature of the problems of racism, sexism, and other systems of exclusion. The structure of our inquiry is pragmatic, investigating societal practices that strive for the ideals of equality, fairness, unbiased thinking, freedom, and liberty, among other related concepts.

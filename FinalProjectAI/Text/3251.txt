Field hockey wins shootout at swat



Volleyball Downed at Moravian


The Muhlenberg volleyball team opened a 2-0 lead, but Moravian came back to win the final three sets and hand the Mules a 3-2 loss.

Muhlenberg swept the Greyhounds in three sets when the teams met earlier this season. 

The Mules (13-8) built their lead thanks to some outstanding blocking in the first two-and-a-half sets. Muhlenberg recorded a season-high 17 blocks in the match. Freshman Jackie Price led the way with nine blocks, the most by a Muhlenberg player in eight years, while classmate Davi Gordon had eight.

After winning the third set, 27-25, the Greyhounds (12-12) changed the momentum in the fourth set when they extended a 12-10 lead to 21-10. They went to capture the decisive fifth set, 15-12.

Senior Megan Eiser recorded seven kills, 26 assists, 12 digs and six blocks. Price had eight kills with only one error in 14 attempts.

The loss decreased Muhlenberg’s lead in the Matte Award standings to 3½-1½.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team took an early lead and survived a rapid exchange of goals in the second half to win for the second time in three games, 5-3 at Swarthmore.

It was only the fourth time in the last 10 years that the Mules played a game in which each 



Katz has four goals this season, all in the last six games.



team scored three goals. Oddly enough, the other three games were all against Johns Hopkins.

Muhlenberg (5-8, 2-4) opened up a 2-0 margin when sophomore Jess Kasza and freshman Jillian Katz scored less than two-and-a-half minutes apart in the first half. The Mules held their lead through the remainder of the half, thanks to senior Kristin Garbutt, who made her sixth defensive save of the season off a penalty corner.

Junior Tara Cohn scored her 10th goal of the season seven minutes into the second half. The Garnet (5-10, 1-6) broke into the scoring column with 18:48 left to play, and from there on no more than six minutes went by without another goal. The teams took turns on the scoreboard, so Swarthmore never got closer than two goals.

Katz added her second goal, like the first assisted by junior Kristen Sabia, and junior Nicki Notarianni scored her 25th career goal.

Michael Biren  Class of 2008 Dual Major in Biology and Theatre
Equity Actor, Dance Captain for the National Tour of Billy Elliot





A month after graduation, I was lucky enough to be starting rehearsals in the Philippines for the International Tour of Cinderella, starring Lea Salonga. After spending seven months overseas, I came back to the States and was able to further my career by playing Mike in A Chorus Line at Ogunquit Playhouse and a gangster in The Drowsy Chaperone at Maine State Music Theatre. I then performed as the swing in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Goodspeed Opera House, where I happily took my Equity Card. From there, I moved to New York City, and after five months of auditioning, I got cast in the first National Tour of Billy Elliot. I since have been promoted to Dance Captain for the current National Tour.
Muhlenberg gave me the unique chance to be able to fully immerse myself in the arts while still being able to concentrate on academic pursuits. Thanks to the support of the Theatre and Dance Department, I was able to expand my techniques and perform in nearly 20 dance pieces (several choreographed by incredible Guest Artists), seven Mainstage theatre productions, and several Summer Theatre productions — all while pursuing a dual degree in biology and theatre. My experiences at Muhlenberg College provided me with a foundation on which to build my career.

Men Drop Tourney Final


Defense and rebounding were the keys for the second straight game, but this time they were in favor of the opposition as the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team lost to host Randolph-Macon, 73-60, in the championship game of the Briggs Elliott December Classic.

In winning their first-round game, the Mules (5-4) held North Carolina Wesleyan to 31-percent shooting and owned a 24-14 second-half rebounding advantage. The story was different in the final, with the Yellow Jackets (5-2) shooting 50 percent in the second half and dominating the boards for the game, 45-25.

Just like they did against North Carolina Wesleyan, the Mules made a push late in the first half, scoring the last eight points (six by junior Darrell Roth) to head into the locker room down by only six points, 32-26. 

But after sophomore Ryan Foster scored off a steal and layup to start the second half, cutting the gap to four, Randolph-Macon went on a 9-1 run to re-establish a double-digit lead. Muhlenberg did not get closer than nine points the rest of the way.

Foster led the Mules with 14 points, and Roth finished with 11. Muhlenberg’s leading scorers in the first-round game, junior Mike Bernardini and freshman Evan Tozer, were named to the all-tournament team.

Sophomore Brenna Ferster scored five straight points to give the Mules a 68-36 lead with 2:33 left.



In keeping with the holiday spirit, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team had a little something for everyone in a 70-41 win at St. Elizabeth.

All 16 team members played between seven and 19 minutes, and 14 made at least one basket as the Mules (6-3) nicely bridged the gap between the two parts of their schedule. The team was playing for the first time in nine days and has an 18-day layoff before returning to action against Alvernia on January 5.

Seven different players contributed points to an 18-2 run over a 10-minute span of the first half, turning a 13-9 lead into a 20-point bulge. Sophomore Maiza Mock scored the last six points of the run, then added six more on a pair of three-pointers – one at the buzzer – to cap a personal run of 12 straight team points. She finished the game with 12 points, a career high.

Sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley recorded nine points, four assists and four steals, and freshman Kelly McKeon, one of four Mules to score six points, also had four assists.

track teams break two recordsin final tuneup




The Muhlenberg track and field teams made the first of their two consecutive trips to Haverford, the site of next Saturday’s Centennial
Conference Championships, to compete in the Keogh Invitational. The Mules came back from their last tuneup with two school records and two first-place 
finishes.

Sophomore Peter Rice broke a school record for the second week in a row, setting a new mark in the 200 meters after a record-setting
performance in the 400 last week. Rice’s time of 23.18 on a flat track eclipses the old standard of 23.05 on a banked track once the conversion
is applied.

The other school record came from senior Alex Faust, who knocked her own mark in the 400 down eight hundredths of a second to 59.21. Faust
finished first in that event as well as the 200, then came back to place second in the pole vault, clearing the NCAA automatic-qualifying height for the
second time.

Rice and junior Bobby Torphy (800) placed second individually and also teamed up for a runner-up showing in the 4x400, which ran a season-best
time of 3:28.90. Another member of that relay team, sophomore Chris Lysenko (left), ran a personal-best 52.71 in the 400 to land in
ninth place on the Mules’ all-time performance list.

Senior Jayne Condon (right) and sophomore Melissa Ugelow set personal records in the 3,000, with Condon’s time of
10:50.80 good for fifth on the performance list.

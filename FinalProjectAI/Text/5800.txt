MULES HOUNDED TWICE





Sophomore Kasey Hacker battles for the ball in the soccer game.



Muhlenberg fell behind in the 2007-08 Matte Award race with losses to Moravian in women’s soccer and volleyball. The Greyhounds have a 3-2 lead with the next
Matte contests (in football and women’s and men’s cross country) scheduled for November 10.

The women’s soccer team was shut out for just the second time this year, and Moravian scored with 18:24 remaining for a 1-0 win. The Mules (5-2-3) had a 14-11
advantage in shots and put two balls by the Greyhound goalie in the first half, but both were saved by a back.

Volleyball fell to Moravian for the second time this year and the 10th straight time. As in the last meeting, the Mules (7-13) fell into a 2-0 hole and came out strong
in the third game, but the Greyhounds came back to seal the match with a 32-30 win.

Sophomore Phylicia Lee established a career high in kills for the second match in a row, with 20. Junior Megan Eiser (40 assists) and senior Megan Young (21 digs) moved into the
top five on Muhlenberg’s all-time lists in their respective categories, Eiser with 1,243 assists and Young with 1,157 digs.

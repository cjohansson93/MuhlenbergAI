track teams fifth after day one at conference meet

Sophomore Alex Faust continued her total domination in the pole vault in Centennial Conference action. A year after she claimed her first conference title with a meet record of 11-0, Faust repeated her feat overcoming the same height. The Green Lane, Pa., native didn’t leave any doubts she is the best athlete in the discipline, steamrolling her opponents as the second-best athlete finished with 9-6.




Faust tied her own meet record in the pole vault, clearing a height of 11-0.


Faust scored more than half of the points of the Muhlenberg women’s indoor track and field team on the first day of the meet as she also placed sixth in the long jump with a leap of 15-11, earning three team points and adding them to the 10 she already won in the pole vault. She also had significant contribution to Muhlenberg’s fourth-place finish in the 4x200m relay. Faust along with Emily Karel, Lindsey Weidmann and Amanda Martini crossed the line in a time of 1:51.52.
Following day one action, the Mules are fifth in the team rankings with 24 points trailing behind Haverford (66), Dickinson (40), Johns Hopkins (36.5) and Gettysburg (25).
Scoring points for the squad were also Weidmann, who placed fourth in the pole vault with 8-6, and the distance medley relay team (Hannah Mitchell, Karel, Lauren Conicella and Kim Bier), which finished eighth in 13:07.37.
Junior Lucy Brock gave the fifth-best time (9.12) in the 55m hurdles heats and will compete in the final tomorrow.
The Muhlenberg men’s track and field team also occupies fifth spot after six events. Junior David Chorney took fourth place in the mile run in a time of 4:23.85. Chorney was also a member of the distance medley relay, along with Stuart Udis, William Ryan and Bobby Torphy, which placed third in 10:30.84.
Senior Michael Karchner scored points in two events for the Mules, finishing sixth in the long jump (20-4½) and seventh in the pole vault (11-6).
Brandan Kirk, Ryan, Dan Steinhart and Jeremiah Lachaud crossed the finish line with the fourth-best time (1:34.05) in the 4x200m relay.
Lachaud qualified for the final of the 55m dash, while Kirk and Adam Carter qualified for the 55m hurdles final.

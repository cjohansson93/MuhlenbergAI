jumped up after No. 1 Washington & Jefferson was upset by North Carolina 
Wesleyan in the first round of the NCAAs. St. John Fisher, which had been second, also is tied for first.

Wesley, Muhlenberg’s second-round opponent, is third in the poll.

Established in 1936 as the Lambert Trophy to recognize supremacy in Eastern college football, the award has since grown to recognize the best team in the 
East in the Bowl Subdivision. In 1957, the Lambert Cup was created to recognize non-Division I-A teams, and in 1966 a Division III award was added. 
In 1983, the Lambert family decided the Meadowlands Sports Complex would be the best organization with a sincere and involved interest in college athletics to 
sponsor and manage the award, and since that time, the awards have been known as the Lambert Meadowlands Awards.
 
To be eligible for the Lambert Meadowlands Award, a school must be located in the East or play half of its schedule against eligible Lambert teams. 
The territory includes New York, New Jersey, New England and Pennsylvania, while teams in the bordering states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and 
West Virginia and the District of Columbia qualify if half of their schedule features eligible teams.

In other Muhlenberg football news, junior John DeLuca and senior Jordon Grube earned weekly honors from the Centennial Conference. DeLuca was named
offensive player of the week for the third time this season after rushing for 186 yards and three touchdowns against Salisbury, and Grube was hailed as special teams
player of the week for the second time in three weeks after kicking the game-winning field goal. The Mules’ victory was the first for the CC in the NCAA playoffs
since 2002.

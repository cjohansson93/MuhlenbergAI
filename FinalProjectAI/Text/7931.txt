Men's Soccer Breaks Out Offense in 8-2 Win
 Wednesday, September 24, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team is known for its defense, having given up just one goal all season coming into the match against DeSales, but the Mules proved they can ramp up the offense by netting eight goals in an 8-2 win.

The eight goals were the most the Mules scored since beating Centenary 8-0 in 2001. Unlike the 2001 blowout, in which Muhlenberg scored every goal in the first half, the Mules spread out the production with five in the first and three in the second. 

Senior captain Lance Dotzman led the way with three goals for the first hat trick by a Muhlenberg player since the 2012 season finale.

“I’m pretty sure it is my first hat trick since my dad coached me when I was little,” said Dotzman. “It’s awesome for my confidence. The last couple games I hadn’t put any in the back of the net, so it was good to get a few tonight.”

The win puts Muhlenberg at 6-0-1 on the year, the first time it has been undefeated through seven games since the 2010 “Sweet 16” team was 5-0-2. The last Mule team to win six of its first seven was the 2005 Centennial Conference championship team.



Muhlenberg looked every bit the part after cracking the national top 25 this week, and the key to success this season so far is clear to senior Travis Wantchekon.

“Fitness and decision making,” said Wantchekon, who scored his second and third goals of the year in the game. “We have work to do still, but we have all the technique we need. So we need to keep working hard and be smart.”

The two seniors scored the first four goals of the game, and sophomore Jeff Remley (right) finished off the first half with his first career goal. The first tally, scored by Dotzman, and the Remley score both came off of long throws by senior Joe Adams, giving the Mules three goals off long throws into the box in the last two games.

The five first-half goals were the most for the Mules since a 2008 game against Haverford.

The second half featured three marvelous goals by the Mules. Dotzman started it off in the 69th minute with a great touch and rip from the top of the box to give him the hat trick. Sophomore Nick Sarkos put in his third goal of the year, and second in as many games, on a long shot bent in left to right. Senior Joey Roberts finished the scoring with a free kick rifled in from about 30 yards, his second goal of the year.

“This win definitely gives us a lot of confidence,” said Dotzman, as the Mules head towards the heart of CC play. “We can celebrate this win tonight, but tomorrow we need to go hard in practice. The conference schedule is what is most important, and I think the guys know that.”

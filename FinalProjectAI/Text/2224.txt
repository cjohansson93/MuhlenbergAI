New Visions After Hours
November 20-24, 2019
Selections from Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind 
By the Neo-FuturistsDirected by Matt Beaune '20 and Ben Goldberg '20
Weâre pretty sure this is the first time weâve ever produced a play where the action is determined in part by the luck of the draw. Hereâs how it works: 60 minutes will go up on the clock, and then (with some help from you), the actors will choose at random from a repertoire of very short plays, ranging from existential slapstick to soul-baring monologue All of the plays are self-aware, fast-paced, and full of surprises, and some of them are downright outrageous. Letâs see how many of them we can get through in an hour!
âUnashamedly live and democratic theatre!â âChicago Reader.

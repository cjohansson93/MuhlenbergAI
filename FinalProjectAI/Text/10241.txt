You are a torchbearer and catalyst. With no precedent set before you, against various odds, you worked hard and blazed a new trail, setting yourself up for many future triumphs. We, the Muhlenberg community, are proud of you!
So began the second annual induction announcement welcoming 53 Muhlenberg students to the 2020 Tri-Alpha Honor Society for Outstanding First-Generation Students. 
To be eligible for the Tri-Alpha Honor Society, students must have completed at least three full-time terms, earned an overall GPA of 3.2 and come from a family where neither parent nor any legal guardians earned a bachelorâs degree.
The coronavirus pandemic meant this yearâs planned induction ceremony had to be forfeited. But a celebratory announcement of the new members of Muhlenbergâs Tri-Alpha chapter included well wishes from co-directors Dawn Lonsinger, assistant professor of English, and Greg Scully, associate dean of the School of Continuing Education, and the First Generation Advocacy and Support Group. Co-president Kate Ekanem '21 and Representative Michael Rainone '20 shared videos of the speeches they would have presented at this year's induction ceremony.


Alpha Alpha Alpha was founded in 2018 at Moravian College, an initiative of Associate Provost Carol Traupman-Carr. The following year, Muhlenberg began a chapter, becoming the Delta, or fourth, chapter of Tri-Alpha in the country, and inducting the Collegeâs inaugural members on April 26, 2019. (See the full list of 2019 inductees below.)

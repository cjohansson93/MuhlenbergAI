To apply as a transfer student to Muhlenberg, we will need the following:

*If submitting test scores, ACT or SAT scores can be self-reported on your Common Application or you may submit a copy of your score reports via email to transfer@muhlenberg.edu. Our ACT school code is 3640, and note that we do require the writing portion. Our SAT school code is 2424, and we do not require the SAT-II. 
Interviews are required for all transfer applicants. If you are reopening a previous application, you are still required to interview even if you have previously done so.

International Applicants: To be considered for need-based funding and merit scholarships, please visit the international student financial aid page for forms and requirements.
Admissions decisions are released on a rolling basis after your application is complete. If applying for financial aid, we will need completed financial aid paperwork to finalize an admissions decision.
We release admissions decisions between early March and June 15 for fall admission and between December 1 and January 10 for spring admission.

Fall Priority Deadline: April 19
Fall Final Deadline: June 15
Spring Priority Deadline: November 15

It is recommended that International Applicants apply by the following priority deadlines to allow enough time for visa processing: 


Fall transfer admission: May 15
Spring transfer admission: November 15


 
Typically we admit 30-40 transfers every fall and another 10-15 for spring.

Religious Life 
Many students find religious and faith communities at Muhlenberg to be a home away from home and a chance to deepen and explore their spirituality. 
The chaplainâs office and our dedicated, welcoming religious life team serve the entire College communityâstudents, faculty and staff of any (or no) faith tradition. We offer places to pray and reflect, a variety of religious services and programs, opportunities for interfaith dialogue and more.
Diverse Faith Communities 
Muhlenberg welcomes and celebrates a broad range of faith traditions and spiritual perspectives. As a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, we have deep roots in this mainline Protestant faith. Yet our student body is religiously diverse, reflecting traditions found around the world. We encourage you to explore the services and programs we offer across the campus, including:

Ecumenical Christian Life at Muhlenberg: Offerings include chapel services, events, planning meetings and social gatherings.
Jewish Life at Muhlenberg: Activities include Hillel activities and events, Shabbat services, dinners, planning meetings, and social gatherings. 
 Roman Catholic Life at Muhlenberg: Check the Newman Center to learn about the Mass schedule and opportunities for student gatherings, meetings, and social events. 
Muslim Student Association: This organization provides common gathering and prayer spaces for Muslim students and promotes Islamic awareness across campus. 
Interfaith Connections: Our diverse religious communities work closely to learn from and support one another. 
Rejoice: The Muhlenberg College Gospel Choir is a spirit-filled musical ensemble that reflects the diverse interests and ethnicities within our community.
Disciplemakers: This Christian Fellowship group helps students grow deeper in their relationship with God and live out their faith.
MultiFaith Reflection Space: A newly redesigned reflection space is available on the main floor level of the Multicultural Life Center. It is a quiet space available for any member of the Muhlenberg Community. For those who observe Salat daily prayers, there are also prayer rugs and access to a foot bath. 

Stop by and meet us. In addition to the above communities that support students in specific religious traditions, our campus chaplain, Janelle Neubauer, is present to offer support to all students, faculty, and staff regardless of religious affiliation or non-affiliation. The Chaplainâs Office is always stocked with free tea, coffee and snacks! Find us in Egner Memorial Chapel at 2400 Chew St., Allentown, Pennsylvania, or call us at 484-664-3121.

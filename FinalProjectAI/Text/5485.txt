men’s soccer bounces back vs. hounds


Johan Steiner received an early present for his 22nd birthday when he found out he would be making his first career start in the Muhlenberg men’s soccer game vs. Moravian. And it was the gift that kept on giving, as he helped the Mules to a bounce-back 2-1 win.

The victory gave Muhlenberg the early leg up in the 2008-09 Matte Award standings as the local rivals try to settle last year’s tie. The next Matte contests are women’s tennis and field hockey matches on September 24.

“I wasn’t really expecting it, but someone got injured so it was

just kind of a coincidence,” said the junior midfielder. “I just tried to keep it simple, make short easy passes and limit mistakes. Nothing flashy. It was really fun.”

What made it more fun is that the Mules (3-2) came back from an early deficit to avoid losing a second straight game in which they had a huge edge in shots. On Wednesday, Muhlenberg lost to Wilkes 2-0 despite a 19-7 shot advantage. Against the Greyhounds, it was 21-6, but Moravian (1-4) cracked the scoreboard first when it scored off a corner kick at the 18:13 mark.

“Our defense is playing well, and the offense needs to support them by scoring more goals,” commented Steiner. “We have a lot of opportunities close up, but we can’t put them away. They’ll come eventually.”

The team had to wonder if they would come when senior Billy Dalton hit the crossbar on a free kick shortly after the Moravian goal. But with 14:34 left in the half, senior Brendan Carroll headed in Dalton’s cross from the wing for the equalizer.

Early in the second half, freshman Cody Antonini dribbled down the left wing and took a low shot that found the back of the net for his first career goal. 

“That was awesome,” said Steiner. “I was kind of waiting for him to get a goal. He could potentially score a lot of goals for us.”

The Mules held on the rest of the way to defeat the Greyhounds for the fourth straight year.

Junior Samuel Hayden played an outstanding game in the back, winning numerous head balls.

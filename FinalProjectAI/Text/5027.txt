DICKINSON BESTS MENS SOCCER IN PLAYOFFS AGAIN
 





Junior Tom Reilly and the Muhlenberg offense were shut out for just the second time this season.




For the second straight year, Dickinson knocked the Muhlenberg mens soccer team out of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Red Devils (14-3-2) scored in the 71st minute and held on for a 1-0 victory in the semifinal. They will face Johns Hopkins, who beat defending champion Swarthmore in the other semifinal, in the finals on Saturday at 7:00.

Both squads struggled to connect in the early going, with both the weather and the field conditions affecting the game. Temperatures dipped into the mid-30s, and players on each side were slipping on the slick field. There were just three shots total in the first half.

Play opened up a bit in the second half, and the Mules had their best chance in the 59th minute. Senior Samuel Haydens header off a corner kick was stopped by the Dickinson keeper, and after a scramble in front for the loose ball, it was eventually cleared by the Red Devils.

Less than four minutes after Dickinson took the lead, a Mule was sent off by a red card for the second consecutive game. But despite being a man down, Muhlenberg kept charging and nearly tied the score off another corner in the 78th minute. This time senior Adison Weseloh put a header on net with the keeper drawn out, but it was headed away by a Devil defender.

Despite the loss, the Mules (11-4-2), ranked fifth in the Mid-Atlantic region by the NCAA entering the week, still have a shot at an at-large bid for the NCAA Tournament. They will find out their fate on Sunday when the field is announced.

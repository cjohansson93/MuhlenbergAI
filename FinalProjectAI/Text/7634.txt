To grab the No. 1 spot in the Buttermaker Tournament, the Muhlenberg volleyball team needed a little help from No. 1.

Freshman Caroline Erb came in off the bench to provide a spark the only time the Mules were challenged in their run to the championship. Muhlenberg (7-1) completed its 4-0 weekend with wins against Allegheny and Shenandoah to capture its first Buttermaker title since 2005.

Juniors Katherine Boll and Chelsea Kaser represented the Mules on the all-tournament team, but there were many who contributed to a strong weekend of play. Muhlenberg won 12 of 13 sets in four matches, allowing the opponent to score more than 20 points in only two sets.

One of those sets was the first one of the second day. The Mules held a 24-19 lead before Allegheny reeled off the final seven points for a 26-24 win. 


Muhlenberg trailed 7-4 in the second set when it turned to Erb, who had played sparingly in the first six matches of the season.  The 5-11 hitter responded by recording 10 kills and seven digs over the rest of the match, helping the Mules right themselves.

Erb had three kills in a 9-0 run served by senior Nikki Dickson, which put Muhlenberg ahead for good in the second set. She put down a kill on set point in the third, then had a service run of six straight points as part of the Mules’ convincing 25-9 win in the fourth set.

Boll led all players with 16 kills, and junior Joanne Josephson added nine in only 16 attempts to go along with four blocks and three aces. Kaser (left) led the defense with 15 digs, while Dickson finished with 23 assists and three aces.

After Allegheny defeated Shenandoah, Muhlenberg returned to the court needing a win to clinch the title. The first and second sets were close before the Mules closed strong, ending the first on a 12-2 run and the second with a 10-5 burst.

With the championship within reach, Muhlenberg wasted no time seizing control in the third set, scoring the first seven points behind the serving of Dickson, who had three aces. The Mules led 12-3 midway through the set and went on to a 25-12 win.

Boll recorded nine kills in only 14 attempts to lead a balanced attacked in which four players had at least seven kills. She also had six blocks. Dickson finished with a double-double of 21 assists and a career-high 14 digs.

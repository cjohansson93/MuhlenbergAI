Three Muhlenberg teams played at Franklin & Marshall’s Tylus Field beginning at noon and ending around 8:30, and none came away with a win.

Women’s soccer played a scoreless draw against the Diplomats. It was the fifth straight Centennial Conference shutout for the Mules (6-6-2, 4-2-1),
who have allowed only two goals in seven league games.

The best chance for Muhlenberg to score was a drive from sophomore Leah Messler toward the upper corner in the net early in the second half. The F&M
goalie thwarted the attempt with a nice diving save.

With the tie, the Mules are in fourth place in the CC, behind Gettysburg and Johns Hopkins (both 5-1) and Swarthmore (5-2). Muhlenberg plays Swarthmore (Wednesday) and
Gettysburg (Saturday) this week, both at home.

Field hockey (8-5, 3-4) was scoreless with fifth-ranked F&M at halftime, but the hosts scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half and went on to
win, 3-1.

Junior Erin Cumming broke up the shutout bid with 3:23 remaining. It was the first goal allowed by the Diplomats (12-1, 7-0) in more than 500 minutes.
Junior Mariah Alston (right) assisted on the goal.

Men’s soccer lost 2-0 to the regionally ranked Diplomats (10-4, 3-3), who scored on a penalty kick in the 63rd minute and added a second goal in the late
going after the Mules (8-4, 3-3) were issued a red card.

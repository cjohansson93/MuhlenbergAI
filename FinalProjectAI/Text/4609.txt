hall of fame to add three




Muhlenberg College will induct three new members into its Athletic Hall of Fame this fall: Thomas Auchenbach 96, Will Elson 03 and the late Harry A. Haps Benfer.


Auchenbach (left) was a key member of some of the best mens soccer teams in College history. The starting center back helped the Mules to a four-year record of 60-14-6, which included two Centennial Conference championships and one trip to the NCAA Division III Final Four. Auchenbach was a first-team All-American in 1995 and a first-team All-CC selection in 1994 and 1995. The 1994 team set a school record for defensive prowess by allowing only eight goals in 20 matches. Auchenbach also contributed to the offense with 5 goals and 6 assists.



Elson (right) was the first athlete in school history to compete in the NCAA Championships in three sports (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track). He earned All-America honors three times in 2003, finishing second in the indoor 1,500 meters and third in the outdoor 800 meters and helping the distance medley relay team to a fifth-place showing. Elsons second-place finish in the 1,500 is the best ever by a Mule athlete or team at an NCAA championship. He graduated as the holder of 12 school records, four of which still stand, and was a seven-time Centennial Conference champion. Elson also excelled as head coach of the cross country teams from 2006 to 2008, leading the men to their first team qualification for the NCAA Championships.



Benfer (left) will be inducted as an honorary member. Benfer enjoyed a brief but successful coaching career at Muhlenberg, leading the football, basketball and baseball teams to winning records during a four-year period beginning in 1925. His greatest contributions, however, came in the other roles in which he served during his 40-year association with Muhlenberg: registrar, director of admissions, dean of freshman and director of dormitories.  Benfer consistently impacted student-athlete behavior through his fatherly discipline, sound but firm advice and genuine concern.  

The Hall of Fame induction ceremony is scheduled for Saturday, October 23, in the Great Room, with cocktails at 5:00 and dinner at 6:00. For more information, please contact the Office of Alumni Relations.

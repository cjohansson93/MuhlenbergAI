druker, sutker earn cc tennis honors




Muhlenberg junior women’s tennis players Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker were named to the All-Centennial Conference second team.

Druker (left) received honors for her play in both singles and doubles. She compiled a record of 9-6 at No. 1 singles, including a 7-3 mark in the CC. 
Her six losses came to four players ranked in the top 20 in the Atlantic South Region and two ranked in the top 10 in the Northeast Region, and 
her three league losses were to three No. 1 players who made the All-CC first team. Druker won her last four singles matches of the season, all in straight sets, and
has a career singles mark of 33-21 playing at No. 1 and No. 2 her entire career.

The doubles team of Druker and Sutker (right) was 8-6 overall, 6-3 in the CC, with all but one of the losses coming to ranked teams. The duo closed out the season
by winning four straight matches to remain in a tie with another active pair of Mules for the most career wins (28) by a doubles team in spring dual matches in program history.

Muhlenberg ended the year with a record of 7-8, 5-5 in the CC, and is ranked 15th in the region.

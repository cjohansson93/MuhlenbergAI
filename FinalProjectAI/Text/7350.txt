Discus Throwers Shine at Home Track Meet
 Saturday, April 5, 2014 - page 2







					 





No matter which way the gusts blew on a blustery day, several Muhlenberg track and field athletes certainly looked as if they were working with a tail wind during their outdoor home meet – especially in the discus.

Four discus throwers combined for two ECAC-qualifying performances, three all-time top-10 marks and a near miss on a school record on a day in which the Mules turned in 57 Centennial Conference qualifiers despite a chill in the air and a constant breeze buffeting Scotty Wood Stadium.

Sophomore Jessica Thimmel led the way with a second-place finish and a throw of 120-7 – a mere inch shy of her own program record set last year. Classmate Daniel Cano had an ECAC-qualifying throw of 143-9, a personal best and good for ninth on the all-time performance list.

In just her second time throwing for Muhlenberg, freshman Michelle Gaykowski landed one spot behind Thimmel (left) in third, and her mark of 118 feet placed her third on the program’s all-time list. Junior Cora Wallace vaulted into sixth on the all-time top-10 chart, eclipsing her pervious personal best in the discus by nearly three feet for the second meet in a row.

Senior Nicki Cronin, the Mules’ lone winner, captured the 1,500 meters by nearly six seconds, one of five ECAC-qualifying performances on the day.

Senior Stephanie Carnevale turned in another, finishing second in the 100-meter hurdles. Junior Tyler Bauer accomplished the feat with a throw of 198-9 at Princeton’s Sam Howell Invitational.

A pair of freshman pole vaulters, Claudia Theriault (fifth) and Jacqueline Jones (ninth), also jumped onto the all-time list. 

Sophomore Stephen Sroka and senior Andy Wolfe (javelin) earned silver medals, with Sroka (right) finishing two-tenths of a second off the pace in the 1,500.

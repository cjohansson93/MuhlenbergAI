Women's Tennis Starts Strong at King's
 Monday, September 8, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team opened its year in strong fashion yesterday, capturing four of seven singles flights and one doubles draw at the King’s Invitational, a four-team tournament that also included Marywood and Susquehanna.

Sophomore Sara Finger, senior Sharen Resnikoff, freshman Hannah Molk and junior Jenny Levenson all won in singles.
 

At No. 1, Finger dropped only four games in her two matches. Resnikoff (No. 2) also won both of her matches in straight sets, while Levenson (left) came back after a 6-1 loss in her opening set at No. 7 to win. She then proceeded to take the final, 6-0, 6-0.

The most impressive performance came from Molk at fourth singles. She won both of her matches with 6-0, 6-0 shutouts, and her reluctance to lose games extended to doubles, where she teamed with classmate  Molly Kowalski for an 8-0 win in the No. 2 semifinal. The Mule rookie duo was challenged more in the final before prevailing, 8-5.

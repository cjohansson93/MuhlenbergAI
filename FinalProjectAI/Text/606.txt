Major Certificates
School of Continuing Studies students can earn a Major Certificate from Muhlenberg College by taking evening and/or weekend classes in the traditional majors below. Students pursuing a major certificate will complete the same sequence of courses as students pursuing the major. The number of courses required for the certificate will vary depending on the number of courses required for the major; for example, the History major requires 9 courses (or 36 credit hours), while the Accounting major requires 12 courses (or 48 credit hours).
Accounting, American Studies, Business Administration,  English, Finance, History, International Studies, Political Science, and Psychology.
The following major certificates are available to School of Continuing Studies students who can attend day classes:
Anthropology, Art History, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Science, Film Studies, Languages, Literature & Cultures, Mathematics, Media and Communications, Music, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Physics, Pre-Professional Programs, Religion Studies, Sociology, and Theatre.
The School of Continuing Studies accepts comparable credits from regionally accredited colleges and universities. Students may transfer in up to half of the major from other institutions toward their Muhlenberg certificate.
I would like to schedule an advisement meeting.
If you have any additional questions or would like to speak with an academic advisor, please contact us at 484-664-3300 or continuingstudies@muhlenberg.edu.


Associates
For some students, this is a great way to earn a needed degree while they work toward a bachelor's degree. For others, an associate's degree provides the focused, two-year experience necessary to succeed. No matter what your plans, our academic advisors are always there to help you chart your course of study. The Associate of Arts Degree requires the completion of 12 courses as General Academic Requirements and 5 courses in a concentration: Business Administration, Accounting, Computer Science, or Psychology.

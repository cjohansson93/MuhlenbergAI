no playoffs, but a season-ending win for mens lax  


Playing the first Centennial Conference game of the day and in need of a win and some help, all the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team could do was take care of business against Ursinus and then hope.




Sophomore Nick Rispoli heads upfield after one of his four faceoff wins.




The Mules did their part in impressive fashion, taking a game that was tied 3-3 late in the third quarter and turning it into a 9-3 rout.

But Muhlenberg (6-7, 4-4) needed two results and did not get either. McDaniel could not knock off No. 5 Dickinson, falling 12-8, and Haverford rallied for an 8-7 win over Swarthmore. The Mules and the Green Terror finish tied for fourth in the standings, but McDaniel takes the final playoff spot by virtue of its head-to-head win two weeks ago.




Carpettos two-goal day gave him six goals for the season  triple his career total entering the year.




It was a good way to go out this year if it is our last game, said junior Andy Curley immediately after the game, with the playoff picture still undecided. It was good for the seniors to go out on and it will be good for us to build on next year.

The six-goal margin bucked the recent trend between the rivals. The previous three seasons Muhlenberg and Ursinus ended their regular seasons with one-goal games, with the Mules taking the last two. Five of their seven meetings since 2003 had been decided by just one, with the other two coming down to two and three goals, respectively.

This game appeared to be headed in the same direction until Muhlenberg took over late. Freshman Doug Rheiner finally broke a scoreless deadlock with 1:25 left in the first quarter, and Ursinus (8-5, 3-5) got on the board early in the second. Sophomore Corey Aferiat and senior Al Carpetto scored the next two, but the Bears stormed right back to tie the score at 3-all late in the third.

From there it was all Muhlenberg. Just 1:02 after Ursinus tied it Carpetto fed sophomore Alex Ardolino for the go-ahead goal with 4:25 left in the third. Carpetto then netted his second goal of the game with 42.6 seconds left in the quarter, giving the Mules a 5-3 advantage.

Junior goalie Mike Horowitz and the Mule defense shut down Ursinus the rest of the way while the offense continued to hammer away. Horowitz made five of his 13 saves in the fourth quarter, and Muhlenberg added four more goals to clinch the season-ending victory.

We played great team defense, commented Curley. Mike was great in the cage locking them down. The offense got great shots, and Al had a heck of a game shooting the ball.

With two goals and an assist, Carpetto wasnt the only senior to have a great game. Matthew Schroeder was a terror on defense and picked up four ground balls. Ari Jacobson also scored twice and caused two turnovers. Ivan Brown, Sean Delany and Will Garrity all contributed off the bench.

Theyve put out for the program for four years, said Curley of the seniors. They deserved to go out with a win  we owed it to them.

tennis doubles team posts impressive win



Women’s Lacrosse Streak Snapped


All good things must come to an end, and for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team it was a long winning 



streak that ended with a 14-10 loss to Drew.

The Mules had won 31 consecutive games against non-Centennial 

Conference opponents, dating back to a 15-9 loss to Montclair State in 2005.

Muhlenberg (5-3) never led in this one against a Ranger squad that lost by two goals to No. 5 New Jersey and by one to No. 11 Babson. The teams traded the first seven goals of the game, and Drew went into halftime ahead 5-4. 

The Rangers (3-6) appeared to be pulling away when they scored the first three goals of the second half, but the Mules scored the next three to make it a one-goal game again. It was 11-9 with less than 10 minutes to play before Drew finally pulled away by running off the next three goals.

Senior Amanda McGovern scored three goals for her 27th career hat trick, and freshman Alex Bellini (above) netted a career-high three points on two goals and an assist.

Muhlenberg sophomore men’s tennis players Jordan Rutt and Zach Adler teamed up to beat a pair of ranked opponents in the Mules’ 7-2 loss to Swarthmore.

Rutt (above left) and Adler defeated the Garnet's No. 1 doubles team, which consists of players ranked 12th and 16th in the Atlantic South Region, 8-6. Already up a break, the Muhlenberg duo had the serve and a match point before the Swarthmore team came back to win the game, making the score 7-6. But Adler and Rutt came back and broke the Garnet team again to claim the win.

The Mules’ other point came at No. 6 singles, where senior Mark Apostolos won in a third-set supertiebreaker.

Swarthmore is ranked eighth in the Atlantic South and had swept Muhlenberg the previous two years.

iMuhlenberg Mobile Application
The iMuhlenberg mobile application encompasses the policies of the Muhlenberg College Web Privacy statement -- enabling users to easily find all needed resources that they will need to succeed, which may include directory searching, employee engagement activities, reserving conference spaces, accessing campus/offices with a digital card, finding various locations, and using timeless and actionable notifications. 
 To do so iMuhlenberg uses either the device's geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) or its proximity to a specific Bluetooth beacon to determine if a push notification should be sent to the device or user.  In all cases, location information or Bluetooth beacon proximity is solely used to determine if a push notification should occur. That information is never used for any other purpose, nor is it retained beyond its use.

Requesting A Muhlenberg Web Application
What is a Web Application?
Simply put, a web application is a computer program that is used over the internet. Most web applications will generate information by either 1) collecting data using a web page, and then storing that data for later use, or 2) retrieve stored data for display of information using a web page, or 3) both of the aforesaid.
Some of the most commonly-used web applications here at Muhlenberg are:






Capstone Online
Student Elections
The Message Board




Online Placement Exams
Textbook Requisition Form
The Campus Calendar





Requests for web application development are being accepted only from campus departments with a web presence (completed site), and the student council.
Requests must be submitted to the Support Desk at support@muhlenberg.edu and are subject to approval by the OIT Department.
Please note that Web Applications are created with the Campus Community in mind. If your request is only applicable to a small number of individuals, it would be best to think of a more localized solution.

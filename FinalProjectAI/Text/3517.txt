WOMEN’S BASKETBALL HANGS ON
TO TOPPLE No. 19 MORAVIAN


In the morning, Punxsutawney Phil came out of his hole and predicted an
extended winter, and in the evening the Muhlenberg women’s basketball
team came out of Johnston Hall with a good chance of an extended season
after a thrilling 66-59 win at Moravian.

The Mules (18-2) and Greyhounds (16-4) came in as two of only five teams
in the Mid-Atlantic Region with three losses or fewer. Moravian, eight
days removed from a win

games. 



against one of the others (Messiah), was ranked 19th in Division III by
both the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association and D3hoops.com.

It was the first win for the Mules, themselves ranked 26th in the WBCA
poll, against a nationally ranked team in 14 tries, since a 79-66 defeat
of Scranton in 2002. That was also the last year they defeated their
Lehigh Valley rivals.

 Muhlenberg led from the opening tap – literally. Junior Meghan
Courtney tapped the jump ball to senior Stephanie Coluccini,
who drove in for a layup just three seconds into the contest. The Mules
held the Greyhounds without a field goal for the first seven minutes,
opening up a 14-4 lead. After Moravian finally made a shot, Muhlenberg
answered with three buckets in a row to make the score 20-6.

The advantage was 17 at halftime after the Mules ended the first 20
minutes with a 9-0 run. A three-pointer by senior Lacie Smith gave
Muhlenberg its biggest lead, 55-35, with 11 minutes to play in regulation,
and that’s when things started to get a little hairy.

Using pressure defense to force Muhlenberg turnovers, the Greyhounds went
on a 10-0 run to cut the gap to seven, at 59-52, with four minutes left.

Kristen Piscadlo resulted in a three-pointer to extend the lead
back to 10, but Moravian scored the next seven points, closing to within
62-59 on a three-pointer with 43.3 ticks left.

On the ensuing possession, the Mules isolated Courtney on the left block,
and she took Piscadlo’s lob pass and converted a layup with 20.6
seconds left, making the score 64-59. Courtney’s defense at the other
end forced a traveling call, and Piscadlo made two free throws with 8.7
seconds left to ice the win.

“We would have liked to keep the big lead,” joked freshman
Lauren Boyle. &#147But we usually hit a bump in the second half and
this will give us more experience later in the season.&#148
<P>
Boyle was instrumental in helping Muhlenberg build that big lead with both
her offense and her defense. She broke out of a shooting slump to score 15
points, eight of them on four straight Mule baskets late in the first half
&#150 one a pullup jumper from near the top of the key as the shot clock
went off. She also drew three offensive fouls in the first five minutes of
the second half, one of which also drew a technical foul on the Greyhound
coach.
<P>
&#147Sometimes a defensive stop can be more important than an offensive
play,&#148 Boyle said. &#148[Taking a charge] is definitely a confidence
builder and gives everyone more energy.&#148
<P>
Courtney led all scorers with 24 points, including 18 in the first half.
She also pulled down 11 rebounds for her third straight double-double.
Smith just missed a double-double, with nine points and 10 rebounds. 
<P>
Piscadlo had eight assists, tying the school record of 117 in a season she
set two years ago, and added eight points, five rebounds and five steals.
Senior <B>Stephanie Coluccini</B> contributed four points, seven rebounds
and five assists. The seven rebounds made her only the fourth player in
team history with 500 points, 500 rebounds, 100 assists and 100 steals.
<P>
The victory gave Muhlenberg a 6-4 lead in the Matte Award standings for
the 2005-06 year. The next scheduled Matte contest is a men&#146s tennis
match on March 14.

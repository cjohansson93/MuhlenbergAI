	 Wednesday, September 18, 2013  09:48 AM

Novelist, journalist and playwright Colm Toibin will give a public reading at Muhlenberg College on September 23, 2013 at 7:00 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall.  The reading, which is free and open to the public, is part of the College's Living Writers series.
Toibin is the author of numerous novels, The South (shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award and winner of the Irish Times/ Aer Lingus First Fiction Award), Homage to Barcelona, The Heather Blazing (winner of the Encore Award), The Story of the Night (winner of the Ferro-Grumley Prize), The Blackwater Lightship (shortlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Prize and the Booker Prize and made into a film), The Master (winner of the Dublin IMPAC Prize; the Prix du Meilleur Livre; the LA Times Novel of the Year; and shortlisted for the Booker Prize), and Brooklyn (winner of the Costa Novel of the Year).
His short story collections are Mothers and Sons (winner of the Edge Hill Prize) and The Empty Family (short-listed for the Frank O'Connor Prize).   
He is also a noted journalist, and he is a regular contributor to the Dublin Review, the New York Review of Books and the London Review of Books. His creative nonfiction includes a memoir, A Guest at the Feast, and numerous essay collections.
His play "Beauty in a Broken Place" was performed at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin (2004).  His play "Testament," directed by Garry Hynes, was performed in the Dublin Theatre Festival with Marie Mullen in the lead role.  "A Testament for Mary," directed by Deborah Warner and starring Fiona Shaw, recently opened on Broadway.
Living Writers, established in 1994, is a course offered once every three years that brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening.
Future readings will be given by writers Patrick Lawler (10/7), Kay Ryan (10/21), Terrance Hayes (11/4), and Chris Ware (11/18).

Academic Mission - School of Graduate Studies
In keeping with the Collegeâs mission, graduate education continues the goal of developing each individualâs capacity for a life of leadership and service by challenging and strengthening mind, spirit, character, and community. The School of Graduate Studies contributes to intellectual life at the college by enabling graduate students to engage in scholarly study and research, and to prepare for professional work.
Graduate Programs Overview
The Muhlenberg College Division of Graduate and Continuing Education offers graduate degrees with multiple pathways that provide flexibility for the adult learner to create their graduate experience. Degrees and certificates are taught in a format that blends in-person classroom discussion with online and virtual components.
Masterâs degree programs are designed to give experienced professionals and more recent college graduates the skills and expertise to be highly successful in their field. Each degree program can be completed within two calendar years.
Graduate-level certificate programs allow professionals to hone in-depth knowledge in a particular field to expand their skills, gain a competitive advantage in hiring and promotion, transition to a new career, and earn credit that can transition to the corresponding masterâs degree. Certificate programs can be completed within one calendar year.
For both degree and certificate programs, two consecutive eight-week courses will run each fall, spring and summer term.  
The Office of Graduate Studies is located on the second floor of Peter F. Gabriel House and is open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 8 a.m. to 5 a.m.; Tuesday and Thursday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. by appointment.

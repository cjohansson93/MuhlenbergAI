âBerg Prof Invited To Participate In Planning Conference On Small Arms



J. Christopher Kovats-Bernat, assistant professor of anthropology at Muhlenberg College, has been invited to participate as one of 25 scholars nationwide in the Planning Conference on Small Arms.


	 Tuesday, June 28, 2005  01:59 PM

The conference is organized by the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (Temple University) in conjunction with the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation's Research Initiative on Small Arms.  The conference, to be held July 9 and 10 at Columbia University, will coincide with the United Nation's second Biennial Meeting of States. In addition to paper presentations and roundtable discussions, conference participants will attend the proceedings of the two United Nations meetings on small arms. Two more conferences in 2005 and 2006 will host fifty U.S. scholars to discuss original research on small arms issues. The conference papers will be published in book format. Kovats-Bernat graduated from Muhlenberg College with a degree in philosophy and received his M.A. and Ph.D. in anthropology from Temple University. He has done extensive field work in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, studying the effects of poverty and state violence on their economic strategies and the development of their cultural identity and social agency. He has also studied ritual and sorcery in Haitian Vodou and recently traveled to São Paulo, Brazil to conduct ethnographic fieldwork among street children in the Centro district of the city.

busy weekend for track and field teams









Members of the Muhlenberg track and field teams competed in three different meets from Thursday through Saturday, and when they all met back up on campus they
had collected a school record, an NCAA provisional qualifier and two second-place marks on the all-time performance list.

The busy weekend began on Thursday and Friday, when sophomore Michael Baer (top) and freshman Colette Faust (bottom) traveled to Kutztown for
the Mondschein Multi, where they competed in their first career decathlon and heptathlon, respectively. Baer finished with 4,668 points, the sixth-best total in team history,
and Faust totaled 2,844 points.

On Friday night, three Mules competed at the Larry Ellis Invitational at Princeton. Senior Jennifer Lynch hit the NCAA provisional mark in the 1,500 meters for the
second time this season, clocking in at 4:37.16. Senior Jayne Condon ran an impressive 5,000 meters, landing in second place on the performance list with a time of
18:00.61. The performance that had been in second place was good enough to win the Centennial Conference in 2005. Junior Bobby Torphy ran the 800 meters in 1:55.48.

Torphy joined the rest of his teammate at Moravian’s Greyhound Invitational and ran the 800 again on Saturday afternoon, improving his time to 1:54.33 to finish in 
second place to a runner from Lehigh in a field of 52. The most noteworthy performances at Moravian came in the men’s 400 and the women’s 800.

In the men’s 400, sophomore Peter Rice broke a 15-year-old school record with a time of 49.61 in tough windy conditions. He finished in sixth place, trailing
five Division I runners. In the women’s 800, sophomore Kimberlee Yalango was the surprise winner even though she wasn’t in the “fast” heat.
Yalango’s time of 2:17.37 beat her previous personal best by nearly four seconds and put her in second place on the performance list.

Both Rice and Yalango also ran on the 4x400 relays, helping their respective teams to fourth-place finishes.

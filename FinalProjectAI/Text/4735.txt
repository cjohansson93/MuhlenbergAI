baseball comes back to give cresta no. 20


A 26-3 win counts the same in the standings as a come-from-behind 6-3 win, so which is better?

Winning 26-3 was a lot nicer because we could all relax, said Joseph DiCecilia with a laugh. Today was a nailbiter.

Relaxed or not, DiCecilia played a big role as the 




Beck doubled in a run in the ninth and finished 4-for-5, raising his average to .333.





Muhlenberg baseball team completed its season sweep of Dickinson by scoring all of its runs in the last four innings to win, 6-3, three days after the 26-3 win.

Senior Phil Cresta pitched a complete-game seven-hitter to earn the 20th win of his career, moving him within one of the school record. The lefty struck out nine and finished with a flourish, retiring 15 of the final 17 hitters after allowing an unearned run in the fourth. The only hitter to reach base with a hit during that stretch was promptly picked off by Cresta.

Phil had his stuff today, said DiCecilia. He gave up some hard hits early on, but between the sixth and the ninth he was lights out. He really mixed in his strikes and kept them off balance.

The Mule hitters didnt fare much better against the Red Devil hurler, managing just two hits in the first five innings. With Muhlenberg down 3-0, freshman John Muha  batting leadoff for the first time in his career  opened the top of the sixth with a double and was sacrificed to third. DiCecilia got the Mules (14-14, 8-6) within a run with one swing of the bat, belting his seventh home run of the season.

It seemed like a good idea to try to hit the ball to the outfield, to get the run in, he said. I got a fastball where I liked it and it just carried out.

Muhlenberg got the tying run into scoring position that inning but couldnt drive it in, then went down 1-2-3 in the seventh. Muha sparked a rally again in the eighth, leading off with a single and advancing to second on senior Eric Pomroys second straight sac bunt.

DiCecilia drove in the tying run with a single and went to second on the throw home. He scored the go-ahead run on a single through the right side by sophomore Brian Beck, who in turn came home on a two-out hit by freshman Joseph Vila, capping the three-run outburst.

The Mules added another insurance run in the ninth, and Cresta struck out the final hitter to close the books on the win, which moved Muhlenberg into a tie for third place in the Centennial Conference with Swarthmore. The Mules are a half-game ahead of Franklin & Marshall, which was rained out against Haverford, and a game in front of Washington heading into Saturdays big home doubleheader against fourth-ranked Johns Hopkins.

At the beginning of the game we were really flat, but in the middle innings and late in the game we really got into it, said DiCecilia. Were going to need that momentum to beat a good team like Johns Hopkins.

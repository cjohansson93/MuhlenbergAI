Windows XP
The U.S. International keyboard layout and language-specific keyboard layouts are available in Windows, but not enabled by default. See below for the steps required to enable the U.S. International keyboard layout, for example. Note that the same steps can also be used to enable other keyboard layouts, such as those used in other countries.


Click Start, go to Run, type intl.cpl, and press Enter on your keyboard.
On the Languages tab, click Details.
Under Installed services, click Add.
In the Input language list, select English (United States) .
Check the box next to Keyboard layout/IME. From that list, select United States-International, and then click OK.
 Optionally, select US International from the drop-down menu at the top of the Text Services and Input Languages dialog box to make it your default keyboard layout.
 Optionally, click Key Settings and define hot keys for switching between input languages. Example: Switch to English (United States) – US: Left Alt+Shift+1. Switch to English (United States) – United States-International: Left Alt+Shift+2.
Click OK to apply your changes and exit the dialog box.
In the Regional and Language Options dialog box, click OK.

The Language bar should appear on the taskbar. Click the Language bar, and then click United States-International on the shortcut menu that appears. Select English (United States) or another keyboard layout from the shortcut menu to switch back to that keyboard layout.
Note that the Language bar will now always be visible on your taskbar, unless you decide to remove it. To do so, right-click on the taskbar, go to Toolbars, and uncheck Language bar.

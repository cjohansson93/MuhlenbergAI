Freshman golfer makes big debut 



Womens Soccer Beaten; Mens Tennis Opens


It was a case of déjà vu for the Muhlenberg womens soccer team, which lost at Oswego State, 2-1.

The Mules' weekend trip to New York went the same way as their opening weekend trip to New Jersey: tie on the first day, one-goal loss on the second. 

Junior Meghan OGrady scored a goal for the third straight game to tie the score at 1-1 early in the second half. Junior Nicolette Miller served a cross from right to left to the center of the box, and O'Grady shot it inside the right post. But the Lakers scored the winner on a rebound with just under 6 minutes to play.

Freshman Chris DiMaio shot a 2-over-par 74 in his first collegiate round to lead the Muhlenberg mens golf team to second place after the first round of the Penn State Harrisburg Invitational.

The Mules trail the host school by four strokes heading into Mondays final round.

DiMaios score was two strokes off the lead and led four Muhlenberg golfers who shot in the 70s. Senior Zachary Oyer came in with a 76, senior Eric Boskey (right) a 78, and junior Zack Meyers a 79.

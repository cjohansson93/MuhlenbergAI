Golf Teams Host Large Tournament

Last year, the Muhlenberg men’s golf team tried to host its annual tournament in the second week of October, but rainy conditions forced the competition to be 
halted after nine holes. This year, the Muhlenberg Invitational was two weeks earlier, and the weather could not have been any different.

A large field of 20 teams and 100 golfers enjoyed the sunshine and mild weather in the combined men’s and women’s tournament. The Mule men’s team
tied for sixth out of 17 teams, while the women were second out of three.

Senior Kristin Lang (right) took advantage of the ideal conditions to tie for second with a career-best 91 – 12 strokes better than her previous low
round. Junior Christina Bryde was sixth with a 95, and sophomore Kerrilynn Lanza shot a birdie on the par-3 16th hole.

Muhlenberg’s team score of 395 was its lowest since the 2008 Centennial Conference Championships.

The men had all five of their players shoot between 80 and 82, with senior Christopher Lucarelli and sophomore Greg Hewitt
coming in at 80. Sophomore Jonathan Graulich (left), competing as an individual, tied for 10th with a 78.

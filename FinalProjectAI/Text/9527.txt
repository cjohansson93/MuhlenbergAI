Maye-gan Brown '20, student director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, shares some key takeaways from the recently released NSEE survey.
Since 2008, the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College have conducted the NSEE, a biannual national opinion survey on energy and climate policy. The principal researchers of this latest release are Chris Borick, professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO), and Sarah Mills, senior project manager at the University of Michigan's Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP).
The full report is available for download (NSEE 10-Year Survey). For methodology and additional information, view the report or visit the MCIPO or CLOSUP websites.
The Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy, housed at the University of Michiganâs Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, conducts and supports applied policy research designed to inform state, local and urban policy issues. Through integrated research, teaching and outreach involving academic researchers, students, policymakers and practitioners, CLOSUP seeks to foster understanding of todayâs state and local policy problems and to find effective solutions to those problems.
The Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion was founded in 2001 with a mission to conduct scientific-based research related to public opinion at the local, state and national levels. Since its founding, the MCIPO has focused its attention on measuring the publicâs views on electoral and public policy issues with a concentration on environmental and health matters. MCIPO earned an A in FiveThirtyEightâs 2018 Pollster Ratings.

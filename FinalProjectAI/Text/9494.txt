Muhlenberg College is one of the nation's best institutions for undergraduates to earn their college degree, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company profiles and recommends Muhlenberg in the 2020 edition of its annual college guide, The Best 385 Colleges.
The College is also featured on the 2020 Best Value Colleges and Best Northeastern lists as well as the Green Colleges list. Muhlenberg recently announced a new sustainability studies major and a newly revised sustainability studies minor which offer students an interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex environmental challenges and developing solutions to effect real change.
In response to The Princeton Reviewâs survey questions, Muhlenberg students had the most agreement on these topics: Students are happy, lab facilities are great, class discussions encouraged, great financial aid, students are friendly, great food on campus, easy to get around campus, recreation facilities are great, theater is popular and thereâs an active student government.  
In the survey, Muhlenberg students also championed their âdedicatedâ professors who understand how to create and foster âengaging coursesâ and appreciated that they âreally take the time to get to know you and answer your questions.â
A French and education double-major said, âMost people are involved with many different aspects of campus life, and these aspects tend not to be âcliqueyâ because of the crossover. For example, there are many football players who are members of a cappella groups or who take dance.â Students said they felt it was quite easy to lead a full and fulfilling life on campus but also gave a shout out to Allentownâs public parks which provide âgreat areas to hike, explore, bird-watch, read or take a jogâ and said they periodically capitalize on Muhlenbergâs relatively close proximity to both Philadelphia and New York.
Only about 13 percent of Americaâs 3,000 four-year colleges are profiled in the book, which is one of The Princeton Reviewâs most popular publications. The company chooses the colleges for the book based on data it annually collects from administrators at hundreds of colleges about their institutionsâ academic offerings. The Princeton Review also considers data it gathers from its surveys of college students who rate and report on various aspects of their campus and community experiences for this project.
The Princeton Review is an education services company known for its tutoring, test-prep courses, books and other student resources. It is headquartered in New York, New York, and not affiliated with Princeton University.

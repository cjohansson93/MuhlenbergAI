RALLY, LATE-GAME HEROICS GIVE BASEBALL SPLIT 


Facing a team that reached the NCAA Tournament last year and had already played six games this season, the Muhlenberg baseball team may have seemed like a fish out of water in its season opener.

That is, until a Fisher saved the day.




Pomroy reached base in all four plate appearances in game two, doubling in the first, tripling home a run in the third and walking in the fifth and sixth.





Senior Dan Fisher knocked in the winning run in the top of the seventh and then recorded the save in the bottom of the inning to give the Mules an 8-7 win in the second game of a doubleheader against Alvernia in Dodgertown.

After being beaten by the Crusaders 8-3 in the first game, Muhlenberg appeared to be in danger of a sweep after falling behind 4-0 in the first inning of the second contest. Alvernia made it 7-2 after five, but the Mules rallied in the fifth behind a barrage of base hits.

Fisher led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on a single by junior Jeff Puklin. Senior Eric Pomroy then drew a walk, loading the bases for junior Joseph DiCecilia.

DiCecilia hit his second sacrifice fly of the game to bring in Fisher, and sophomore Nick Busillo kept the hit parade going with another single, plating Puklin. Junior Bobby Spindler smacked another base knock to make it 7-5.

Alvernia (6-2) recorded a second flyout, and junior Eli Branzburg stepped up to the plate with two out and two on. Branzburg smashed a triple, bringing home both runners and tying the game at 7-all.

Branzburg then made a huge defensive play in the bottom of the sixth, ending a Crusader threat by throwing out their leadoff hitter
at second on a stolen base attempt.

With the score still tied in the final inning, freshman Joseph Vila hit a one-out single and stole second. With two outs classmate Taylor Sutton walked, bringing up Fisher with men on first and second and two down.

Fisher came through, delivering the go-ahead single. He then took to the mound in the bottom half of the inning in his first appearance as the Mules closer. The Crusaders threatened with a one-out double, but Fisher struck out the next batter and induced a grounder to himself for the final out.

Junior Jason Daniels settled down on the hill after the four-run first to pick up the win, finishing with six strikeouts and just one walk.

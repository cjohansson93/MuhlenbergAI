Homan Finishes Third in Opening Tournament
 Saturday, November 5, 2011 - page 2







					 



The first day of Kevin Homan’s senior season with the Muhlenberg wrestling team was tiring, but successful.

Homan made an incredible run through the consolation bracket to finish third at 149 pounds at the Monarch Invitational, hosted by King’s. He went 7-1 on the
day, with five of his bouts going the distance.

After winning his opening bout, Homan was pinned in 1:05 by the top seed, a wrestler from Wilkes who was an All-American last year and is ranked fourth in his class
in Division III.

Homan came back and won his first two bouts in the consolation bracket by shutout. After picking up a pair of forfeit wins, he defeated two seeded Oneonta State
opponents, including a 5-0 win against the second seed in the consolation final.

Junior Nick Pallotta, one of two other Mules in the tournament, pinned an opponent in 38 seconds for his only win.

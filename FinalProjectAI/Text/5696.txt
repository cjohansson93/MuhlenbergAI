boyle leads mules past gettysburg





This layup by junior Erin McSherry tied the score at 16 midway through the first half.


An unseasonably warm January day was made even warmer in the Gettysburg gym by the double-Boyler effect. It was almost a triple-double-Boyler effect.

Junior Lauren Boyle narrowly missed a triple-double, totaling 22 points, a career-high 10 assists and nine rebounds to lead the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team to a key 76-57 win.

Men Lose Despite Flurry of Threes



The power of three – and threes – wasn’t quite enough for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team.

With three players combining for all but eight of their points, the Mules fell at Gettysburg, 88-73, in a matchup of teams that began the day tied for second place in the Centennial Conference. 

Leading the way was junior Mike Bernardini, who erupted for a career-high 31 points, the first 30-point game by a Muhlenberg player in two years. Junior Darrell Roth scored 18 points (all in the second half), one short of the career high he set in Wednesday’s win against McDaniel, and sophomore Ryan Foster added 16.

The trio combined for 13 three-pointers, one short of the school record for a regulation game. 

Two runs – 18-2 in the first half and 13-3 to end the first half and start the second – made the difference for the Bullets (10-2, 5-1), who are off to their best start in 69 years.

Muhlenberg (6-7, 4-2) cut an 18-point deficit to seven with less than eight minutes left, but Gettysburg held on and made 10 free throws in the last two minutes to seal the win.

to the Bullets in the Mules’ Centennial Conference opener. It is only the second time in history that Muhlenberg has overcame an 0-1 CC start to run its league record to 5-1.

“The first time we played them we were running a new system, and we were still adjusting,” said freshman Sheila Cook, who scored 10 points. “This time we got into a rhythm much easier.”

Boyle was in rhythm the entire game, coming up one rebound short of the Mules’ first triple-double in 20 years. She almost singlehandedly helped the Mules (9-3, 5-1) take control of the game late in the first half.

With 1:11 left in the half, Boyle made two foul shots to give Muhlenberg a 34-32 lead. Fifteen seconds later, her steal led to a fullcourt layup by freshman Kelly McKeon. After a Gettysburg miss, Boyle fed Cook for a jumper, and she added two more free throws with 1.5 seconds left to complete the half-ending 8-0 run.

“Lauren is a great player, and she makes everyone better,” said Cook. “She’s not the type of player who’s all about herself.”

The Bullets (7-5, 4-2) shot only 33 percent in the first half, and that included two banked-in threes. The Mules did an even better job on defense in the second half, holding Gettysburg without a field goal for the first 6:55. With Boyle contributing four points and two assists, Muhlenberg opened the half with a 12-2 run to build an 18-point lead.

The Bullets never got closer than 12 points and shot 27.9 percent for the game – a far cry from the first meeting, when they connected on 45.6 percent of their tries.

“Defensively we really stepped up,” noted Cook.

McKeon finished with 19 points and a career-high 11 rebounds for her second double-double. She also had five steals.

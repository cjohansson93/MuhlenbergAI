Youth & Prejudice
Due to the ongoing health crisis, the Institute will not be able to hold the Youth & Prejudice: Reducing Hatred, Lessons of the Holocaust conference as an in-person event this year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to partnering with school communities in teaching the historical realities of the Holocaust and preparing students to be upstanders against prejudice in todayâs world.
Last year we were able to move the conference to a virtual format and created a variety of resources including survivor testimonies, discussion/reflection questions, dramatic performance, poetry and art, and a variety of activities adaptable for either classroom or at-home use. We are continuing to expand these resources and will make them available to our school community partners for use again this year.
If you are an educator who would like to receive more information about participating in this event, please email us at religionandculture@muhlenberg.edu.

 Track and field NCAA preview

Women's lacrosse tightens clamps,swats away Yellowjackets





Junior Sarah Hetrick scored off of a free position shot 18:52 into the second half to give her goals in back-to-back games for the first time in her career.





Hilton Head used to be a home away from home of sorts for Christine Van Hise. Since her uncle lives there, she used to take many trips down to the island when she was younger.



Van Hise and her teammates on the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team have made themselves right at home in Hilton Head, defeating Rochester 14-5 for their second win in three days on their Spring Break trip.



Its really nice, especially since its my last year playing, to be able to come down here and have my family come to the game, said Van Hise, who hadnt been down to Hilton Head in a while and whose uncle had never seen her play.



Van Hises family in attendance may have thought, for the first 10 minutes, they were going to see a more competitive game than the Mules season-opening 17-10 and 15-3 wins.






Sophomore Alexandra Franck tied her career high with five ground balls against the Yellowjackets.




Rochester, playing its first game, scored the first goal 73 seconds in and took advantage of Mule turnovers to take a 3-2 lead with 20:12 left on the first-half clock.



I feel like we were rushing too much in the beginning, said Van Hise. When we started settling down and working the ball around to find the open girl is when we had the most success.



Back-to-back goals by senior Danielle Rosen put Muhlenberg ahead to stay and kicked off a long dry spell for the Yellowjackets. They went almost 45 minutes of game time without scoring a goal, thanks to better overall play and some nice saves by senior Allisyn Vachon. By that time the Mules had achieved the womens lacrosse version of saying uncle!  a 10-goal lead and a running clock.



Rosen scored all three of her goals in the 11-0 run and finished with eight points on three goals and five assists (corrected 3/12). Junior Angela Napoletano scored three goals for her third hat trick in a row to start the season.



Van Hise pleased her family by scoring back-to-back goals 16 seconds apart as part of Muhlenbergs four-goals-in-five-minutes blitz to start the second half. Both came on quick sticks, with Van Hise one-timing a pass from Rosen into the net.



Its awesome to do those, she said. You only have so many seconds to shoot. You dont want to take the time to cradle the ball and get it checked out of your stick. And it looks cool.



The Mules are looking cool too, starting 3-0 for the second year in a row.



Our team chemistry is so good, said Van Hise. Its a total team effort. We dont have just one person playing well. Its everyone from the defense all the way to the attack.

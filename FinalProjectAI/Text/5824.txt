Football Shuts Out TCNJ in Opener


Seniors Chris Musselman and Dustin Good each recorded two sacks as the Muhlenberg football team opened its 2007 season 



"We had complete confidence in our defense," said Cresta. "We were confident that we could just keep grinding and eventually score."




with a 15-0 shutout at The College of New Jersey.

It was the first time the Mules started a season with a shutout since 1984, when they blanked Dickinson, 46-0. Muhlenberg totaled seven sacks in the game and held the Lions to minus-32 yards rushing and 91 total yards. TCNJ did not convert any of its 13 third downs.

In defeating TCNJ each of the last three years, the Mules have allowed minus-30 yards on 78 rushes.

The Lions drove into Muhlenberg territory on five of their six second-half possessions, but were turned away each time, once on an interception in the end zone by junior David Mazzola.

Muhlenberg scored all of its points in the second half. Ahead 3-0 early in the fourth quarter, the Mules finally broke through for their
first touchdown on a third-down play from their own 35. Junior Eric Santagato rolled left, then had to scramble to the right to avoid the rush. He threw back across the field
just over the hands of the TCNJ cornerback and into those of sophomore Phil Cresta, who outran the secondary for the TD.

Cresta, who did not catch a pass last year, finished with four catches for 113 yards, including a 12-yard reception at the 1-yard line that set up the final touchdown, a 1-yard run by junior John DeLuca with 2:22 left.

DeLuca led the ground game with 84 yards on 25 rushes. Good finished with a career-high 11 tackles.

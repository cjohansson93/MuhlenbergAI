softball bats “bus”t out


The Muhlenberg softball team had trouble getting to Cabrini for its non-conference doubleheader because its large bus couldn’t get under 



Consiglio hit a double and drove in a run with a bases-loaded walk in the second game.



overpasses. But the Mule hitters had no trouble finding their way home.

Muhlenberg enjoyed 
its best offensive day of the season, erupting for 18 runs and 22 hits in a split with Cabrini. A 13-5 victory in the first game snapped the Mules’ 10-game losing streak, and only a late Cavalier rally in Game 2 prevented a sweep.

Muhlenberg scored multiple runs in four innings in the opener. A walk, a single and three wild pitches brought home two runs in the first inning, but it was all the Mule bats in a four-run third. With the bases loaded on three singles, junior Michelle Consiglio hit a two-run double. Another run scored on a groundout, and sophomore Jenna Van Waalwijk knocked in Consiglio with a double.

Sophomore Allie Saltstein hit

The Muhlenberg women’s golf team sent three members to the Ursinus Invitational. Sophomore Sarah Mellick shot a team-best 110.




an RBI single in a three-run sixth that gave Muhlenberg a 9-1 lead. 

Cabrini rallied with four runs in the bottom of the inning, but the Mules (6-22) put the game out of reach with four in the seventh. Freshman Jess Kasza drove in two runs with her team-leading sixth double of the season, and two more scored on an error.

Saltstein, Kasza and freshman Ashley Brewer all went 3-for-5 in the game, with Brewer scoring four runs, to help senior Katie Vecchione earn her first win of the season.

Muhlenberg played “Powerball” in the second game, hitting two home runs in a game for only the seventh time in team history. Freshman Alyssa D’Addio led off the contest with her second home run of the season, and classmate Alyssa Bruckner hit a two-run shot in the fifth, becoming the fourth Mule freshman with a round-tripper this season.

Bruckner’s blast gave Muhlenberg a 5-2 lead, before Cabrini (12-19) plated four runs in the bottom of the sixth to steal the game.

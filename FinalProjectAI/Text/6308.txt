Hellings’ javelin throw ranks fourth in the Centennial Conference this season.




In its final tuneup before next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships, the Muhlenberg track and field team rested a great number of its regulars at the Lehigh Games.

Even still, the Mules have several impressive performances during their third straight trip to Bethlehem, including 17 new or updated conference qualifiers.

Junior Ryan Hellings moved up to sixth place on the all-time performance list with a throw of 176-7 in the javelin. He also finished seventh in the pole vault after clearing 12-6.

Sophomore Stephanie Carnevale turned in Muhlenberg’s highest finish of the day, placing second in the high hurdles. Her career-best time of 15.55 places fifth on the performance list. She was joined in the top eight by classmate Amber Lee Wojtkowski, who came in sixth.

The Mule men also placed two in the top eight of the intermediate hurdles, where sophomore Jeff Phillips (5th) and senior David Kurtis (7th) both broke the one-minute mark. Phillips’ time of 58.19 shaved more than a second off his personal best.

Sophomore Jarrett Felix finished sixth in the first competitive 400 of his career, and freshman Kirsten Kuchera rounded out the Mule placewinners with a sixth-place finish in the 200.

Freshman Cassiah Sahl and sophomore Lauren Zakheim both posted conference qualifying times in the 1,500. Sahl’s time of 5:00.15 was almost five seconds better than her previous best.

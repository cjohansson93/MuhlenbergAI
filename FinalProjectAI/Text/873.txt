Rejoice, the Muhlenberg College Gospel Choir, is a spirit-filled musical ensemble. Comprised of students from various places, races and creeds, the Gospel Choir is truly reflective of the diverse interests and ethnicities within the Muhlenberg College community.
Their common bond is their love of music and a passion to praise God through song.

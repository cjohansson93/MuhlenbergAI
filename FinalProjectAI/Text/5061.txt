FIELD HOCKEY BACK ON WINNING TRACK



The Muhlenberg field hockey team hadn’t lost four straight since 2005, and it wasn’t about to let that change on Wednesday night.

The Mules (7-5, 3-3) topped Swarthmore 4-1 on the strength of two late first-half goals to bring their three-game losing streak to an end and conclude their four-game homestand on a high note.




Three of Kasza’s four goals this season have come off of penalty corners.





“We’ve just been concentrating on getting back to basics and having fun, because that’s why we play field hockey in the first place,” said senior Nicki Notarianni. “We communicated well tonight and it showed.”

Muhlenberg was certainly communicating well early on, as it was awarded four penalty corners in the game’s first 20 minutes. After three failed corners, the Mules finally connected on the fourth, when sophomore Shelby Smith corralled the insertion and made a pass to junior Jess Kasza for a one-time shot. Kasza blasted it into the left corner of the net past the diving Garnet keeper to give Muhlenberg an early lead.

Men’s Soccer Draws with Drew



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team traded first-half goals with Drew, and the teams went on to a 1-1 tie. It was the first draw of the season for the Mules (8-3-1) but a common occurrence for the Rangers, who are 6-3-5.

Muhlenberg netted an early goal against a Drew defense that allowed only five scores in its first 13 games. Junior Mike Williams scored on an uncontested volley off senior Eric Miller’s lobbed assist 19:10 into the match. Drew tied matters on a penalty kick late in the first half after the Mules were called for a hand ball in the box; it was the first goal allowed on the road by Muhlenberg this season.

Both teams had chances to break the tie in the second half and two overtimes, but neither did.

tied the score 11 minutes later when it was awarded a penalty stroke and converted, but the Mules didn’t wait long to jump back in front. Exactly one minute later Notarianni took a cross from sophomore Courtney DeAngelis and buried it into the net for her fifth goal of the season.

Just over three minutes later Muhlenberg padded its lead on a nice move by junior Chessie Martinez. Martinez evaded a defender with a pass to herself and sent home a shot from the top right corner of the circle, making the score 3-1.

Swarthmore (5-9, 1-5) fought hard in the second half, outshooting the Mules 7-3, but freshman Kristen Dornenburg made six of her eight saves in the second period to keep the Garnet off the board.

Kasza added an insurance goal in the 56th minute, when sophomore Renee Norton kept possession in the middle of the field and found her open in the circle. Kasza’s shot deflected off a Swarthmore defender and into the net.

The win was the Mules’ fourth straight against Swarthmore, and it keeps their playoff hopes alive as they prepare for a four-game road swing that begins at No. 10 Johns Hopkins on Saturday.

“The Hopkins game is our game,” said Notarianni. “They’re good, but we feel we’re just as good. We know we can come out and play well.”

	 Wednesday, September 14, 2005  01:59 PM

The “Acres of Diamonds: the Architectural Treasures of North Philadelphia” exhibition highlights of some of Philadelphia’s greatest yet least known buildings and features around one hundred large format photographs produced by Elliot. The exhibition is based on the work of the National Park Service’s Historic American Buildings Survey; HABS documented the neighborhood’s structures with a team of historians, architects and photographers during the summer of 2000.
The exhibition, conceived by Michael Stern, assistant professor at the Community College of Philadelphia and a preservation architect, will run from September 6 – 30, 2005 in the College’s Rotunda, 1700 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, Pa.
The exhibition spotlights the architectural treasures of North Philadelphia and also examines the rich history associated with the buildings. The opening reception on September 14 will be followed by a presentation by John Gallery, Executive Director of the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia, and Elliott will also lead a discussion on the art of photographic documentation.

Track: Two Runs Are Worth 1,000 Records


Two weeks after senior David Chorney and junior Jennifer Lynch of the Muhlenberg indoor track and field teams both won the 3,000 meters at Lehigh, they combined for a similar double.

Chorney and Lynch both set school records in the 1,000 meters at East Stroudsburg’s DeSchriver Invitational. Chorney’s record time of 2:30.73 won his race by almost four seconds, and Lynch was second to a Division II runner with her time of 3:07.16.

Lynch also ran away with the mile, winning by 10.8 seconds with the second-fastest clocking in team history (5:14.80). Four meets into her career, she is first or second on the Mules’ performance list in three events (1,000, mile and 3,000) and fifth in another (800).

Junior Alex Faust won the pole vault at the East Stroudsburg meet for the third year in a row.

Senior Stuart Udis, whose 1,000-meter record Chorney broke, finished first in a field of 58 in the 800 meters. Sophomore Bobby Torphy came in third in the event, one of two in which Muhlenberg had two of the top three finishers: sophomores Matt Lauletti and Rob Nihen went 2-3 in the 3,000 meters.

The Muhlenberg wrestling team won the last four bouts at the last four weight classes to defeat Scranton, 26-12, in a makeup of a match that was postponed last week.

Trailing 12-9 after six bouts, the Mules (3-6) tied the score on a 4-3 decision by senior Justin Fitch at 174. Senior Matt Horn followed with a technical fall at
184 to put Muhlenberg ahead, 17-12. Horn has a team-best record of 23-2, including a perfect 16-0 mark at 184, and is the only Mule to have won his bout in all nine dual meets.

Sophomore Bill Sholly clinched the match for Muhlenberg with a 5-0 decision at 197, and freshman heavyweight Nick Pallotta put the icing on the cake by
pinning his opponent in 75 seconds. Pallotta (above) has 10 wins this season, all by pin, five of them in two minutes or less.

Volleyball Rolls Past Ursinus in Final CC Match

The Muhlenberg volleyball team took care of business in its last Centennial Conference match of the season, sweeping
Ursinus in a match that took less than an hour.

The Mules (24-5, 8-2) looked like a team poised for a playoff run, hitting .424 with only five attack errors and holding the Bears (13-14, 1-9) to
a negative hitting percentage in the 25-9, 25-17, 25-9 win.

Muhlenberg tied its best CC record ever with the win. The Mules will await the results of Saturday’s matches involving
Swarthmore, Haverford and Johns Hopkins to learn its playoff seeding.

Muhlenberg jumped to leads of 6-0 in the first set, 8-1 in the second and 8-1 in the third and never let its lead slip to
fewer than five points thereafter.

Junior Joanne Josephson led the Mules with eight kills in only 12 attempts and added two solo blocks.
Junior Sarah Weyhmuller also hit efficiently, with six kills in just eight tries. Sophomore Allison Glass
added seven kills and four blocks.

Nikki Dickson, one of three seniors playing in their final scheduled home match, had 11 assists and two 
service aces to move to within two of tying the school record of 69 aces in a season. Senior Holly
Hynson contributed a kill and three blocks, and the third senior, Julia Elkin, recorded three digs and
served the final three points of the match.

Sophomore Elizabeth Garrison (right), who served the first six points of the match, finished with
a match-high eight digs.

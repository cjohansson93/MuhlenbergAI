Update to Students & Families from Dean of Students

Monday, March 16, 2020

Dear Students, 
I hope you have made it home safely and are preparing for remote learning classes to begin on Wednesday, March 18. We want to give you a brief campus update on the COVID-19 crisis.
On March 16th, Lehigh County declared a state of emergency. In addition, today the Governor of Pennsylvania ordered that all non-essential businesses and restaurants close for the next two weeks. Currently, there are 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Lehigh Valley with additional individuals being tested. 
If you begin to show symptoms related to COVID-19 (coughing, shortness of breath, fever) within 14 days of when you left campus, it is essential that you contact the Health Center, in addition to your primary health provider, as soon as possible so that we can assist in notifying those you may have had contact with on campus.
Here are updates related to campus services that I wanted to make sure you are aware of:Access to Campus Facilities:
Students who were not approved for access to campus facilities MAY NOT return to campus. If you left an essential item (i.e.medication, academic text book, etc.), please email housing@muhlenberg.edu and we will work to ship it to you. For all other items, you will have to wait until campus is reopened to all students.  
Counseling Services:
If you experience an imminent emergency, please call 911.
Counseling Services is offering remote consultations, including urgent concerns, via Zoom or phone in lieu of in-person contacts. 
If youâd like to obtain a consultation with a counselor, you may complete this form or call 484-664-3178 and we will assist you in scheduling a consultation time. Upon completing the scheduling and informed consent forms, a member of our team will respond to your request within 24 hours.     
After hours: Counseling Services will offer urgent, on-call counseling after hours (4:30 p.m. - 8:30 a.m. on weekdays and throughout the weekends). This can be accessed through the main Counseling Services phone number 484-664-3178. 
Academic Resource Center, ODS, and Course-related Issues:
The Academic Resource Center and Office of Disability Services (ODS) are closed for in-person visits, but they continue to meet with students online regularly. The Academic Resource Center is taking tutor requests until March 27. Use this link to request a tutor arcstudent@muhlenberg.edu. If you already have a tutor, your tutor should have already been in touch with you about continued support. Contact David Hallowell (davidhallowell@muhlenberg.edu) if you have any tutor related questions or if you have not heard from your tutor.
Students who work with ODS should have already received specific communications for remote support meetings from ODS staff concerning continuation of regular appointments. Contact your ODS support person directly with any questions or concerns via email.
For questions about the Writing Center contact Pierce Lockett (piercelockett@muhlenberg.edu).
The Dean of Academic Life is available to connect with any student having difficulty managing coursework remotely or who would like to discuss any course related concerns.  Contact Dean Deegan at micheledeegan@muhlenberg.edu.
Financial Hardships (including trouble with internet access):
Now that you are home, if you have an immediate financial emergency (not related to tuition and fee refunds) OR if you have learned that you do not have a stable and secure internet connection, please fill out the emergency grant fund form and we may be able to assist you remotely with these funding needs.
If your concern is related to internet access, we suggest you contact your local provider and identify yourself as a college student to find out if they have any discounts or free services to support you. If they do not, please have them provide you a quote for set up and service.  Please include that cost information in your grant request. In the short term, if you have a cell phone, you can utilize it as a mobile hotspot for internet service.  
Even though we are working remotely for now, all of our offices are still open and receiving emails and phone calls. Please reach out for assistance if you are in need.  
Thank you and be well,Dean Gulati

Parents & Families
Muhlenbergâs relationship with parents and family members is an important component of a successful college experience for all students.  We count on you to support your studentâs career exploration and development process.  The easiest way to do this is to stay up to date on the services, programs, and events that we offer.  On our end, we will try to communicate with you about offerings that might interest your student as well as be available to talk with you if you have any questions or concerns.
We consider all parents and families part of our larger community and network.  As such, we would encourage you to consider two options to get involved with the Career Center:
1.  Give Career HelpOffer a student a chance to work alongside you for a day. Apply to host a group of students at your company as part of our Career Road Trip series. Are you an expert in your field? Share your knowledge with fellow Mules. Speakers might be used in our webinar series, during Alumni Week, or as part of other events.
2.  Post Jobs & InternshipsWe post opportunities for students as well as experienced alumni.  We encourage you to share any opportunities you may have at your workplace or business.  Instructions for posting jobs and internships can be found on the Employers page.
We look forward to assisting your student in discovering their potential and developing the tools and confidence to pursue their dreams.  If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact us.

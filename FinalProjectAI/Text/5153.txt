Senior catcher RiRi Ferrigno of the Muhlenberg softball team was selected to the Louisville Slugger/All-East Region third team by the National Fastpitch Coaches
Association.

Ferrigno helped lead the Mules to the Centennial Conference championship by hitting .373 with a team-leading three home runs and 27 RBI. She also tied for the team lead
with nine doubles and was second in batting average, slugging average (.555) and on-base percentage (.405).

A second-team All-CC selection, Ferrigno finished her career as the program’s all-time leader with 90 RBI. She tied the school records for career home runs (six) and
doubles (36) and was second in extra-base hits (44), third in total bases (196), fourth in hits (138) and fifth in fielding percentage (.981).

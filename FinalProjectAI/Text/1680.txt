Brian Fidati, DirectorPronouns: (he/him/his)Email: brianfidati@muhlenberg.edu
I've been with Muhlenberg for 10 years, including five as the director of campus safety. Previously, I served more than 25 years in the Pennsylvania State Police, with a 20-year focus on emergency management and response.
It is my responsibility to position the Department of Campus Safety and Police to provide a safe, inclusive and welcoming campus environment. I continually strive to develop a model department made up of diverse, well-trained and dedicated members who operate as a team devoted to serving the Muhlenberg College community.
In my spare time, I enjoy attending and watching Penn State football games, spending time with family in rural Pennsylvania and woodworking.






 

Brenda Lakis, Associate DirectorPronouns: (she/her/hers)Email: brendalakis@muhlenberg.edu
This is my 26th year with Muhlenberg. During that time, Iâve held various roles within campus safety. Currently, I oversee all the life-safety systems (smoke alarms, fire extinguishers and so on) on campus.
The College has always felt like my second home. This job has offered me an amazing opportunity to meet so many students and staff over the years. To be able to build relationships with students that last a lifetimeânothing is a better feeling. I also have a son who is a âBerg alum, which gave me the perspectives of both employee and parent.
I love RVing and spending time in nature, away from it all. I am a mom to six adult children, and I have two grandchildren as well.

Ruth Morris, Officer ManagerPronouns: (she/her/hers)Email: ruthmorris@muhlenberg.edu
Iâm delighted to say Iâm in my 30th year with Muhlenbergâs Department of Campus Safety and Police, though I donât understand how that could possibly be! I started as the Collegeâs switchboard operator and part-time dispatcher in 1991, and my job has evolved over the years.
I love helping people, and my job has offered me many opportunities to assist Muhlenberg students and parents as theyâve tried to figure out where to go with their questions and problems.
I feel a special connection to Muhlenberg College. I completed my bachelorâs degree in art (with a concentration in sculpture) at Muhlenberg in 2012. I serve on the faculty/staff campaign committee, which oversees donations to the College by Muhlenberg employees.
In my downtime, I love to spend time with family. My husband and I have three amazing grown childrenâtwo are Muhlenberg alumni, and the other is married to an alumâand feel blessed to have eight grandchildren. I still love art, and I look forward to the time when I can return to the sculpture studio with a slab of clay in front of me.

I have been full time with Muhlenberg since November 2021. 
I was new to dispatching before working with Campus Safety, but received on the job training which allowed me to gain more experience. 
 I'm committed to the Muhlenberg community because I love watching the interaction of the students and staff together, as well as making sure I do my part to keep everyone protected by ensuring information is communicated to the offices. I love being able to grow with each and everyone here and continue being a helping hand.
 In December 2020, I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security and Networking. Since then, instead of doing homework, in my freetime I love spending time with my two young daughters at home, playing with our family pet geckos Wizard and Nubbs, playing video games with my fiance, and visiting my step daughter. I also love doing puzzles and sudoku.

Iâve been a dispatcher at Muhlenberg since November 2017, and Iâve undergone specialty training via the College as well as the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials.
Iâm committed to the Muhlenberg community not only because I grew up familiar with the Collegeâitâs basically in my backyardâbut also because of how proud I am that the community sticks together and does its best to treat everyone like a family. Muhlenberg's dedication to unity and a better path into the future is a commitment worth working both for and towards.
In my spare time, I enjoy the arts, particularly sketching, painting and music. I also have an appreciation for the theatre.

Secondary Programs
The secondary certification program is designed to offer a broad range of field experiences that enhance the candidateâs understanding of the relationship of pedagogy to the subject matter areas in secondary schools. Students should make their major department advisor aware of their interest in seeking secondary certification as early as possible as some majors have specific course requirements within the major for certification.
The Education Department works closely with academic departments to offer approved programs of study leading to certification. Requirements for each major can be found in the college catalog under the specific department. In an effort to help students select the appropriate courses for the major while meeting the requirements of certification, students are assigned both an advisor in their major and in the Education Department.

The Education Department accepts the following majors for corresponding content certificates:

Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Mathematics
English
French

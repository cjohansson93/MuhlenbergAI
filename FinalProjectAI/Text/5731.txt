women’s hoops turns over new leaf








After dropping its Centennial Conference opener at home to Gettysburg a week ago, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team turned things around with a 78-63 win
at Haverford.

The Mules (2-2, 1-1) forced 26 turnovers while committing just 10 themselves. Although the Mules were outrebounded and shot a lower percentage than the Fords (0-4, 0-2),
the turnover margin enabled them to take 21 more shots.

Junior Lauren Boyle shook off a slow start to finish with 20 points, eight rebounds and five steals. She made just one of her first 11 field-goal attempts, but 
scored 16 points in the second half.

Sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley (left) scored in double figures for the second game in a row, with 11 points, and freshman Kelly McKeon recorded nine points, five assists
and five steals. McKeon had five points, two assists and two steals in an 18-5 first-half run that turned an 11-6 Muhlenberg lead into a 29-11 runaway. Haverford got no
closer than nine points the rest of the way.

Muhlenberg has defeated Haverford 31 straight times since 1992.

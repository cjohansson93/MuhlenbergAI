The Muhlenberg volleyball team won in its match and elsewhere, clinching its first Centennial Conference playoff berth after defeating Ursinus in four sets.

The win, combined with losses by Johns Hopkins (in four sets to McDaniel) and Gettysburg (in five sets to Franklin & Marshall), assured that the Mules (17-8, 7-1) will finish in the top five teams in the CC. Muhlenberg can clinch a first-round bye by winning one of its two remaining league matches and will earn the top seed and hosting rights if it wins both.

Just three years ago, the Mules tied for last place. But an infusion of talented players turned the program around, and they were on display against the Bears (7-16, 0-8). Muhlenberg won its three sets with ease, 25-13, 25-14 and 25-12, dropping the third by a 25-22 count.

Sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller (left) led the attack with 11 kills in only 19 attempts, while junior Lindsey Gambocurta, sophomore Katherine Boll and freshman Allison Glass had nine apiece. That quartet combined to hit .389, and Glass added four aces.

Junior Nikki Dickson recorded 17 assists, running her career total to 997, and sophomore Vanessa Pulica added 15.

Sophomore Joanne Josephson (eight blocks) and Weyhmuller (five) took care of the defense at the net, sophomore Chelsea Kaser (15 digs) and freshman Elizabeth Garrison (10) in the back row. Kaser became the first player in program history to record at least 300 digs in both her freshman and sophomore seasons.

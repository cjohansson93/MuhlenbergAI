Muhlenberg College Public Health Program: April 2020 Pennsylvania Health Survey

The following report (April 2020 Pennsylvania Public Health Survey, PDF) provides findings from the annual Muhlenberg College Public Health Program Survey of Pennsylvanians on public health issues. This yearâs survey examined topics that included health care reform, heroin addiction, immunizations, marijuana legalization, the coronavirus outbreak and the performance of President Trumpâs handling of health care matters.
"This year's survey results show growth in the number of Pennsylvanians that think providing health care coverage is the responsibility of the federal government, with 6 in 10 now holding this view," says Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. "It's notable we fielded this year's survey during the first two weeks of March as the COVID-19 outbreak expanded in the United States."
The survey marks the eighth year of this initiative that is a partnership between the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) and the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program. The results of the coronavirus questions (Q: 24 and 25) were released in an earlier report (March 2020 Pennsylvania Public Health Poll—Coronavirus Report), and the results of questions on sports safety (Q: 21-23) will be released in a separate report.
KEY FINDINGS 

About 6 out of 10 adult Pennsylvanians gave health care in the state a positive rating  (âexcellentâ 17%, âgoodâ 42%), but 16% rated health care in Pennsylvania as poor, marking an 11 point jump from 2019, when only 5% of state residents offered this rating. 


Nearly 6 in 10 Pennsylvanians (59%) think it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure that all Americans have health care coverage. This is an increase of 5% since 2019, when 54% of Pennsylvanians maintained this view. 



Pennsylvanians are fairly divided on a proposed âMedicare for allâ plan, with 48% favoring such a proposal and 40% opposing this option. 
While divided on âMedicare for all,â 3 out of 4 Pennsylvanians support a âpublic optionâ under which the federal government would allow individuals to purchase Medicare or keep their private insurance. 
Support for legalization of marijuana in Pennsylvania rose to its highest level in the history of this poll (dating back to 2013), with 56% of Keystone State adults now supporting legalization, compared to a record low of 26% opposing this policy option. 



4 out of 5 of Commonwealth residents maintain that heroin abuse is a very serious problem, but there is strong division on the use of supervised injection sites for individuals addicted to heroin or other opiates, with 45% supporting this option and 45% opposed. 



A record number of Pennsylvanians (57%) strongly disagree with the claim that childhood immunizations increase the likelihood of a child becoming autistic, marking a 22 point increase since 2013, when only 35% of adult Pennsylvanians strongly disagreed with this claim. 

"The growth in the number of Pennsylvanians that reject claims that childhood immunizations cause autism is a positive sign that public health communication efforts do have an effect," says Borick. "It's hard to get rid of unfounded or erroneous beliefs once they take hold, but in the case of the immunization-autism link, progress is being made."


Over 7 out of 10 Commonwealth residents (71%) disagree with the claim that children in the United States receive âtoo many immunizations.â 
A majority (54%) of Pennsylvanians believe vaping and e-cigarettes pose a âmajor riskâ to public health in the Keystone State. 

"The much publicized increase in the number of vaping-related illnesses, particularly among young people, has likely contributed to a greater understanding of the health risks associated with vaping and e-cigarettes," says Muhlenberg's Director of Public Health Chrysan Cronin. "In addition, many people may have a personal connection to someone who has suffered from a vaping-related illness so they may be more aware of the health risks."


For the second year in a row, most residents of the Commonwealth (51%) believe climate change poses a major risk to public health in Pennsylvania.

Methodological Statement
The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 420 adults in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between March 2 and 16, 2020. Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (83) and cell phones (337). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income and educational attainment to reflect those Pennsylvania population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2019. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult Pennsylvanians, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 8%. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument was designed by Christopher P. Borick, Director of the MCIPO and Professor in the Public Health Program, in conjunction with students in the Public Health Program at Muhlenberg College. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

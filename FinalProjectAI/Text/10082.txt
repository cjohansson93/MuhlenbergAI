Teaching Interests
American literature is my thing, 20th Century American poetry is my field. However, my teaching interests are broad. As well as teaching 19th and 20th Century American literature (both poetry and prose) I have taught  African-American literature. I teach courses on âThe Odysseyâ and on the tragic theatre from Athens through today and I enjoy teaching first year seminars. One of my primary goals is to help all my students become the best writers they can be and that includes creative writing. 
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsI have advised and tutored many, many, senior theses, mostly on 20th Century American poetry.
I am an active Ezra Pound scholar having written several books on the problematic poet, as well as his friends and antagonists William Carlos Williams and Hilda Doolittle (H.D.) I am an active reviewer of books on poetry. The senior seminars I have taught (Pound, Williams and H.D., Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes), the plays of W.B. Yeats, the political evolution of Adrienne Rich and on the African-American poet Jay Wright, reflect a broad interest in poetry, history and politics. I write poetry and follow baseball pretty closely.

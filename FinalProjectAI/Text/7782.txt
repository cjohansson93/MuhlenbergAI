Men's Soccer Ends Regular Season with Golden Goal
 Saturday, November 1, 2014 - page 2







					 





Senior Joey Roberts provided the game-winning goal for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team with just 3:29 remaining in the final overtime for a 1-0 Senior Night win against Ursinus.

Roberts rolled a goal into the left side of the net, squeezing the ball just inside the post off a pass from fellow senior Travis Wantchekon.

“It is pretty bittersweet,” said Roberts (left) about scoring the winning goal in his last regular-season home game. “But there is a lot more on our minds as far as the future.”

That future is a Centennial Conference semifinal matchup with Dickinson in exactly one week. The present is the end of a 2014 season that saw the Mules (12-1-2, 7-1-1) go undefeated at home (10-0-1) for only the third time since 1980, and marked the first time they won double-digit games at home since 2003. The historic regular season was not lost on Roberts.

“It means everything,” he said. “Since I’ve been here we always talked about how we never wanted to lose at home.”

Senior Danny Pinto made five saves en route to his seventh shutout of the season.

None of the other three Muhlenberg teams who ended their regular season had success, but the good news for all of them is
that their seasons will continue in the CC playoffs.

Women’s soccer nearly had a storybook Senior Day ending, as senior
Audrey Zamichow scored her fourth career goal to give Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead with 25 minutes to play.

But Ursinus (9-6-2, 6-2-2) tied the game with less than eight minutes to play in regulation, then scored the winning
goal 1:31 into overtime to clinch the third seed in the CC playoffs. The Mules (11-5-2, 6-4) dropped to the fourth
seed and will host Swarthmore in a first-round game for the second time in three years.

Field hockey ran into a buzzsaw in sixth-ranked Ursinus, which completed a 
perfect CC regular season with a 7-0 win. The Mules (12-4, 7-3), who had not lost a game by more than one goal all season,
did not have their playoff picture impacted by the loss; they will face Franklin & Marshall in a semifinal game.

Volleyball dropped a pair of non-conference matches, losing in four sets to
regionally ranked Stevenson and in three to Lynchburg. The Mules (24-7) did clinch a first-round bye, however, when 
Haverford defeated Swarthmore to earn the top seed for the playoffs. Muhlenberg will face Swarthmore in a semifinal match.

Senior Nikki Dickson recorded three aces in the Stevenson match to break the school record of 69 in a season.

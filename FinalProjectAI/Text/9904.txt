  Michelle Rossi, Class of 2013
When Michelle Rossi entered Muhlenberg, she thought she would major in Biology and minor in Music. She found a home in the Music Department and realized she could earn both her Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts. “Music was a perfect contrast to my biology studies. I was sold on earning a dual degree.” Read more about Michelle's experience

  Gillian Irwin, Class of 2013
“The best thing about Muhlenberg’s Music department—which is really the best thing about all of Muhlenberg—is the relationships students can develop with faculty members; even better, those relationships often spring from or connect to activities outside of class...." Read more about Gillian's experience

faust earns all-america honor



Junior Alex Faust of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team finished seventh in the pole vault at the NCAA Division III Championships, earning All-America
status.

Faust cleared 12 feet, 6¼ inches, tying the school record she set at Swarthmore last Monday. Only three other competitors vaulted higher. Faust tied three others
at the height but took the most attempts to get there. She made the last two heights on her third and final try.

Faust is the second All-American in the history of the Mule women’s program, matching Sarah Mitchell’s seventh-place finish in the javelin in 2006. She also 
is the first Muhlenberg non-senior, male or female, to earn All-America track and field honors in an individual event; several have done it as part of a relay team.

“I placed what I was seeded, so I’m very happy,” said Faust, who finished 13th at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March. “Indoor gave me the
experience, and now I’m better prepared. It helped because I was seeing the same girls; there were a lot of familiar faces.”

Muhlenberg’s other NCAA qualifier, graduated senior David Chorney, finished 12th in the steeplechase.

Businesses and government agencies rely on big data to succeed and better serve their customers and communities. Learn how to find the patterns from the past, understand the present, and envision the future using data.
The MASTER'S IN APPLIED ANALYTICS (MAA) prepares graduates to go beyond data management and governance and develop the data analytics skills necessary to address a wide range of operational contexts.   
Through a grounding in statistical analysis and data applications, students learn to find critical patterns within datasets, create descriptive data summaries and visualizations, and effectively communicate results. Students refine their skills through team projects and a range of problem-solving contexts, from urban analytics, urban simulation and geodemographics, to predictive analytics and population health, sustainability analytics, and epidemiology.
Students complete the MAA in two years, taking two course units per semester in Fall, Spring and Summer terms for a total of 12 course units.

Defenseman John DeLuca of the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team received honorable mention on the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-America
team for the second year in a row.

The first two-time All-American in program history, DeLuca led the Mules with 19 caused turnovers, tied for the team lead with 34 ground balls and contributed to the 
offense with two goals and two assists. He finished his career with 94 ground balls and 12 goals.

The All-America nod is the fourth overall for DeLuca, who graduated from Muhlenberg on Sunday. In addition to his two lacrosse honors, he was named an All-American and an Academic All-American as a running back
for the Mule football team in the fall. He is the first athlete in College history to earn All-America honors in two different sports in the same academic year.

DeLuca also was selected to play in the USILA North/South Senior All-Star Game, which is scheduled for Friday at 2:00 at Harvard Stadium in Cambridge, Mass. He was one
of 30 players chosen for the South squad.

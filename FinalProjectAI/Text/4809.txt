baseball to play for playoff berth



Women’s Tennis Loses to Another Ranked Team; Women’s Golf Sends Three to Gettysburg



The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team was shut out by The College of New Jersey for its seventh straight loss.

The Lions are ranked 23rd in the latest Division III poll. All three of the Mules’s non-conference losses are to nationally ranked teams
(the others being No. 16 Mary Washington and No. 22 Vassar), and they have also lost to No. 13 Johns Hopkins, a Centennial Conference rival.

Junior Caitie Druker played a close 6-4, 7-5 match against the No. 2-ranked singles player in the Northeast Region.

Three members of the Muhlenberg women’s golf team competed in the two-day Gettysburg Invitational. Sophomore Amanda Heiberger led the
Mule trio with a 36-hole score of 226, nine strokes ahead of junior Amy Venuto.

The Muhlenberg baseball team will either be the last team in the Centennial Conference playoffs or the last team out, and they won’t need help
from anyone.

Haverford beat Franklin & Marshall, 5-4, to eliminate the Diplomats from playoff contention. Johns Hopkins (16-0 CC), Haverford (12-4) and Swarthmore (10-6) have clinched
berths, leaving Washington (9-7) and Muhlenberg (8-8) to contend for the fourth and final playoff spot.

And contend they will: The Shoremen visit Cedarcreek Field on Saturday for what is essentially a playoff-qualifying doubleheader. The Mules are in the
position of a team that won the consolation bracket in a double-elimination tournament; they need to win two games against Washington to make the
playoffs. Washington needs just one win to clinch its first playoff berth since the CC went to a postseason tournament in 2002.

Muhlenberg has been in the CC playoff field three times, most recently in 2008.

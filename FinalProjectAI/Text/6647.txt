Pitching Carries Baseball to Split in Florida
 Friday, March 8, 2013 - page 2







					 


After averaging nearly 13 runs in its first four wins in Florida, the Muhlenberg baseball team showed that it could rely on its pitching to win too.




Lawsky has a 1.89 ERA in three starts and is holding opponents to a .208 batting average.



Sophomore Matthew Lawsky and senior Ryan Rechten combined on a three-hitter as the Mules defeated Northwestern (Minn.), 4-1, to gain a split on the second-to-last day of their Spring Break trip.

Muhlenberg (7-3) also got some good pitching in its first game of the day but lost to Marywood, 5-2. The split clinched a winning trip for the Mules.

Lawsky pitched the first eight innings, allowing only two hits and no earned runs while striking out six, to improve to 3-0 on the season. He faced only five batters over the minimum during his outing and did not allow a hit over his final three innings.

Rechten worked around a leadoff single in the ninth to earn his ninth career save. 

On offense, Muhlenberg got RBI singles from junior Brett Rosen in the second, senior John Muha in the fourth and senior Joseph Vila in the seventh. Another run scored on a passed ball.

In the opening game, junior Pat Doolittle and sophomore Nick Gies combined on a three-hitter, but four Mule errors led to four unearned runs. Gies pitched 4 2/3 innings of hitless relief.

Although Muhlenberg had 13 hits, it could plate only two runs, both scored by Muha. Vila and junior Nick Kennedy recorded two hits and an RBI apiece, and sophomore Kurt Johnson went 3-for-4.

Track and field gets first medalon day one of home championship meet



Not even a little rain delay could keep the Muhlenberg track and field team from medaling on the opening day of the Centennial Conference Championships, which are being held at Scotty Wood Stadium.

Sophomore Ryan Hellings was the first Mule to earn some hardware after tying for third in the pole vault, which was halted temporarily while a quick shower passed through the area. 

He was one of four competitors that cleared 12 feet, 10.5 inches, but was one of only two to do it on the first try. It was the third time Hellings (right) has medaled in the pole vault at a championship meet.

On the women's side, freshman Erin Saucier just missed out on a medal, finishing in fourth. The second through fourth place finishers all cleared 10 feet, 4 inches, but Saucier was the only one that needed all three attempts.

In the multi-events, junior Michael Baer is in third place in a very tight decathlon. He is only 11 points off the lead with five events remaining. Sophomore Tara Keegan is also in third place after four events in the heptathlon.

The action picks up tomorrow with Mule athletes competing in 20 of the 22 scheduled events.

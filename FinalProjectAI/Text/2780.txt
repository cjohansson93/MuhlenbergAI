faust extends cc dominance



For the sixth time in six tries, junior Alex Faust of the Muhlenberg track and field team won the pole vault at the Centennial Conference
Championships.

Faust was one of three Mule women to place in the pole vault on the first day of competition at the CC outdoor meet, hosted by Franklin & Marshall.
The 10,000 was the only other event to be completed.

Faust’s winning vault of 12-½ broke her own meet record of 11-1¾ set last year. She hit the NCAA provisional mark for the third time
this year and won by nearly two feet.

Sophomore Lindsey Weidmann finished sixth in the pole vault, and freshman Melissa Miller tied for eighth.

Trio of Pitchers Combine on Six-Hitter as Baseball Extends Streak

Freshman Chris Manfredonia tags out a Wilmington runner attempting to steal in the sixth.



This year’s Spring Break trip is a complete reversal for the Muhlenberg baseball team, which went 0-10 in Florida last year. And one of the Mules’ pitchers has done a 180 from his first start of the trip to his second.




Velys has not allowed an earned run in four appearances this season.



Junior Billy Rogers worked into the eighth inning and did not allow an earned run as Muhlenberg won its fourth straight, 3-1 against Wilmington. 
The Mules are 5-1 in Florida and 8-1 on the season – their best start since 1928.


In his last start, against Widener on Saturday, Rogers allowed four 


runs in the first inning and left during an 11-run second in what would become a 21-6 loss. This time he was much sharper. 

Wilmington scored an unearned run in the first and was blanked after that. The Quakers (3-3) got only two runners past first base from the second inning until Rogers left in the eighth. He faced the minimum nine batters in the fifth, sixth and seventh and finished allowing six hits with five strikeouts and just one walk in 7.1 innings.

Junior Tim Velys relieved Rogers in the eighth with two runners on and retired both batters he faced on ground balls. Junior Ryan Rechten worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his third save in as many chances.

After hitting double digits in runs in six of its first seven wins, the offense was quieter but still came through with clutch hits. A two-out double by sophomore Nick Kennedy brought home freshman Jimmy Cody, who had singled and stolen second, to tie the score in the third.

In the sixth, sophomore John Scuderi led off with a single, was sacrificed to second and scored the go-ahead run on a double by junior Joseph Vila. Muhlenberg added an insurance run in the seventh, with Cody reaching on an error and eventually scoring on a double play.

Senior Nick Busillo went 2-for-4, raising his average to .382.

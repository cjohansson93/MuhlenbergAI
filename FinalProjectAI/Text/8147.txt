This event, funded by the Charles A. and Leona K. Gruber Lectureship in the Arts, will begin with an interactive workshop at 7 p.m., followed by a concert of traditional and modern works.  Both the concert and the workshop are free and open to the public.
Based in New York City, Gamelan Dharma Swara is one of the most highly regarded gamelan ensembles outside of Indonesia.  The group is comprised of various metallic gongs and xylophone-like instruments as well as an assortment of flutes and drums. In Java and Bali, gamelan is the musical background to every social and cultural gathering
The ensemble studies and performs music for the 7-tone gamelan semara dana and the 5-tone gender wayang. Their repertoire includes a wide variety of classic lelambatan, semar pegulingan saih pitu, kebyar and various pelegongan dance works as well as new instrumental works composed by Balinese composers and Gamelan Dharma Swara members.

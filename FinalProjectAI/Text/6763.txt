Women's Basketball Scores 100 in Last Home Test of Semester
 Wednesday, December 5, 2012 - page 2







					 


If the members of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team get the same score on their final exams as they did in their last home game before finals, it will be a very happy holiday break.




Santone has blocked 10 shots in only 32 minutes of playing time this season.



The Mules shot 56.9 percent and breezed to their third straight win, 100-34 against Bryn Mawr. It was the 14th time in program history that they hit the century mark, the second straight year against the Owls. 

Subbing in players five at a time every five minutes for most of the game, Muhlenberg (5-2, 3-1) got points from all but one of its 14 healthy players. Only one Mule played more than 21 minutes, and five got their first career starts.

The first-time starters were very impressive. Sophomore Leanna Tallamy scored a game-high 18 points on 8-of-9 shooting, sophomore Emily Lesher netted 12 points, freshman Jordan Labbe had eight assists, and sophomore Abby Stenger, who sees regular time in the team’s rotation, contributed five points, four rebounds and two assists.

But none made more of splash than freshman Christina Santone, who had played only about 30 seconds since the first game of the season. The 6-foot-2 center scored 16 points, pulled down seven rebounds and set a school record with seven blocked shots.




Muhlenberg didn't miss many shots but frequently got a second chance when it did, grabbing 20 out of a possible 35 live-ball offensive rebounds. Here, Zabrecky and
junior Katy Mitton go up for an offensive rebound in the first half.



“I was very nervous but very anxious, and I got more excited as it got closer,” said Santone of her first start. “I think I did very well.”

Although Santone put her name in the record book with her blocks, erasing a mark originally set 25 years ago and matched four times since, her biggest highlights were a pair of steals, one in each half, in which she intercepted a pass in the frontcourt and dribbled the length for a layup.

“It was the best experience! It was great to hear everyone screaming for me,” said Santone, who got fouled on the second layup and completed the three-point play. “I’m very happy I made it to the other end of the court and was able to finish.”

Muhlenberg, which has never lost to Bryn Mawr in 36 all-time meetings, jumped out to a 13-1 lead and held a 45-17 advantage at the break. The Owls (1-6, 0-5) made just five field goals in the first 20 minutes, while the Mules shot 50 percent from the field.

 The Mules, and in particular senior Alita Zabrecky, kept up their offensive ways at the start of the second half. Two days after junior Erin Laney scored Muhlenberg’s first 10 points of the game, Zabrecky netted Muhlenberg’s first 10 points of the second half. She finished with 16 points in only 14 minutes, increasing her career total to 965.

Muhlenberg closed the game by making six of its final seven shots, with Tallamy hitting a baseline jumper with 29.4 ticks left to get the score to triple digits. The 34 points were the fewest allowed by the Mules in a game in which they scored 100.

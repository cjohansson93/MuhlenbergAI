Jonah Adamcik â20, a religion studies and political science major, has taken summer classes for the past three years.
As the spring semester draws to a close, college students everywhere begin to plan for the months ahead. For some, work or travel schedules begin to take shape. But many enterprising students seek an alternative optionâregistering for summer study classes at Muhlenberg College. 
Full-time Muhlenberg and Wescoe School students, veterans and military personnel, visiting college students and high school students looking to earn early college credits  may enroll in up to four courses, offered in five sessions, throughout the summer (no more than two courses per session). Session I begins May 22 and enrollment is open now. Classes are taught on the Collegeâs campus or through expanded online options.
Jonah Adamcik â20, a religion studies and political science major at Muhlenberg College, has taken summer classes for the past three years. âThis is a perfect time to get ahead,â says Adamcik. âThe summer sessions are shorter compared to the typical fall or spring semester, but it never feels rushed.â 
A growing number of summer online and blended courses are also available for those who would prefer a more flexible schedule or who prefer to spend the summer at home.
âMy first summer at Muhlenberg, I took Animals & The Sacred, an online class taught by William Gruen, associate professor of religion studies and chair of the department,â says Adamcik. âThe relaxed nature of the campus really made it feel like we were a group of friends diving into a topic of mutual interest as opposed to people trying to take a class for general credit.â
The Collegeâs digital learning program has been nationally recognized. In an article about institutional innovation, Inside Higher Ed highlighted Muhlenbergâs efforts to expand online learning while still emphasizing close collaboration between students and professors. The Collegeâs online course development process was cited by The Chronicle of Higher Education and ensures that each digital and blended course is intentionally small and specifically designed for its students. 
Full-time Muhlenberg students should consult with their advisors prior to enrolling. Visiting students should consult with their college or university advisors to confirm transfer credits eligibility.
Visit the Summer Study website for course availability and registration, or call the Wescoe School/summer study office at 484-664-3300.

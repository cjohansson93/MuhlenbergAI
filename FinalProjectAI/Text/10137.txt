Frequently Asked Questions
Muhlenberg College is committed to keeping all participants, their families and friends healthy and safe. All new information will be posted to this website as soon as it is made available to the campus community.

Where and when will Commencement be held?The Class of 2022 will gather for the 174th Commencement ceremony at the PPL Center in Allentown on Sunday, May 22, 2022. The ceremony will begin at 10 a.m.

Is transportation to the PPL Center provided for the graduates? How do I get there?No, each graduate is responsible for providing their own transportation. Graduates and guests will need to arrange transportation and parking. The PPL Center website has information on directions and parking.

When should students and guests arrive at the PPL Center?Students may begin to arrive at the PPL Center for the 10 a.m. ceremony at 8:30 a.m. and must be present no later than 9:30 a.m. 
Detailed instructions will be sent to seniors and families for guest arrival and ticketing.



Will guests be allowed to attend?Yes. Each graduate will receive 10 general admission guest tickets; these tickets will be distributed to the graduate electronically by the PPL Center. Graduates are responsible for distributing their allotment of tickets to their guests.
What if a graduate needs more than 10 tickets?Unfortunately the College is limited to issuing 10 general admission tickets per student given the capacity of the PPL Center for our ceremony. However, students are free to distribute or share those tickets as they wish. The College anticipates that the tickets will come directly from PPL Center to students and that the College will not have any ability to distribute, share or reallocate tickets.
When will tickets be distributed?General admissions tickets will be distributed by the PPL Center to graduates' Muhlenberg email adress in early May.
What are graduates, faculty, staff and guests permitted to bring into the PPL Center?Guests will not be allowed to bring the following or similar items into the arena:

Outside food or beverages
Flowers (while guests are not permitted to bring in flowers, flowers will be available for purchase) 
Balloons, wrapped packages, whistles or other noisemakers
Signs or banners larger than 24âx36â
Guests may only bring clear bags into the arena. This includes camera bags, purses and other bags.

Are there ADA seats available?Yes. The PPL Center is a fully acessible venue. Adequate ADA seating is available on the main concourse around the arena on a first come, first serve basis. If you need accessibility accommodations, seek out PPL staff or Muhlenberg volunteers at the entrance and inform them of your needs.
 
What other accessibility accomodations are available?
Sign language interpreters will be present at the ceremony. Guests needing to rent wheelchairs or other medical devices can do so from a nearby facility, such as St. Luke's Allentown campus. Please contact communications@muhlenberg.edu or call 484-664-3230 for more information on accessibility.
 
Will there be restrictions in place at the ceremony (e.g., masking, proof of vaccination, etc.)?At this point in time, Muhlenberg and the PPL Center are unable to definitively state whether there will be restrictions on attendees at the May 22 Commencement ceremony. Any specific rules or regulations will be communicated to seniors and their guests later in the Spring 2022 semester. Please check this FAQ for any additional updates as the event approaches.
What happens if it rains?Commencement ceremonies will be held at the PPL Center, rain or shine.

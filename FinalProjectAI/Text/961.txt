UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH ON THE MOLECULAR GENETICS OF ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT
 




 

Laboratory of Bruce Wightman, Biology Department
New Science Building 221
Our laboratory is studying the mechanisms of animal development, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. We perform experiments that include Mendelian genetic, molecular genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches. Research students in our lab learn valuable technologies, help design experiments, interpret data, publish papers and attend scientific conferences.








The nuclear hormone receptors are a class of evolutionarily-conserved proteins that regulate transcription of other genes in all known animals, from coral to humans. In a variety of species, nuclear hormone receptors play critical roles in physiology and development. For example, the androgen receptors mediate male sex development, estrogen receptors function in female physiology, and ecdysone receptors control insect morphogenesis. Many, but not all, nuclear receptors are activated in response to small lipophilic hormones, such as estrogen. The small soil-dwelling roundworm C. elegans, like other nematodes, has seen an explosion in the number and variety of nuclear receptors. While humans have only 48 nuclear receptors, C. elegans has over 270. Our lab is focused on the NR2E class of nuclear receptors. In vertebrates, two genes of this class have been studied: PNR (NR2E3), which functions in the development of rod and cone photoreceptor neurons in human retina, and tailless, which functions in the development of adult neural stem cells and limbic system in mice. We are studying the C. elegans versions of these genes: fax-1 (PNR), nhr-67 (tailless), nhr-111 (worm-specific), and nhr-239 (found in most animals except vertebrates). Each nuclear receptor has two important parts (domains) in the protein: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is the part that binds to DNA in the promoter of other genes, and the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is the part that binds a hormone (if there is one) and mediates changes in the rate of transcription of genes that a regulated by the nuclear receptor. In contrast to the DBD, where amino acid sequence is very similar in worms, flies and humans, the sequence of the LBD is very different in worms as compared to other species. Furthermore, our lab showed that the LBD is not required for some functions, suggesting that C. elegans nuclear receptors may sometimes be ligand-independent.

CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS




âFunction of fax-1 in neuronal control of developmental progression and sleep
âThe FAX-1 nuclear receptor of C. elegans functions in neuron identity and is orthologous to vertebrate PNR nuclear receptor (NR2E3). In humans, mutations in PNR lead to defects in photoreceptor development and subsequent retinal degeneration. fax-1 mutants exhibit a slow growth phenotype, which is a result of a defect in execution of the L1 transition.  Newly hatched C. elegans larvae (L1s) make a developmental decision to either initiate growth or arrest development, based on whether or not food is available.  Arrested L1 animals then resume growth once in the presence of food. fax-1 mutants undergo a temporary L1 arrest when hatching in the presence of food, likely a consequence of fax-1 function in the nervous system. Combining fax-1 or unc-42 (a different type of transcription factor) mutations with a mutation in daf-2 insulin receptor causes all animals to arrest just before hatching or as newly-hatched L1 animals. These animals are asleep! Mutations in a gene required for sleep can reverse the arrest. This has led us to propose the existence of a wake-promoting neural pathway that is involved in insulin-signaling and depends on fax-1 and unc-42- expressing neurons. 












The function of nhr-67/tailless in uterus development and posterior pattern formation
In Drosophila, the tailless nuclear receptor functions in orchestrating the patterning of the embryonic termini-- heads and tails. We have genetic evidence that suggests that the nematode equivalent, nhr-67, functions in posterior pattern formation in the embryo, similar to Drosophila. We have also found that nhr-67 plays a key role in regulating the post-embryonic development of the C. elegans uterus. Our current work on this project is focused on placing the function of the nhr-67 gene in the Notch-based signaling pathway that directs formation of the ventral uterus. Understanding the Notch pathway has implications for understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer Disease: a gene called sel-12 may function upstream of nhr-67. Mutations in a human equivalent of sel-12 lead to an inherited form of Alzheimer Disease. In mice and flies, tailless plays a key role in the development of the brain. Mice that are born with mutations in tailless have a severe loss of limbic system neurons and are hyper-aggressive. Other studies have shown that tailless functions in regulating the differentiation of neural stem cells.The function of unstudied related nuclear receptorsThe nhr-111 and nhr-239 gense are related to fax-1 and more loosely to the other NR2E genes. While C. elegans has an nhr-111 gene, the closely-related nematode C. briggsae does not. Our study of nhr-111 provides an opportunity to study the evolution of nuclear receptor function in species-specific development or behavior. Data suggest that nhr-111 may function as an important regulator of genes that function in metabolism. In contrast, nhr-239 appears to be weakly-conserved in non-vertebrate animals. Mutations in nhr-111 and nhr-239 do not cause dramatic, obvious phenotypes (death, sterility, major developmental defects). A deletion that removes the first exon and promoter of nhr-239 causes an interesting behavioral defect: worms avoid large concentrations of bacteria, suggesting they may be responding adversely to low oxygen environments.

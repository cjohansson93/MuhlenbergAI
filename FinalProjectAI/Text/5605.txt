Women’s lacrosse survives scare from drew 


The members of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team realized that 



Senior Marissa Capuano scored the Mules’ ninth goal and recorded a game-high three caused turnovers.



no lead is big enough to guarantee them a victory if they don’t play hard until the final whistle.

Luckily for the Mules, they embraced that idea quickly en route to an 18-11 victory against visiting Drew.

Having established a comfortable 11-2 cushion at halftime, Muhlenberg had 


Men’s Lax Fall to Fords



For the second time in three games against nationally ranked Centennial Conference teams, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team held a second-half lead. But No. 8 Haverford went on a five-goal run and went on to defeat the Mules, 14-9.

An even first half ended with the teams tied at 5-5. Two minutes into the third quarter, freshman Brent Siebold scored a man-up goal, assisted by sophomore Paul Munday, to put Muhlenberg up, 6-5. The Fords (6-1, 1-1) won the ensuing faceoff and scored the tying goal just six seconds later, then put in four more before time ran out in the quarter, taking a 10-6 edge into the final 15 minutes.

Munday’s goal 33 seconds into the fourth made it 10-7, but that was as close as the Mules would get.

Senior Mike Brown scored three goals for his first career hat trick.

Muhlenberg (2-4, 0-3) is done with its brutal opening CC slate of No. 5 Washington, No. 2 Gettysburg and the Fords and will begin the non-ranked portion of its league schedule with a home game against Swarthmore on Saturday.

to weather a fierce second-half effort by the Rangers, who scored seven straight goals 
to open the second period and come within two, 11-9.

The Mules, who stayed cold for over 18 minutes, desperately needed a goal to break Drew’s momentum and it finally came when junior Sara Hiller connected 
on a Taylor Armstrong pass to bring her team the vital relief.

“The goal brought us back our composure, which we had lost in the beginning of the second half,” said Hiller. “It was an important game-changing goal.” 

A rare incident happened while Hiller was scoring the goal as she was checked across the face by Drew’s goalkeeper, who got a yellow card and was sidelined for three minutes. 

With resurrected confidence, the Mules netted six of the next eight goals to put the game out of reach and claim their 21st consecutive success against 
non-conference opposition. 

“We proved that we can come back and fight back at any time,” Hiller said. “We showed that we never give up.”

During the dry stretch at the beginning of the second half, the Mules were able to organize only one attack as the 
Rangers dominated the draw controls. In the second period, Drew recorded 11 draw controls, while Muhlenberg won only six.

However, the Mules demonstrated again their accurate shooting, converting 56 percent of their shot attempts (18-of-32). 

Sophomore Amanda McGovern scored four goals for second time in her career, while Alyssa Bascelli and Hiller contributed a hat trick apiece. 
Besides converting all three of her shots into goals, Bascelli also added a team-leading four ground balls, two assists and two caused turnovers.

Armstrong tallied team-high six points on two goals and four assists, and junior Ruth Morrongiello finished with five points (two goals and three assists).

The game marked the first time Muhlenberg recorded back-to-back wins against Drew in the 24-year-old rivalry between the two teams. 
Two years ago, the Mules claimed a 10-8 success at home.

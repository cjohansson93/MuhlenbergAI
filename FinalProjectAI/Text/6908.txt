Baseball Splits After Historic Opening Win
 Tuesday, March 5, 2013 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg baseball team made some history on its third day of games in Florida.

The Mules defeated Geneva, 11-2, in the first game of a doubleheader, for their third straight win in the Sunshine State. The first
two were against Martin Luther (16-2) and Lebanon Valley (12-2). It was the first time in program history that Muhlenberg scored in
double digits and allowed two or fewer runs in three consecutive games.

Not even the famed undefeated 1928 squad, which outscored its 11 opponents by a 115-39 margin, pulled off the feat.

The streak, and the Mules’ winning streak, ended in the nightcap when Geneva scored twice in the top of the seventh for a 6-4 win.

Sophomore David Anderson (left) earned the win in his first career start in the opener, allowing five hits and striking out four in
four innings. He and two relievers (including sophomore Nick Gies, who struck out all three batters he faced to end the game) were
backed by a 14-hit attack.

Senior John Muha, batting leadoff, played the role of table-setter perfectly, going 3-for-4 with five runs scored – one short of the school
record. He walked to lead off the game and scored on a two-out double by Nick Plinio, one of three run-scoring hits for the sophomore
in the game.

Sophomore Jimmy Cody also drove in three runs with a pair of two-out extra-base hits, an RBI double in the second and a two-run triple in the
seventh. Sophomore Danny Usewick, making his first start of the season, went 3-for-4 with three runs scored.

In the second game, Muhlenberg (5-2) fell into an early 3-0 but rallied to tie the score with three in the bottom of the fifth. Muha and Cody were in the middle
of the rally with back-to-back singles, and junior Nick Kennedy brought home the tying run with a sacrifice fly.

After the Golden Tornadoes (3-3) went back in front with a run in the sixth, the Mules came back again to tie the score on a two-out, two-strike single by
sophomore Kurt Johnson. Muhlenberg got the tying runs on base in the bottom of the seventh, but the final two hitters were retired.

Tineke DâHaeseleer Assistant Professor of HistoryEttinger 300A484-664-3324
 
Education:
PhD in Chinese Studies, University of Cambridge, UKBA and MA in Sinology, KU Leuven, Belgium
I am a historian of premodern China, with a particular interest in medieval Chinaâs foreign relations. My current research project is based on my doctoral dissertation and traces the development of the Sinosphere in the first millennium, when the foundations were laid for what we now know as âEast Asiaâ.
The courses I teach cover modern and premodern China, Japan and Korea. In addition to survey courses tracing traditions and transformations in East Asia, I teach courses on cultural history, and foreign relations, and I look forward to developing new courses in history and memory, gender, and material culture, among other topics. In all my courses we work intensively with primary source materials (in translation), and use discussion and group work to come to a better understanding of East Asian culture and history.

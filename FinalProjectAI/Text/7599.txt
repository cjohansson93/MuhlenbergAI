Women's Basketball Posts 30-Point Win in CC Opener
 Wednesday, November 19, 2014







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team had its best offensive output in two years, but it was the defense that stood out in its conference-opening 95-65 win over Swarthmore.


The Mules caused chaos in the backcourt with a strong man-to-man fullcourt press the entire game. 
“Our key was to keep the pressure on them,” said senior Leanna Tallamy. “We wanted to keep it up and turn them over in the fullcourt press.”

Tallamy led the way for the Mules (1-1, 1-0), recording her second double-double of the season with 25 points and 11 rebounds. She was also one of the many Mules who made inbounding after a score for the Garnet extremely difficult, while senior Hannah Rush (right) led the guards who continued the pressure all the way down the court if the pass got through, making getting the ball to halfcourt tough for Swarthmore (1-2, 0-1) the whole contest.

Muhlenberg led coast to coast, and once the Garnet went cold from the outside, the Mules never looked back.



“We wanted to come out and show we were a better team than we showed in the first game [a 61-60 loss to Moravian], ” added Tallamy. “We shot a lot better and carried it through the game. We just had a really good game tonight.”

It was just a 22-19 game more than halfway through the first half, but the Garnet never got any closer the rest of the way. Muhlenberg used a 17-4 run towards the end of the first half to take a 47-32 lead at the break. Tallamy scored 12 of her 18 first-half points during that stretch.

Junior Christina Santone scored 11 points and had four rebounds, while senior Laura Gregory added 10 points, six boards and four assists. In total, eight Mules scored at least six points, and everyone on the roster who was suited up played at least five minutes.

“We have a lot of depth,” continued Tallamy. “It is really great going into the season knowing we have a deep bench.”

The 30-point victory is a far cry from the two games these Centennial foes played against each other last year. The teams split their contests, with Muhlenberg taking the first by one point in overtime and the Garnet grabbing the second game by five. The win starts the Mules off on the right foot in conference play. 

“It is great to get that first win in conference,” finished Tallamy. “Especially a win like this.”

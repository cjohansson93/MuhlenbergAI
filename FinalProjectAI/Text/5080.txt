Antonini selected as player of the week


Sophomore Cody Antonini of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was honored as offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Antonini scored the game-winning goal in the 83rd minute of the Mules’ 1-0 victory at Gettysburg on Saturday night. The midfielder fired a left-footed shot off a defender and into the back of the net off a free kick to put Muhlenberg ahead late.

The goal was Antonini’s eighth of the season in just seven games. He entered the week as one of only 24 players in Division III averaging more than a goal per game, and with a goal in all seven games this year he is just one off the school record for consecutive games scored in to start a season.

The victory kept the Mules tied for first place in the CC at a perfect 2-0. Muhlenberg has a tough stretch of games this week, as it will face two nationally ranked opponents in back-to-back games for the first time since 2004. The Mules will take on Dickinson (ranked No. 12 by D3soccer.com entering last week) on Wednesday night and Johns Hopkins (No. 18) on Saturday night. Both squads are likely to move up in the rankings after topping the No. 3 and No. 2 teams in the country, respectively.

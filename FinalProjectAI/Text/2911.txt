floyd named to academic all-america first team


Senior defensive lineman Jake Floyd of the Muhlenberg football team was selected to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-America College Division first team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America.

Floyd is only the sixth Mule football player to earn first-team Academic All-America honors, and the first since Mike Hoffman in 1990. In fact, since Hoffman,
only three other Muhlenberg athletes in any sport were first-team Academic All-Americans, the most recent being Jason Finkelstein in cross country/track
and field in 2006. 

A second-team selection last year,
Floyd is the fifth Mule football player to be named to the Academic All-America team more than once. 

A finance major and double minor in political  science and entrepreneurial studies, Floyd is served as a team captain in 2009 and received All-Centennial
Conference honorable mention. He led Muhlenberg in sacks (7) and tackles for loss (12½), ranking third in the CC in both categories, while playing for a unit that ranks 15th in Division III in
total defense, 21st in rushing defense and 25th in scoring defense.

Floyd was a key contributor on back-to-back CC championship teams that were ranked in the top 20 in Division III in 2007 and 2008.
He was fifth in CC in tackles for loss in 2008.

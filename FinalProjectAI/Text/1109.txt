Many members of our community are working and learning remotely during the world's COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the following images of campus may be of use for Mules who would like to make use of virtual background options in web conferencing software.
Desktop users may right click and save any of the images below. Phone and tablet users may long-press on an image to save it to their device.
For instructions on how to use virtual backgrounds with Zoom conferencing software, visit the provider's website.

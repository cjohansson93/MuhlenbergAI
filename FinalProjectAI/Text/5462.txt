Mule Duo Wins ITA Draw


For the second time in as many tournaments, sophomores Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt of the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team won their draw.

The Mule duo captured the doubles blue draw at the ITA Southeast Regional, hosted by Mary Washington. They won their first three matches in the 32-team field, then advanced through the semifinals and final by default.

Winston and Schmidt won the F&M Fall Invitational last weekend. Add in a victory in a dual match vs. Moravian, and the Muhlenberg sophs are 9-0 for the fall.

Both players also did well in singles competition, joining classmate Sara Sutker in the Round of 16 in the blue draw.

Two Muhlenberg men’s soccer players were honored by the Centennial Conference 


following a pair of wins.

Senior Steven Tenenzapf was named offensive player of the week. He figured in all three goals in a 3-0 shutout of regionally ranked Gettysburg, scoring the first two – matching his career total entering the game – and assisting on the third.

Sophomore Matthew Cecconi (left) was named defensive player of the week. His play on the back line was instrumental in shutout victories against Elizabethtown and Gettysburg.  The Mules allowed only three shots on goal in the two matches, extending their unscored-upon streak to 341 minutes.  Cecconi also gave the offense a boost, assisting on the first two goals vs. the Bullets.

One of two remaining undefeated teams in CC play (Johns Hopkins is the other), Muhlenberg (6-2 overall) has won four in a row and ranks second in the CC in goals-against average (0.75) and third in goals scored per game (2.00).

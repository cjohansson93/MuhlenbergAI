Women’s soccer wins 2-0, now 2-0 in CC



Football, Men’s Soccer Rise in Polls


The Muhlenberg football team is ranked in the top five in two Division III polls.

The 3-0 Mules remained at No. 5 in the D3football.com poll following Saturday’s 42-21 win against Gettysburg, and they moved up to No. 5 in the American Football Coaches Association rankings. 

Muhlenberg was No. 7 in the first AFCA poll of the season last week and leapfrogged Wabash after then-No. 6 Salisbury lost to Delaware Valley.

The four teams ahead of Muhlenberg are the same in both polls – Mt. Union, Wis.-Whitewater, Mary Hardin-Baylor and Capital, in that order.

In men’s soccer, Muhlenberg (6-2) jumped back into the Middle Atlantic regional rankings at No. 6 after shutout wins against Elizabethtown and Gettysburg.

The Mules were ranked sixth earlier this season, then dropped out for two weeks.

Three of the teams ranked higher (Johns Hopkins, Drew and Swarthmore) as well as one ranked lower (Dickinson) are scheduled Muhlenberg opponents in October.

In their first 16 meetings, 12 of the games between Muhlenberg’s and Haverford’s women’s soccer programs were decided by a single goal.

Well, the Mules have started a new trend – beating Haverford by more than one. Last year it was by three. This year the lucky number is two, as Muhlenberg shut out the Fords 2-0.

It looked like another close 



Ashley O’Grady and her teammates in the back helped limit the Fords to one shot on goal.



one as the first half ended with no score. Muhlenberg dominated the field, outshooting Haverford 10-3, and came close to scoring off a corner kick that freshman Nicolette Miller headed just over the net.

“We knew we needed to pick up the intensity,” said freshman Jamie Weiss, “and do what we’ve been doing in practice – play quickly, get to the outside, work with each other.”

Weiss found the back of the net 22:34 into the second half off a pass from Miller. Weiss walked the cross in for her second career goal.

Junior Kasey Hacker followed less than five minutes later, off a corner by sister Kimberly Hacker. Kimberly’s pass was dribbled by Kasey for about 10 yards before being launched into the upper right corner.

“We knew we had to want it,” said Kasey. “We had to have that intensity and push through the final buzzer.”

That push resulted in a 2-0 win against a Haverford team that made the Centennial Conference playoffs last year and lost 1-0 this year to the current No. 2 team in Division III (Lynchburg). The Mules (7-2, 2-0) now have four shutouts on the season and are one of three remaining undefeated teams in CC play.

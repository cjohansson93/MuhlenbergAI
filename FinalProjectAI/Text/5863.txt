VOLLEYBALL ACES FIRST DAY




CROSS COUNTRY OPENS WITH SHORT RACE



The Muhlenberg cross country teams opened their season with a non-scored 4K run against Lehigh Valley rivals DeSales and Lehigh. 

The women were led by senior Sara Gearin (sixth) and freshman Abby Simons (seventh). Muhlenberg’s second, third and fourth runners were freshmen.

On the men’s side, Muhlenberg was led by junior Timothy Van Syckle (fourth), junior David Chorney (sixth) and sophomore Patrick Thornton (10th). Five out of the next six runners were freshmen.

It didn’t take long for the Muhlenberg volleyball players to feel comfortable in their positions.

In the first 



Sophomore Phylicia Lee served most of the 30-3 game and rang up nine aces in the two matches.




game of the first match of the 2007 season, the 
Mule players spent most of the time at the same spot in a 30-3 victory against Alvernia at Moravian’s Greyhound Premiere Invitational.
Muhlenberg went on to win in three games and also swept SUNY Institute of Technology to win its pool and advance to the Championship Bracket. The Mules face Ithaca and
host Moravian in Saturday’s final round.

With a 30-8 win against SUNYIT in the first game of the second match, Muhlenberg recorded two of its three most decisive wins since the start of 30-point scoring in 2001. 
The Mules posted a 30-7 victory against Centenary last year.

Both opponents had trouble returning serves, as Muhlenberg registered 15 aces against Alvernia and 18 (two short of the school record) against SUNYIT. The resulting
short rallies meant few outstanding statistics in other categories.

Senior Jess Anselmi totalled a team-high 13 kills in the two matches, and junior Megan Eiser put down eight kills without an error vs. Alvernia.

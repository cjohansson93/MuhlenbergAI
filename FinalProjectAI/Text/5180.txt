softball earns second seed in cc playoffs



Baseball Ends CC Season with Split


Another impressive hitting display by senior Christian Conti highlighted the Muhlenberg baseball team’s last Centennial Conference doubleheader of the season, a split at Washington.

The Mules (15-21-1 overall) won the first game, 13-4, and dropped the nightcap, 5-3, to finish at 8-10 in the CC.

Conti hit for the cycle in the doubleheader, with a double and home run in the first game and a single and triple in the second. The home run, a solo shot in the third inning, was the 17th in his career, moving him into a tie for second place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list. The triple was his 18th. With two games left in his career, Conti has 53 extra-base hits, one short of tying the school record.

Junior Dan Fisher put his name in the record book, doubling as the second batter of Game 1 for his school-record 14th two-bagger of the season. The Mules tied a school record with seven doubles in the game, including two by sophomore Bobby Spindler.

Junior Phil Cresta worked into the sixth inning to move into a tie for third place on the program’s all-time list with his 16th career win.

The Muhlenberg softball team needed a sweep of Ursinus in its final doubleheader to win the Centennial Conference regular-season doubleheader and didn’t miss by much. The Bears won the first game, 1-0, and the Mules took the nightcap, 3-1.

As a result, Ursinus is the top seed and host for next 



Senior Samantha Crist, who was honored along with Ferrigno between games of the Senior Day twinbill, had a single, walk and stolen base.



weekend’s CC playoffs, and Muhlenberg is the second seed. The Mules will play Gettysburg in their first game of the double-elimination tournament.

Muhlenberg’s final CC record of 12-4 was its best since 2001, and its eight-game improvement from last year’s 4-12 mark tied for the best in league history, matching Haverford’s 2005-06 jump.

The Bears (28-8, 13-3) pushed across the lone run in the second inning of the opener. Batting against a pitcher who came in with a 0.78 ERA and nearly 300 strikeouts, the Mules (18-15 overall) went down 1-2-3 only twice. They advanced runners to third base in the second and seventh but could not push the tying run across.

Muhlenberg took advantage of Ursinus fielding mistakes to plate two early runs in Game 2. Senior RiRi Ferrigno knocked in the first with a two-out single in the 
first inning, and sophomore Alyssa Epstein scored the second on an error after leading off the third with a single.

Ursinus put the tying runs in scoring position in the top of the sixth when sophomore Ashley Brewer came in to relieve classmate Alyssa Bruckner. Brewer allowed one run to score on a single, but got the next two batters on a strikeout and groundout to keep the Mules ahead.

Freshman Maggie Scarpelli singled in Brewer with an insurance run in the bottom of the inning. With the tying runs in scoring position again in the top of the seventh, Brewer struck out the final batter to earn her second save. She also went over 100 strikeouts for the season, only the second Mule hurler to do so.

The complete schedule for the CC playoffs will be determined on Monday.

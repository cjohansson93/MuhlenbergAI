baseball to host local showcase


 
The Muhlenberg baseball team will host two other area squads at Coca-Cola Park next week in the first Alvin H. Butz, Inc. Lehigh Valley College Baseball Showcase.

The Mules are scheduled to renew their annual series with Division III rival DeSales on Monday, April 20, at 4:00, before taking on Division I Lehigh on Tuesday, April 21, at 4:00.

Coca-Cola Park is the second-year home of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the AAA affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. Last year, Coca-Cola Park was named “Ballpark of the Year” as presented by Ballpark Digest.

The games are being sponsored by Alvin H. Butz, Inc., the oldest and largest construction company of its kind in the Lehigh Valley, having operated continuously since its founding in 1920.

“Alvin H. Butz, Inc. is proud to support local college baseball,” said Greg Butz, President and CEO of Alvin H. Butz, Inc. “The Alvin H Butz, Inc. Lehigh Valley College Baseball Showcase will afford local student-athletes the opportunity to participate in a professional experience playing in beautiful Coca-Cola Park.” 

Both games will be televised live on Service Electric Cable TV2.

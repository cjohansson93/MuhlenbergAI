long, successful day for track teams 


The Muhlenberg track and field teams got a taste of what the Centennial Conference Championships, which are one day instead of two this year, will be like when they
competed in Susquehanna’s Orange & Maroon Classic, a meet with 24 teams that ran for 10 hours.

If their performance at Susquehanna is any indication, the Mules 




Brookland topped his previous indoor personal best in the triple jump by almost a foot-and-a-half.



will be more than ready when the CC meet comes around in five weeks.

Muhlenberg’s highlight of the 


Wrestlers Drop First CC Matches



The Muhlenberg wrestling team lost its first two Centennial Conference matches of the season, 31-17 to Gettysburg and 38-9 to host Johns Hopkins.

The Mules had a 17-15 lead after seven weight classes before the Bullets won the final three bouts.

Sophomore 141-pounder Kevin Homan was the lone double winner for Muhlenberg.

day was sophomore Marc Brookland breaking the oldest school record on the books when he triple jumped 45-3½. He beat the previous
mark of 44-5½, set in 1976, by 10 inches. Brookland left Allentown on the team bus at 7:30 in the morning and took off on the record jump on his last attempt about 12 hours later.
The mark put Brookland in first place, but a Moravian athlete beat him by 5 centimeters on his final jump.

Two of the Mules’ middle-distance runners 


pulled off impressive doubles, faring well in the mile and then coming back an hour later to do just as well is the 800.
Junior Bobby Torphy came in second in the mile at 4:20.92, the fifth-fastest time in program history, then won the 800 in a field of 54 runners with a time of
1:59.13. Senior Jennifer Lynch won the mile in 5:12.29 and came in fifth in the 800 with a personal-best time of 2:23.59.

Senior Jayne Condon, in her second meet for the Mules, ran the third-fastest 5,000 meters in team history, coming in fifth in 18:56.04.

Senior Alex Faust won the 400 meters and anchored the 4x400 relay team that came in second. She tied for the best height in the pole vault, but had to settle 
for second place because she had more misses.

He has commented on religion on hundreds of National Public Radio programs, and on television. Prothero was the chief academic adviser for the critically acclaimed six-hour WGBH-TV series, âGod in America.âThe event is co-sponsored by the chaplain’s office, Department of Religion Studies, Department of Languages, Literatures & Cultures, Institute for Jewish-Christian Understanding and the Muhlenberg Interfaith Community.Subsequent fall Center for Ethics events include: Woodrow Wilson Fellow Achy Obejas lecture and readingNov. 1, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller ForumCritically acclaimed author and Woodrow Wilson Fellow, Achy Obejas will introduce her newest book of short stories, the âTower of the Antilles,â with a book signing to follow.

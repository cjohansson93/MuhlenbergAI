 Learn More about Economics Experiments
What type of research am I signing up for?
By completing the sign up form you are registering to participate in economics experiments at Muhlenberg. The researchers conducting these experiments are interested in how you make decisions. The majority of these decisions will be made on a computer in a lab on campus.
Why should I sign up?
By registering you will have the opportunity to earn cash when you participate in an experiment.
Who sees the information I provide?
The information you provide will only be used by researchers to invite you to experiments. Every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. Please Â review the privacy policy for more information.
How will I be notified that I have been selected to participate?
Researchers will send email invitations about upcoming experiments. Invitations are randomly sent to individuals who are registered. Experiments will vary in length and day/time offered throughout the semester.
If invited, do I have to participate?
All participation is voluntary and the risks are minimal. All studies must be approved by Muhlenberg College’s Institutional Review Board.
If invited, how do I accept the invitation?
The invitation will contain a link to a calendar where you will be able to select which session (vary by date and time) you would like to sign up for. Sign up slots are on a first-come, first-served basis. You should only sign up for an experiment if you are able to show up on time and are able to commit to the entire length of the experiment. 
Do I have to be an economics major to participate?
No prior knowledge of economics is needed to participate.

Today’s Result:


MEN’S GOLF at McDaniel Spring Invitational. The second round of the tournament was canceled when a brief but powerful thunderstorm left some of the holes
unplayable. Since not everyone had finished the same nine holes, the tournament was reduced to 18 holes and only the first round counted. Muhlenberg finished tied for 11th.

Competing at the 197-pound weight class, Cerminara earned a first-period pin in his opening match and then won by decision over a Gettysburg foe to reach the finals.
Battling against a Merchant Marine opponent in the final, Cerminara scored a pin in the third overtime period, giving the Mules their first individual champion since 2009 and breaking the school record for pins in a season.
Sophomores Austin Sherman (133) and Dylan Schwartz (165) each placed third in their brackets, earning their first-ever CC medals.

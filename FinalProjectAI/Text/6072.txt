Perfect Day for a Run for Five Mules
 Saturday, October 8, 2011







					 



With Muhlenberg on Fall Break, the regionally ranked women’s cross country team got the weekend off, and so did the majority of the men’s team. A handful of men did stick around to run at 
the DeSales Invitational on the campus that will be the site of the NCAA Mideast Regional qualifier in November.

On a beautiful fall day, the Mules finished 28th out of 45 teams. Junior Michael Esposito (left) led the Muhlenberg contingent in 135th place out of 448 runners.

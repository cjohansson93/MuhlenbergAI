Put your training into practice



The Theatre & Dance Department sponsors a production program that reflects our core belief: theatre and dance must be an intellectual and a practical pursuit at the same time. Serious training and intense attention to student-artists create a collaborative environment in the Department, rather than a competitive one â empowering students to be creative and independent.
Typically, we mount at least six theatre productions, three dance concerts, and numerous other theatre and dance performances. All of these performances take place in the Department's state-of-the-art production facilities. And students are the heart and soul of every performance. During the covid health crisis, we are exploring alternate modes and media for theatrical performances.
The six Departmental theatre productions are as diverse in scale and style as possible, ranging from experimental blackbox productions in the Studio Theatre to big, Broadway-style musicals on a proscenium stage. In addition, the Muhlenberg Theatre Association (MTA) presents several student-directed, -designed, and -produced MTA Studio Productions and smaller-scale theatrical projects each year. Dance performance opportunities are equally rich and diverse.
Extensive production opportunities are available for students with every field of interest:

actors, in performances of every style, both musical and non-musical
directors, including at least one student-directed Departmental production each year
playwrights, whose plays are presented at every level from table readings to full-scale productions
designers of scenery, costumes, lights and sound
stage managers
dramaturgs

Students also have the chance to work as running crew, stitchers, carpenters, electricians, box office staff, marketers, and house managers for every production.
In addition to Theatre & Dance performances, a tremendous variety of performance ensembles give majors and non-majors alike the opportunity to sing, act, dance, and create. Student-directed ensembles, productions and concerts are a vital element of Muhlenberg's vibrant performing arts community.

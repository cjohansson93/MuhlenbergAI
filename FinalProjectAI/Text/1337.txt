John Williams
John Williams set Muhlenberg on an ambitious path of growth, change and service. With a new College Strategic Plan, new leadership in positions across the campus, rising quality in our entering classes and a deep commitment to supporting the faculty in their work as teachers and as scholars, he positioned the College for an exciting, entrepreneurial future, building on a solid foundation built by those who have gone before.
Taking office as our 12th president on July 1, 2015, President Williams brought to Muhlenberg his wide-ranging experience in liberal arts colleges and an extensive background in corporate leadership and entrepreneurship.
President Williams was born in New York City and grew up in suburban Long Island, N.Y. He earned his B.A., magna cum laude, in 1975 from Amherst College, where he majored in economics.
After graduating four years later from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, he became the first person of color ever hired at the strategy consulting firm Bain & Co. He went on to launch several successful entrepreneurial ventures. Among other positions, he was also a senior vice president at American Express and served as an expert-in-residence at Harvardâs Innovation Lab.
President Williams has traveled extensively and is also an accomplished pilot. He and his wife, Diane Pierce-Williams, have three adult children and one grandchild.

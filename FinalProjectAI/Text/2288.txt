Hopes hit .667 with eight RBI and four straight multi-hit games as baseball opened CC play with a 3-1 record. He went 5-for-6 with four RBI in the first Ursinus game. In the second Ursinus game, he drove in the tying run in the sixth, completing a comeback from an 8-3 deficit, and the go-ahead run in the seventh. The Mules won, 13-11, to sweep Ursinus in the regular season for the first time ever.  Hopes also went 3-for-5 with an RBI in Muhlenberg's 8-4 win at nationally ranked McDaniel.  The outburst raised Hopes' season average from .356 to .429 - second on the Mules and fifth in the CC. Hopes leads Muhlenberg in slugging percentage (.597) and on-base percentage (.500) and is second with 20 RBI.  Peterson went 2-0 without allowing an earned run in complete-game efforts against CC opponents Washington and Haverford. She tossed a five-hitter in the first game of the Washington doubleheader and scattered seven hits while striking out five against Haverford for her first career shutout. Peterson held the two teams to a .222 batting average.
The two wins evened Peterson's season record at 6-6. She has won her last three starts, lowering her ERA from 4.55 to 3.54, and is second in the CC with 10 complete games.

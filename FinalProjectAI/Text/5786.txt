Tennis Duo Falls in Final


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis doubles team of juniors Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld lost in the final at the Centennial Conference Invitational, but one of the
two is guaranteed to be in the singles final.

In a doubles semifinal, Powell and Rotfeld defeated the all-freshman Mule team of Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker, 9-8. The juniors played another tight 9-8
match in the final, falling to a Washington duo.

Powell and Rotfeld are scheduled to face each other in a singles semifinal on Sunday. Powell lost only three games in winning her first two matches, while Rotfeld needed
a third-set supertiebreaker to overcome a Johns Hopkins player in the quarters.

Druker nearly made it three Mules in the semis with an impressive showing against a three-time first-team All-CC player from Washington. Druker came back after dropping
the first set to win the second in a tiebreaker, then dropped the supertiebreaker, 10-8.

Sophomore Amy Cohen recorded six blocks in the Washington match.




A triple-double helped the Muhlenberg volleyball team score a most welcome double win.

Junior Megan Eiser recorded her first career triple-double with 37 assists, 11 digs and 11 kills to lead the Mules past Delaware Valley, 3-1, in the second of
two matches. Muhlenberg defeated host Washington in four games in the opener to break into the Centennial Conference win column.

The Mules (9-13, 1-4) had won only two of 13 matches since the last time they won two matches in one day, nearly a month ago on the first day of the Buttermaker Tournament.

After handily winning the first game against the Shorewomen, Muhlenberg rallied from a 25-23 deficit to take the second game, 30-26. Washington took the third, but the Mules
jumped out to a 7-0 lead in the fourth game, behind three kills from senior Jess Anselmi, and sealed the win, 30-12. Eiser, whose passing
enabled Muhlenberg to hit .464 in Game 4, served an ace for the final point.

Anselmi recorded a season-high 20 kills in the match.

The Mules dropped the first game to Delaware Valley and were tied 8-8 in the second game before running off nine straight points with junior Danielle Losonci serving
to take control of the match. Sophomore Christina Cangelosi served up seven aces, one short of the school record.

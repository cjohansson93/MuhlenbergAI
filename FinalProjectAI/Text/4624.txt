Travel Journal

barbados day four:communication and miscommunication


The fourth installment in a journal of the Muhlenberg field hockey team’s trip to Barbados by senior Jess Kasza:

If you were talking about someone from Barbados they would technically be called a Bajan (Bay-sian). Bajans can understand every word we say 
because they watch all of the movies and TV shows that we do in the States. They also listen to our music; and by music, I mostly mean 50 Cent. 

Therefore when holding a conversation with most Bajans it is really easy for them to understand you, but when they speak to you it is just 
embarrassing. Personally, I do the whole lean in and ask for a 



repeat because for some reason I think the louder they are the better I will 
understand them. False. 

Their accent is a mixture of British, Jamaican and a little bit of something else that I can't understand. Besides our tour guides and van 
drivers (who have to be understandable as a job requirement), I'm pretty sure everyone is just trying to make us feel crazy. 
However, despite this setback, the people here are extremely nice and really laid back.

Today was a rough wakeup for us at 6 a.m. Most of us were really sore and several people took ... gasp ... the elevator. We got in the vans 



and 
had practice from 7-9 when it was just starting to heat up outside. After 
practice we did a quick change and went down to breakfast 
(about a 3.25 out of 5 today). The beach and pool were pretty popular after breakfast as everyone relaxed for our game later on. 

Lunch was up to us this afternoon so Cait Teegarden and I ventured out to Chefette again to give them another try (I still say it was about 
a 2.75 but she begs to differ). We went from there to a little outdoor marketplace where I bought a few nice Barbadian things that were probably 
way overpriced because I didn't realize I could barter with the stand owners ... oops. 

We all got ready for the game and headed out to the field around 5:30. During our warmup Coach was summoned over to receive the news that the 
other team mixed up their days and thought our game was tomorrow. Long story short, the game was postponed until tomorrow. So we practiced for a 
little in front of some of the Bajans who decided to come cheer us on and then we left around 8. 

Dinner tonight was at Just Grillin' and it was 
really good; a 4.15 in my professional opinion. Dinner was eaten pretty fast because everyone heard that there was an ice cream place nearby. 
From what I was told, Chilly Moo's ice cream was delicious and worth every Barbadian penny. 

For now we are all resting up because tomorrow we are doing an "Island Man Tour" and scuba-diving/jet skiing as well as playing a game later in 
the day. Should be fun! :)

The strange weather at Friday’s Susquehanna Fall Invitational 



Snow, who entered the season with a career stroke average of 81.7, is averaging 77.8 through four rounds this fall.




didn’t include snow, but the top of the leaderboard did.

Junior Bill Snow of the Muhlenberg 
men’s golf team won medalist honors for the first time in his career by shooting a one-over-par 73, leading the Mules
to a second-place finish. Snow tied two other golfers for the lowest round and won on a match of cards.

“I was kind of shocked,” said Snow. “I knew Garrett [Carpenter] was three under for a while, and I knew 
Zach [Oyer] was one under for a while, so I felt I was going to be third on my team, let alone win the tournament.”

Consistency was the name of the game for Snow, the first Muhlenberg player to win a tournament since 2004. He was never more than one over or one under in matching his 
career-low round.

“I hit 14 greens, but I was not putting it close enough to get birdies,” he said.

In conditions that ranged from hot and sunny to cloudy and raining, Oyer finished with a 76 to tie for sixth in his first career competition, and Carpenter ended up with a 78. The second-place finish was the best for the Mules, other
than their own tournament, in four years.

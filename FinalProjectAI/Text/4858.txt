Milestones abound for womens lax 


After one of senior Amanda McGoverns four goals for the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team, she collided hard with a New England defender and fell to the turf.


If it affected her performance, you sure couldnt tell.

McGovern became just the third Mule in program history to score double-digit points in a game, tallying four goals and six assists in a 20-10 Muhlenberg win.




Rosen beats the New England goalie for the second goal of the game and the first of her career-high six.




In every game there is physical contact, said McGovern. Thats just part of the fun.

There was plenty of fun for the Mules (4-0) in the lopsided win, including the achievement of several milestones other than McGoverns career day. Junior Danielle Rosen entered the game needing seven points for 100 for her career, and she got exactly that, netting six goals and adding one assist. Rosen is the 17th Mule in school history to hit the century mark.

She is a great teammate, commented McGovern. She is the perfect attacker  she sees the field well and her feeds are right on. Shes the type of player everybody wants to play with.




Franck leads the Mules in ground balls (17) and caused turnovers (10).





Muhlenberg also hit two other nice, round numbers, scoring 20 goals in back-to-back games for the first time in program history and stretching its winning streak against non-conference opponents to 30 games.

Its a great team achievement, said McGovern of the streak. It shows how strong this program is and how strong our conference is. Its really, really nice.

The Mules defeat of the Pilgrims (1-1) was pretty nice, too. Senior Alyssa Bascelli started the scoring with a free-position goal 7:22 in, and 22 seconds later McGovern fed Rosen to make it 2-0.

After another Rosen goal made it 3-0, New England 



Rough Day for Mules in Jersey



The Muhlenberg baseball team played its home opener at Diamond Nation in Flemington, N.J., which is closer to the campus of the Mules opponent, The College of New Jersey. The Lions, who were in the NCAA Tournament last year, scored in each of the first five innings and won, 16-6. Sophomore Brian Beck went 3-for-5 with a two-run single for the Mules.

got on the board. But McGovern squashed any threat of a rally almost immediately, winning the ensuing draw control and racing the length of the field for a goal that ultimately came just 11 seconds after the Pilgrims.

Muhlenberg closed the first half on a 4-0 run to take a 10-4 lead into the break and ensured there would be no New England comeback right out of the gate of the second. McGovern won another draw  she had a team-high five in all  and fed freshman Alex Bellini for a goal 11 seconds in.

Just 17 seconds later McGovern found the back of the net, and the game would get no closer than eight the rest of the way.

We were really ready today, commented McGovern. Were hyped up knowing that conference games are starting up, and we came out as a team and finished as a team.

Bascelli recorded her second straight hat trick, and sophomore Mary Ann Collins added to the list of milestones by scoring her first career goal. Classmate Angela Napoletano scooped up a game-best seven ground balls, and senior Danielle Scarrone and freshman Alexandra Franck caused three turnovers each.

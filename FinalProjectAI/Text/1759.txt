Information Commons
The Information Commons (IC) is located beside the Periodicals Reading Lounge along the west wall on A-level. The IC is used for library instruction sessions and is open for study when not reserved for classes. 
B-01
B-01 is the computer lab classroom on B-Level. This lab has 32 desktop computers with various software licenses. During the regular semester, B-01 is open during normal library hours and closes a half hour before the building closes. The lab is open to the Muhlenberg community when it is not reserved for an library instruction session.
B-02
Professors schedule movie screenings in Trexler Library outside of standard class time; these can be movies owned by the library or a personal copy. These screenings are typically held in B-02, the video classroom, which is located along the west wall of the B-Level concourse. Please consult our B-Level Floor Plan for directions or ask the Lending Services desk staff members for assistance.
Curriculum Lab (TRXLR CRL)
The Curriculum Lab can be found on C-Level near the elevator. This space is reserved by the Muhlenberg Registrar for classes during the day and is available to our Education students in the evening. If a student has a class in this room, it might appear on their schedule as âTRXLR CRLâ.

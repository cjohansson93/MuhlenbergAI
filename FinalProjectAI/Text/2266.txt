This seasonâs Mnemonic Theatre Festival at Muhlenberg concludes with an entirely different sort of performance â a show with an audience of one.
âMemento: Mori: Triptychâ introduces an immersive theatrical space, entered in solitude, in which the visitor is the actor as well as the audience. Serving as a reflection on memory and mortality, the piece has been curated by a creative team of 14 theatre-makers, who have been tight-lipped about the elements of the experience, in order to preserve the magic for the actual performance.
âWe want everything to be a surprise, so that the reactions to the piece can be honest and authentic,â says Rebecca Lustig, a Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance faculty member, who describes her role in the process as the âconnective tissueâ of the company. âEveryone will have the chance to interact with the space without having any preconceived notions.â
Amongst the mysteries, hereâs what we do know: audience members should arrive with a smartphone and headphones. They will scan a QR code for a link to an audio file, which they can listen to as they move through the space. The experience takes about 20 minutes.
âThey may be asked to interact with the space,â Lustig says. âThe solitary audience member will move through three fragments, listening on their phone to a soundscape that we created to accompany their journey,â 
âMemento: Mori: Triptychâ is available May 14-16, to all members of the Muhlenberg community who are cleared for on-campus activities. The performance is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Reservations are required on Friday and Saturday, 5-8 p.m. 
Jessie Kuehne, a senior theater major at Muhlenberg College, and a member of the company, advises participants to take their time as they move through the space. 
âI think this is a moment where we can practice patience as we reflect and absorb our surroundings,â Kuehne says. âWe have the opportunities to challenge our bodies and minds to take 20 minutes to just breathe.â
âMemento: Mori: Triptychâ runs Friday through Sunday, May 14-16. Hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily; reservations are required Friday and Saturday after 5 p.m. Admission is free. Patrons can reserve a timeslot and get more information at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow.

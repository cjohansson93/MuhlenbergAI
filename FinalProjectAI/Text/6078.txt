The Muhlenberg cross country teams opened the 2011 season at the Lehigh Invitational.
The women finished sixth, and the men tied for sixth.

With 157 points, the women easily outplaced the two other Division III schools in the meet, local rivals DeSales (195) and Moravian (204). 
The men, who were only nine points out of fourth place, tied Moravian.

Junior Samantha Mayden was the top Division III finisher in the women’s race, coming in seventh out of 89 runners. She ran the 6K course in 22:58.90; last year at the same meet she clocked in at 24:48.70.

Senior William Lowrey led the Mule men’s team by coming in 13th in 19:13.40, nearly a minute faster than his time from last year. He was the third Division III runner across the finish line.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team opened the season by splitting a pair of matches at Marietta’s River City Classic. The Mules swept Oberlin in three sets
before getting swept by Kenyon.

Sophomore Morgan Duggan (left) had strong all-around numbers in both matches. She totaled 10 assists, 4 kills, 2 blocks and 4 aces against Oberlin and
added 9 assists, 5 digs and 2 aces against Kenyon. Senior Brooke McQueen led the Mules with 13 kills in the two matches.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team could not make a 1-0 halftime lead stand up and lost its season opener at Scranton, 3-1.

Junior Kiara Santana tapped in a blast from the right side by freshman Christine Germaske with 4:33 left in the first 
half for her first career goal. To that point, the shot totals were fairly even (five for the Royals, four for the Mules), but Scranton took the game over 
in the second half. The Royals took 14 shots in the last 35 minutes and put in three of them.

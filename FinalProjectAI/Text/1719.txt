Archives
Trexler Library holds archival material relating to the history of the College, members of its extended community, and collections pertaining to the local community.
We are in the process of migrating our archival finding aids into ArchivesSpace, a searchable database. A preview of select finding aids is available below. For access to materials or for information about collections not yet in ArchivesSpace, please contact susanfalciani@muhlenberg.edu.

Includes information about College history, campus buildings, administrators, faculty and staff, student organizations, event programs, and more. The finding aid for this collection is in the process of being migrated into ArchivesSpace, so please contact us about material that does not appear in the collection yet.

Search the Lehigh Valley LGBT Community Archive
The Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center and Trexler Libraryâs Special Collections and Archives have partnered to collect, preserve, and provide access to the Lehigh Valley LGBT Community Archive. This collection documents local and regional LGBT life and activism. It includes publications, organizational records, personal papers, oral histories, and artifacts. Additionally, you may search the records of Le-Hi-Ho (the Lehigh Valley Homophile Organization), housed at the Allentown Public Library.
Search the Allentown Band archives
In 2018, Special Collections partnered with Muhlenberg faculty members and students to process the archives of the historic Allentown Band. You can visit the resulting project site. The Bandâs materials are  housed at its headquarters in Allentown.

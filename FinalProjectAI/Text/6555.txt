Big Third Quarter Pushes Football Past Juniata

The second of back-to-back Centennial Conference home games for the Muhlenberg football team ended the same way as the first: with 35 points on the scoreboard and an entry in the win column.




Van Laar came into the game with a career total of 79 yards rushing.



The Mules scored 21 points in the third quarter and went on to defeat Juniata, 35-14, a week after a 35-31 win against Gettysburg. It was the first time ever that Muhlenberg played CC home games in consecutive weeks, and the first time since 2008 that the Mules scored at least 35 points in consecutive games.



Senior quarterback Dan Deighan rushed for 105 yards on only 11 carries and also threw for 176 yards and two touchdowns. Senior Terrence Dandridge scored a pair of touchdowns on the ground, and junior Kevin Van Laar rushed for a career-high 71 yards and a score.

Dandridge’s first touchdown, on a dive over the pile from the 1-yard line, capped a 59-yard drive and gave Muhlenberg a 7-0 lead with 5:32 left in the first quarter. Muhlenberg doubled its lead late in the half when Deighan hit senior Isaiah Vaughn in the back of the end zone from 31 yards out on third-and-17.

Juniata took advantage of a poor punt that gave it possession inside the 50 to score its first touchdown with 24 seconds left in the half. It was the first offensive score for the Eagles (1-6, 0-6) against the Mules since they joined the Centennial Conference in 2007.

Muhlenberg punted in its first third-quarter possession but scored on the next three. Deighan’s apparent 47-yard touchdown run was negated by an illegal block penalty at the 5, but the Mules scored anyway on Van Laar’s 1-yard run four plays later to make it 21-7.

The next two touchdowns came after interceptions in Mule territory. Senior Tim Vogel picked off a pass to halt a Juniata drive and raced 52 yards down the sideline, setting up a 5-yard scoring run by Dandridge three plays later. Deighan’s 5-yard touchdown pass to senior John Merklinger followed a pick by senior Matt Johnson.

Senior John Muha also recorded an interception to thwart an Eagle scoring attempt.

Johnson and junior Kory Crichton each recorded eight tackles for a defense that held Juniata to 46 rushing yards. Junior Johnathan Charles and sophomore Jeremey Thomas had two tackles for loss apiece, with Thomas adding a fumble recovery.

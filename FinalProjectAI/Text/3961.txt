Brewer named first-teamAcademic All-District




Senior Ashley Brewer of the Muhlenberg softball team added to her already lengthy list of honors by being named to the Capital One Academic All-District II College Division first team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).



 Brewer honored by LVAIAW



Earlier this week, senior Ashley Brewer (pictured above with coach Marisa DeStasio) of the Muhlenberg softball team was honored at the annual Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW) luncheon, where she was named Muhlenberg's Outstanding Athlete. Founded in 1978, the LVAIAW promotes women's sports in the spirit of collegiality among the schools in the area.





By being selected to the first team, she will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America consideration.

A chemistry major and mathematics minor, Brewer, who was named to the academic all-district second team last season, earned her second Centennial Conference player of the year award after helping the Mules win the conference title. She is Muhlenberg's 10th Academic All-District selection and the third player to be selected more than once. 

She currently ranks sixth in the conference in batting and fourth in ERA. Brewer leads the CC in RBI and is tied for the most home runs and wins. Her seven home runs this year have not only broken the school's single-season record, but the career mark as well. Her 13 career round-trippers are more than double the old record of six.
 
Brewer's 47 RBI have bettered the previous mark by 11, and her 35 runs scored would be the school record if it hadn't already been broken by two of her teammates this season. She also ranks second in extra-base hits (19) and third in hits (53) in a season. 

For her career, Brewer ranks third on Muhlenberg's hits, runs and stolen base lists and is second in extra-base hits and RBI, in addition to being the career home run leader. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team.

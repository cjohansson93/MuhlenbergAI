Track and field honors


two mules honored at hoops luncheon


Senior Erin McSherry and freshman Spencer Liddic were named to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Scholar-Athlete Teams at a luncheon yesterday 

at Starter’s Pub in Bethlehem.

McSherry is in her fourth season with the Mules 
and her first as team captain. A 6-1 center, McSherry is an intimidating presence on the court. 
In a game against Swarthmore in early December, McSherry set the school record for career blocks (128). Her 17 blocked shots so 


far this season rank third in the 
Centennial Conference.

McSherry also deserves recognition for her hard work in the classroom. A marketing major, McSherry completed an 
internship with contemporary designer 
Susana Monaco from mid-December 2007 to the end of February 2008, juggling work, school and basketball for a month and a half.

As far as her life beyond basketball, McSherry plans to pursue a career in fashion industry in New York City or Los Angeles.

Women’s head basketball coach Ron Rohn appreciates the leadership McSherry exhibits on the court — and off. “To find opportunities in the fashion industry while at 
Muhlenberg takes great initiative. There are few players I’ve been as proud of.” 

Like McSherry, Liddic is also ranked third in the Centennial Conference with his 20 blocked shots. His 7.2 rebounds per game and .506 field goal percentage are second on the 
Mules. The forward had 19 points and pulled down eight boards versus a nationally ranked Franklin & Marshall team.

“When he came in for preseason, he showed what a diligent person he was,” said men’s head basketball coach Dave Madeira, “and he’s obviously carried that over to the 
classroom. He’s very dedicated on and off the court.”

Liddic cites his father as the biggest influence on his athletic career. “My father was always a positive reinforcement; he never said anything negative.”

And his father has influenced him off the court as well. Liddic’s family has its own business and the business administration major one day hopes to run his own company.

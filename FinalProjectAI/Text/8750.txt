About OISS
The Office of International Student Support (OISS) provides guidance for incoming and continuing international students at Muhlenberg College in regards to their transition to American life and their academic pursuits in the liberal arts tradition.
Students work with staff to navigate the pathways for a successful student experience. They are also supported in maintaining and sharing their diverse human experiences from a variety of cultural and language backgrounds.
OISS provides immigration guidance to F-1 international students while supporting students at large during their time at Muhlenberg College. OISS also seeks to support on-campus internationalization efforts of the college and collaborates with many offices, clubs, departments and campus stakeholders.

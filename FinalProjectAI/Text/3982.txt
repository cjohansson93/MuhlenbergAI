baseball playoff chances dashed




Times Set for Womens Tennis Playoffs



For the first time since 1992, the Muhlenberg College womens tennis team will host a playoff match.
 
The Mules (9-5, 7-3) are the fourth seed for the Centennial Conference playoffs and will host fifth-seeded Haverford (13-6, 6-4) in a first-round match of regionally ranked teams on Wednesday, April 27, at 4:00. The winner will go on to face nationally ranked regular-season champion Johns Hopkins in a semifinal match on Saturday. The entire playoff schedule is as follows:
 
Wednesday, April 27
Haverford at Muhlenberg, 4:00
 
Saturday, April 30
Swarthmore at Washington, 12:00
Haverford-Muhlenberg winner at Johns Hopkins, 3:00

Sunday, May 1
championship match at Johns Hopkins, 3:00

The Mules last hosted a postseason match in 1992, when they lost to Scranton for the Middle Atlantic Conference North championship. The CC did not 
have team playoffs from its founding in 1994 through 2005.

The Muhlenberg baseball team dropped a doubleheader at Johns Hopkins and was eliminated from the Centennial Conference playoff race.

With the 9-2 and 11-4 wins, the Blue Jays (21-11, 14-3) clinched the top seed for the CC playoffs for the third time in four years. The Mules (10-25-1, 7-10) entered the day needing to win two of their final three games to have any shot at the playoffs. Swarthmore (9-9 CC) and Ursinus (9-9) remain in contention for the fourth and final playoff spot with one day remaining in the regular season.

Muhlenberg had only two hits in the first game, one of them the first career home run for freshman John Scuderi - the fifth Mule player to go yard this season. 

The Mules did better offensively in the nightcap, with 10 hits, but trailed 10-1 after seven innings. Sophomore Joseph Vila hit his team-leading fourth home run leading off the ninth, and senior Bobby Spindler and sophomore John Muha each went 2-for-4 with an RBI. Muha (above) had a double among his two hits and raised his team-leading batting average to .357.

Women's Soccer Picks Up Important CC Road Win

It was hardly a longshot for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team to defeat Franklin & Marshall. But it was a long shot that gave the Mules an important Centennial Conference win.


Senior CJ Graetzer knocked in a rebound of a long strike from classmate Susan Galgano early in the second half for the only scoring in Muhlenberg’s 1-0 win.

The victory left the Mules (6-6-1, 4-2) as one of five teams with an over-.500 record in the CC. Muhlenberg has road wins against the two teams at .500 (Dickinson and F&M) and plays under-.500 squads in three of its four remaining league games.

After a scoreless first half in which each team took six shots and the Diplomats (4-4-3, 2-2-1) hit the post once, the Mules had possession near the center line five minutes into the second half. Galgano sent the ball toward the net, and the F&M goalie kept it from going by getting a hand on it, but it bounced over her head. Graetzer (right) was there to knock the ball in for her third goal of the season and the 15th of her career.
 
The Muhlenberg defense made sure the goal would stand up, allowing only two shots – neither on goal – the rest of the game. Senior Amanda Wong (left) made all four of her saves in the first half to earn her fourth shutout of the season.

All four of the Mules’ CC wins this season have come by a 1-0 final.

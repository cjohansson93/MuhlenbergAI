Video creation and video lecture caption are two areas growing within higher education. There are two main areas discussed on this webpage where video content comes into the general Muhlenberg community:

Videos@Muhlenberg: our own public-facing video streaming platform akin to YouTube
My Media in Canvas: the private, course-specific media content in our learning management system

We have designed this webpage into sections based on existing user familiarity with video and lecture capture as well as the situation bringing you to our resources.

General Support Information
In preparation for the migration from Kaltura to Panopto, some documentation is being updated or archived. We have items related to Panopto already available on the ITMS site for any new videos. We are keeping some of this documentation available for those with existing content, but do note that as the migration progresses, access to certain areas and their respective documentation may change. Please contact us at itms@muhlenberg.edu should you have any needs or questions. 
For academic videos which are not your own productions and for related copyright questions, please contact Trexler Library staff to inquire about Trexler Reserves.
Please note that our new website will ultimately include areas for the Learning Management System, Collaboration Tools, WebConferencing, and Media Services, so that each set of tools and resources will have its own webpage accessible through the main ITMS website.
 
I'm new to this
For new videos, please refer to our Panopto documentation on this ITMS page.
 
It's a new semester
For academic videos which you are not your own productions and for related copyright questions, please contact Trexler Library staff to inquire about Trexler Reserves.
The Learning Management System (Canvas) and Videos@Muhlenberg connect with the same repository of videos.
Remember that in Canvas, Media Gallery houses faculty video collections for students; My Media is where your individual videos are located, acting as your personal video library. Faculty can move videos from My Media to Media Gallery using these following six steps:

Go to your particular Canvas course page.
Select Media Gallery.
Once in Media Gallery, select the add media (blue button).
Open list of videos owned/published.
Click the box to the left of the video/file.
Select publish button in upper right.

These steps will bring the video(s) selected into the course so that your students may access them in the Media Gallery section of their class Canvas page.
We have additional documentation about bringing videos into My Media, Media Gallery, and into other areas of Canvas (Learning Management System) shells.
I'm stuck/needing help
Have suggestions for additional items for our new video website? Please contact the team at itms@muhlenberg.edu with items you will like included or if something you are seeking is not currently present/available.

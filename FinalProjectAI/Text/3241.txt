Hopkins win continues to pay “royal”-ties



Three days after beating Johns Hopkins, the sixth-ranked team in Division III, and with a non-conference game interrupting its push for the playoffs, the Muhlenberg field hockey team showed no letdown, defeating Scranton 3-1.

The Mules (7-8) played another sharp game in extending their winning streak to a season-best three games. They had advantages of 13-4 in shots and 14-3 in penalty corners to easily win what shaped up to be a tight game, based on scores against common opponents.

Junior Kristen Sabia scored her fourth goal of the season 10 minutes into the game, converting a pass from classmate Nicki Notarianni - one of two Muhlenberg starters who braved the suddenly cold weather without an undershirt.

The Mules tripled their lead in the first 10 minutes of the second half, scoring on blistering shots by sophomore Jess Kasza (right) and junior Tara Cohn, who has scored a goal in five straight games and eight of the last nine.

Only a late goal by the Royals (8-8) spoiled the shutout bid.

Their non-conference schedule complete, the Mules now turn their attention back to the Centennial Conference race. With three games to play, Muhlenberg is in a tight pack of six teams – only three of which are likely to make the playoffs – separated by just one win.

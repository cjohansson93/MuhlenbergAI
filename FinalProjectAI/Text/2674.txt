Men’s Lax, Baseball Playoff Schedules Set



Schedules for this weekend’s Centennial Conference tournaments involving Muhlenberg teams have been established. Both Mule squads open up on the road against nationally ranked opponents.

Men’s lacrosse will play its first-ever postseason game at Gettysburg on Friday, May 2, at 1:30. The Mules (10-4) have won eight in a row, while the 
Bullets (13-2) dropped their regular-season finale to Franklin & Marshall and fell from No. 2 to No. 3 in the national poll.

Gettysburg, the four-time defending CC champion, won the regular-season meeting, 16-5.

The other semifinal matches second-seeded Washington against third-seeded Haverford Friday at 4:30. The winners meet Sunday at 1:00 at Gettysburg for the CC championship.

Baseball, in the postseason for the first time since 2003, starts double-elimination play at Johns Hopkins on Friday, May 2, at 3:00. The Blue Jays (30-5), ranked sixth in the D3baseball.com poll, have won  26 of their last 28 games, but one of the losses was to Muhlenberg (20-17) in the second game of  a doubleheader.

Franklin & Marshall hosts Haverford in the other first-round game Friday at 3:00. The rest of the tournament will be held at Johns Hopkins, beginning at 9:00 Saturday morning. The Mules will play their second tournament game Saturday at 12:30, or 30 minutes after the conclusion of the morning game.

Of the six CC spring sports for which teams had to qualify for playoff tournaments, Muhlenberg made the field in four, tying Haverford for the most in the league.




Muhlenberg athletes Kyle Farris and RiRi Ferrigno were named Centennial Conference player of the week in their respective sports.

Farris was honored in men’s lacrosse after setting a school record with his seventh hat trick of the season in the Mules’ 9-8 win at Ursinus. The third goal, with 3:26, proved to be the 

difference as Muhlenberg clinched its first playoff berth with the win.

Farris also scored two goals in limited time in a midweek non-CC victory against Moravian. The five goals gave him an even 100 for his career.

Farris is tied for sixth in the CC in goals per game (2.50) and is tied for the league lead with 12 man-up goals and five game-winning goals.


Ferrigno took softball honors after hitting .429 with two home runs and nine RBI as the Mules split their last four games of the season. She started Muhlenberg's eight-run inning against Ursinus with a single and capped it a grand slam. Ferrigno added a three-run homer in the first game of the Washington doubleheader.

There have been only seven grand slam home runs in Mule softball history, and Ferrigno has hit two of them.

Ferrigno finished the campaign with .311 batting average and team-leading 20 RBI. She hit .367 in CC games.

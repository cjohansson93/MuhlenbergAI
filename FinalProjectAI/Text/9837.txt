Admission & Auditions
An audition or interview is not required for admission to study in the Department. Any student admitted to Muhlenberg College may declare a major or take classes in the Theatre & Dance Department. However, an audition can be a great way for us to get to know you and for you to get to know the theatre program.
Students with strong skills are encouraged to audition/interview. A good audition could improve your chances of being admitted to the College, and an audition and interview are required for applicants who wish to be considered for talent-based scholarship awards.
In past years we have encouraged prospective students who live within 200 miles of the college to do an on-campus audition or portfolio review â a policy which of course shifted for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic. We are currently revisiting audition practices for 2021-22 â but in-person facility tours are back, and we encourage you to visit the campus, meet members of the department, and get a tour of the facility.

Applying to Muhlenberg
Admission to Muhlenberg College is highly competitive. For detailed information about college admission, including application deadlines, please visit the Muhlenberg Admissions website.
If you are sure that you want to attend Muhlenberg, we encourage you to apply early decision.
If you are planning to apply Early Decision 1 and you would like to have an interview and audition, you should do so by Nov. 15.
Meet a Theatre Representative
You can meet a representative of Muhlenberg's nationally ranked theatre program at College Fairs around the country.
Financial Aid
The Office of Financial Aid at Muhlenberg is designed to be a resource for families of all income levels. In addition to the College's student aid funds, the Department offers the following special financial aid programs.
The Baker Scholarships in the Arts and Muhlenberg Talent Grants award from $1,000 to $4,000 per year on the basis of an audition and/or interview with the staff of the department and references from theatre or dance teachers. These scholarships are renewable on the basis of continued participation in the programs of the Department of Theatre and Dance.
Students who qualify for a Work-Study grant may apply for a work-study position in the administrative office, scene shop, or costume shop. These grants are awarded in return for up to ten hours work per week as a carpenter, electrician, stitcher, box office associate, marketing associate, videographer, or dance studio assistant. Students interested in a work-study position should contact General Manager Jess Bien at the very beginning of the semester: bien@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3087.

Men's Basketball Aces Post-Finals Test

 Women’s basketball


After a week of final exams, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team aced a test on the court,
clicking on all cylinders in an 86-57 win against a DeSales team that received votes in this week’s D3hoops.com poll.

The Mules (5-4) played their most complete game of the season in winning local bragging rights by
sweeping Division III rivals Moravian and DeSales for the second year in a row.



Muhlenberg shot 52.5 percent from the field while holding the Bulldogs (7-3) to 34.5-percent shooting. Three
players recorded career highs in points, with sophomore John Hunter scoring 20 on 8-of-10
shooting, freshman Nick Rindock pouring in 18 and sophomore Brandon LaRose
adding 15.

Rindock tied a school record, achieved three times previously, by going 5-for-5 from three-point range. Sophomore
Jon Schreer also was hot from long distance, making four of seven three-point tries en route to
scoring 16 points.

Rindock, Schreer and LaRose were a combined 11-of-15 on three-pointers.

Senior Malique Killing did not reach double figures for the first time this season,
finishing with five points, but he had eight assists, with his penetration and kickouts accounting for several
open looks from the perimeter.

The 86 points were the most scored by Muhlenberg against DeSales in 21 years, and the 29-point margin of
victory was the biggest in the series in 29 years.

The Mules trailed 13-11 before LaRose hit a three to kick off a 10-0 run that put them ahead for good. Down
by 10 at the half, DeSales cut the gap to four at the 15-minute mark, but Muhlenberg held off the run
with its defense, not allowing a field goal for a span of 11-and-a-half minutes.

Another 10-0 run that featured a tipin by freshman Mitch Cohen gave the Mules their first
20-point lead, and a dunk by LaRose with just under five to play put an exclamation point on the win.

Hunter (left) scored 15 of his 20 points in the second half and pulled down eight rebounds.

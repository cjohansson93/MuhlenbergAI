Two Earn All-CC Women's Soccer Honors

A pair of seniors who helped lead the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team to the Centennial Conference semifinals received All-CC honors.

CJ Graetzer was named to the first team for the second year in a row, while fellow co-captain Stephanie Tramutola received honorable mention.

Graetzer (right), a midfielder, was the Mules’ leading scorer with six goals and 13 points. Two of those goals came in the final game of the regular season, a 4-0 victory over Bryn Mawr that clinched Muhlenberg’s CC playoff berth, and her successful penalty kick proved to be the winning strike in a shootout at McDaniel in the first round.

Graetzer, an All-Mid-Atlantic Region selection last year, made 68 starts in a career in which she started all but six games. Graetzer ranks 12th on the program’s all-time list with 18 career goals, and her 43 total points place her inside the top 15 in that category. Graetzer, who received honorable mention honors as a freshman and sophomore, is the ninth Mule to earn All-CC recognition in each of her four years and the sixth to make the first team in consecutive years. 

Tramutola (left), a four-year starter at back, helped anchor a Muhlenberg defense that posted nine shutouts and allowed 15 goals in CC play. The senior, who played in the midfield as a freshman, started every game but one in her Mule career. Tramutola also contributed to the offense with three assists, giving her a career total of seven to go along with four goals.  

Both Tramutola and Graetzer will also be named to the CC Academic Honor Roll.

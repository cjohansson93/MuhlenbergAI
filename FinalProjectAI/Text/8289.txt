Eboo Patel, a member of President Barack Obama's inaugural Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships and president of the Interfaith Youth Core, will give a talk, “Civil Discourse: Promoting Social Change through Interfaith Action" on Wednesday, March 11, 2015, at 7:30 p.m. in Muhlenberg College's Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. This event, co-sponsored by the Center for Ethics, the Chaplain’s office and the Institute for Jewish Christian Understanding, is free and open to the public.
Named by U.S. News & World Report as one of America’s Best Leaders of 2009, Patel is the author of Acts of Faith and Sacred Ground. He is also a regular contributor to the Washington Post, National Public Radio and CNN. He holds a doctorate in the sociology of religion from Oxford University, where he studied on a Rhodes scholarship.
Patel believes that religious and non-religious identities can serve as a bridge of cooperation rather than a barrier of division. In an increasingly pluralistic society, what knowledge base and skill do we need to create these bridges? Patel's answer is interfaith leadership: the ability to voice values, engage diversity, and act on behalf of the common good.
This event is part of the year-long Center for Ethics series, Civility and Disobedience, under the direction of Brian Mello, associate professor of political science, and Christine Sistare, professor of philosophy.
Each year, the Center for Ethics sponsors an intensive series designed to encourage discussion and reflection on a timely, pertinent topic.  Center for Ethics programs are free and open to all members of the Muhlenberg campus and the local community.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year college located in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.  Muhlenberg offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, along with selected pre-professional studies and a number of interdisciplinary majors.

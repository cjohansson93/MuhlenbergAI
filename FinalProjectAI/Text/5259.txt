boyle finalist forall-america team again


For the second year in a row, senior Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team has been named a finalist for the State Farm Coaches’ All-America Basketball Team, as selected by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).

Boyle is one of 42 finalists, who are voted upon by WBCA member coaches in each of eight geographical regions, now in the running for selection to the 10-member State Farm Coaches’ All-America Team. 

A three-time first-team All-Centennial Conference selection, Boyle is second on the Mules in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game. She also is third on the team in assists (84), steals (37) and blocked shots (16) and is shooting a team-best 83.1 percent from the foul line.

On the program’s career list, Boyle is second in scoring (1,494 points) and field goals (598) and fifth in free throws (257) and assists (281). She is six points away from becoming the 12th player in Centennial Conference history to score 1,500 points.

Boyle has led Muhlenberg to a 92-20 record the last four years, with three CC championships and the program’s first trip to the NCAA Division III Sweet 16 this year. She was the Mules’ leading scorer in four of her five NCAA Tournament games, including both this year.

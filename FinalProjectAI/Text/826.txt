âInstaskate"
skateboarder's exploration of the ways in which Instagram is changing that landscape for female skaters, the web-project InstaSkate examines the all female skateboarding crew The Skate Kitchen. Central questions driving this exploration are, what are the outcomes of The Skate Kitchen's negotiation of commercial and amateur content on their Instagram page? And, how is The Skate Kitchen negotiating issues of authenticity via their Instagram presence? The Skate Kitchen can provide as a model for underrepresented or misrepresented identities looking take agency over their public image as well as looking to mobilize their communities both on and offline.

Muhlenberg College is committed to providing a diverse and inclusive educational environment for all students, faculty, and staff. The Office of Equity and Title IX supports this commitment in its responsibilities by ensuring that all Muhlenberg community members can equally participate in Muhlenbergâs educational and employment opportunities regardless of age, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national or ethnic origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other identity as protected by applicable laws. The Office of Equity and Title IX, in collaboration with campus partners, provides guidance and training to faculty, staff, and students to support diversity, inclusiveness, equal access, equitable treatment, and the prevention of prohibited discrimination and harassment at Muhlenberg College.
The Office of Equity and Title IX oversees response and investigation of all reports and complaints of bias, identity-based discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, stalking, and retaliatory harassment as prohibited by College policies addressing such conduct.

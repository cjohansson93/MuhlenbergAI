About Me: Living in Tampa it's easy to enjoy the outdoors and especially riding bikes around town or hanging out on the front porch with neighbors. I'm a big fan of the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Philadelphia Phillies. I was a fan of the Phillies long before I started at Muhlenberg!
Advice for Prospective Students: Do you have any tips for me?... I jumped aboard the house plant bandwagon recently and could use some help. Be authentic and honest with yourself when you are exploring colleges, reflecting on *why* you want to go to college, and answering other questions like 'what do I have the most fun doing'. Write down answers, revisit answers, and revise answers to these questions as you grow. Doing so can help your journey through high school and to college be one of growth instead of a task to be done.
Favorite Food on Campus? My favorite lunch when I'm on campus is a PB&J sandwich from the General's Quarters. It's basic, yes, it's also an experience... I enjoy it on Parents Plaza while watching the campus go by.

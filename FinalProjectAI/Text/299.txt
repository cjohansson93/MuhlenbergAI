At Muhlenberg, there are three main ways we augment active learning and engagement with online content: the layering of interactive presentation slides, the sharing of computer screens while working, and the collaborative annotation of common reading documents.
Three main collaboration tools currently in use at Muhlenberg include VoiceThread, Mirroring360, and Hypothes.is respectively. You may use these collaboration tools as faculty, staff, or as students. 
We have designed this webpage into sections based on existing user familiarity with the collaboration tools as well as the situation bringing you to our resources. You may use the links below to navigate to the particular section of interest or review all the content on collaboration tools.

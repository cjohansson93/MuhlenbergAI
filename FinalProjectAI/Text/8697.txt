International Applicants: To be considered for need-based funding and merit scholarships, please visit the international student financial aid page for forms and requirements.
All transfer students are considered for need and merit-based aid.
Students will be notified of admission on a rolling basis (beginning March 1st for Fall transfer applicants and November 15th for Spring transfer applicants). All students who have completed the aid process will also receive their financial aid award when notified of admission to the college.
Typically, 35-40 transfers are admitted every fall and 10-15 transfers are admitted every spring.
Housing is required for transfer students. Students with local permanent mailing addresses can choose to commute.

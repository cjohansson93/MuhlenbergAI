What can you do with a degree in Philosophy?
Contrary to popular belief, independent statistics show that philosophy majors are among the most successful graduates after leaving college.
The understanding and skills gained through the study of philosophyâwriting clearly, speaking persuasively, thinking creatively, solving problems, and constructing strong and convincing argumentsâare highly prized by every profession, including law, medicine, government, and business.  
Several business leaders have noted that the skills cultivated in the humanities are highly prized in science, technology, and business. They have also noted that these skills are unlikely to be automated, and so will surviveâ¦while robots and computers replace humans in many technical fields.
Philosophy in the Marketplace

National studies show that Philosophy students achieve higher scores on MCATs and LSATs than students who major in most other fields, and professional school admissions officers and associations stress their interest in philosophically trained applicants.
Best Majors for GRE Scores
Further, in a rapidly shifting, global economy, the study of Philosophy is especially helpful for those of us who will change career paths several times â often in response to the development of entirely new careers.  Philosophy students are trained to think creatively and hypothetically, and so they are particularly able to âthink on their feetâ and solve novel problems.

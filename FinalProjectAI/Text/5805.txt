Good named player of the week




Kean Stuns Women’s Soccer




The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team appeared to be in complete control of its game at Kean twice, but the Cougars came back for a 3-3 tie.

The Mules (1-0-1) had a 15-3 advantage in shots in the first half and took a 2-0 lead into the break on a pair of goals by sophomore Christina O’Grady. Kean quickly
tied the score with a pair of goals 69 seconds apart in the early stages of the second half.

Sophomore Kasey Hacker (right) put Muhlenberg back in front with 17:05 to play when she took a pass at the 18, spun and left-footed a shot into the net. The Cougars tied the game
with just four seconds left in regulation, however, and neither team had a great scoring chance in overtime.

Senior linebacker Dustin Good of the Muhlenberg football team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Good made a career-high 11 tackles, including three tackles for loss and two sacks, and broke up a pass as Muhlenberg blanked 
The College of New Jersey, 15-0, in its opening game on Friday night.  

Good led a defense that held the Lions to minus-32 yards rushing and 91 total yards, while not allowing a third-down conversion in 13 tries to record the Mules’ first
season-opening shutout in 23 years.

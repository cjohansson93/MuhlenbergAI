Muhlenberg split a doubleheader with Clark (Mass.) on its second day in Florida, dropping the opener 7-6 before coming back to win the nightcap, 12-8.

In the first game, the Mules trailed 7-1 before senior Edward Risener belted a three-run homer in the sixth. Muhlenberg added two more runs in the
seventh but came up a run short. 

Muhlenberg put away the second game with a seven-run fourth inning. Senior John Kalis led the offense with two hits, including a triple, and a pair of RBI.

Rosen is more than halfway to her 2008 total of seven goals scored.


A little snow couldn’t stop the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team from winning – but when it comes to non-conference games, little can.

The Mules opened the 2009 season with an 18-9 win at Randolph-Macon in a game played in light snow. It was their 23rd consecutive win in a non-conference game.

With flurries falling, Muhlenberg started the game by scoring in flurries. Seniors Ruth Morrongiello and Megan Wilson and sophomore Danielle Rosen scored
the first three goals of the game in a span of a minute. After senior Sara Hiller netted a goal to make it 4-0, Wilson added another one just 10 seconds later.

The Mules eventually extended their lead to 7-0 and held at least a six-goal margin the rest of the game.

Rosen finished with a career-high four goals, and Morrongiello and junior Amanda McGovern also scored four times. Hiller added three goals, extending her 
school-record consecutive
game scoring streak to 34.

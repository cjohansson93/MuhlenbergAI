Rivalry Relay Highlights Home Indoor Track Meet
 Friday, January 24, 2014







					 





The Muhlenberg men’s cross country team “banded” together to win its honor back.

Last year at the Mules’ indoor home meet, a 4x400-meter relay team comprised entirely of athletes who played football in the fall beat a quartet of cross country runners. Determined not to let history repeat, the cross country runners dipped into junior Josh Elkan’s extensive collection of headbands and, in a show of solidarity, donned headbands of different colors for this year’s rematch.

It worked. The team of sophomore Forrest Kentwell (pink headband), junior Kieran Newcomb (green), Elkan (red) and senior Jarrett Felix (blue) crossed the finish line more than two seconds ahead of the football foursome, with Elkan taking the lead on the third leg and Felix bringing it home.

The cross country relay team not only won the internal rivalry, but it also finished first in the event, capping a solid second meet of the season for the Mules.



A strong Wesley team prevented the home team from winning as many events as it usually does at the Muhlenberg Invitational, but the Mules had four first-place finishes. In addition to the men’s 4x400, sophomore Katrina Faust (right) in the high jump, freshman Claudia Theriault (pole vault) and senior Stephanie Carnevale (55 hurdles) won their events. Six other athletes came in second.

Faust (tied for ninth) and Theriault (third) moved up Muhlenberg’s all-time performance lists with their winning heights. Also putting their names on the women’s performance lists were sophomores Francesca Aldrich (seventh in the 55) and Claire Thornton (10th in the 400) and freshman Jacqueline Jones (tied for ninth in the high jump).

Senior Scott Reutter (left) had an outstanding meet for the men, setting personal bests in the hurdles, pole vault (by eight inches) and shot put (by more than a foot). Reutter started the season with a best time of 8.82 in the hurdles and has lowered it by more than a tenth of a second in each of the first two meets, from 8.71 to 8.54 (tied for eighth on the performance list).

Freshman Jake Waleski finished fourth in the 55 with the seventh-best time in program history, and junior Jacob Miller-Sobel moved into a tie for seventh on the performance list with his third-place finish in the pole vault.

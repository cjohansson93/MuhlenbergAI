  Gregory Kisver '00 Majors: Russian Studies/Computer ScienceI am currently enrolled in Graduate school at Wagner College in Staten Island, NY, attending full time in pursuit of an MBA with a concentration in management. My future plans are not certain but I am entertaining the idea of attending Law School upon graduation. I have been told that my Russian degree makes me unique and marketable. When applying for grad schools I was informed at the interview that my Russian had intrigued the review boards interests. The department head later told me my resume would hold extra weight because of the discipline involved in learning Russian.My knowledge of the Russian Economy has been a tremendous asset in many of my business classes. On a social level people find my background very unusual. I am very pleased that I chose the path I did and had Dr. Luba Iskold as my mentor, professor, employer, and friend.-Greg KisverP.S.: My framed KANDINSKY hangs on the wall in my office.

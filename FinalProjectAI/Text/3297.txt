Volleyball closes out desales in three



Mens Soccer Blanked by Wilkes


The Muhlenberg mens soccer team suffered a rare 2-0 home loss to Wilkes.

The Mules (2-2), who entered the game ranked sixth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, hadnt lost or given up a goal to Wilkes in eight meetings dating back to 1983. They also had been shut out only once in their last 27 games.

Muhlenberg had a 19-7 advantage in shots, but the Colonels (2-2) scored the first goal in the fifth minute of the second half and added an insurance score with 13:47 to go.

Looking at comparative results from last weekends Buttermaker Tournament, there was every reason to expect a close match between the Muhlenberg and DeSales volleyball teams. And the match was close  until the end.

The Mules finished strong in all three sets and swept their local 



Cangelosi had 10 of her 23 digs in the first game alone.



rivals for the first time since 2000.

Both squads went 3-1 at the Buttermaker 

Tournament, both coming from behind to defeat York in five games and both knocking off Medaille. The Bulldogs (6-5) also beat Moravian, a team Muhlenberg had swept the previous weekend.

DeSales jumped out to an 18-10 advantage in the first set and led 24-20 before the Mules ran off the final six points behind the serving of freshman Davi Gordon. Senior Megan Eiser and freshman Jackie Price closed out the set by combining on a block.

In the second set, it was Muhlenbergs turn to take a big early lead, 15-8. The Bulldogs crept to within 21-19, but the Mules again took control at the end, winning 25-20. Gordon and Eiser teamed up for a block, and then each recorded a kill for the final three points.

DeSales was three points from forcing a fourth set, with a 22-17 lead, before Muhlenberg scored eight of the last nine points. Junior Phylicia Lee provided the final three points with three of her team-high 12 kills.

The Mules played excellent defense, averaging more than 26 digs per set. Junior Christina Cangelosi recorded 23 digs, and senior Danielle Losonci added a career-high 17.

Gordon and Price totaled eight kills apiece.

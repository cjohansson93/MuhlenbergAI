When you think of hermit crabs, you may picture the ones sold as pets in boardwalk shops at the shore. Theyâre displayed in tanks that appear to hold only an expanse of shells until maybe, after a few minutes of watching, you notice knobbly crustacean legs emerging from one of them. They may be the worldâs most boring petsâbut in the wild, their lives are anything but.
Just ask Brooke Torjman â19, who spent the summer researching hermit crabs on Washington stateâs San Juan Island with her mentor, biology professor Erika Iyengar. âIf you look at any regular crab, they have a hardened carapace,â Brooke says. âHermit crabs donât have thatâthe abdomen is squishy and soft. Without a shell, theyâre going to get eaten or theyâll dry out and die.â
And, because they donât produce their own shells, they rely on abandoned ones to survive. âHermit crabs molt to grow, so they routinely need bigger shells,â she adds. âTheyâre constantly fighting over them.â
Brooke researched how hermit crabs choose their shells. In the wild, she found that shells from the most prevalent snail species in a given area were most popular among the hermit crabs in that area. When given the choice between four types of shells in a lab environment, however, the crabs didnât necessarily choose the ones they would in the wildâwhich indicates that, in times of fierce competition, they simply choose whichever available, appropriately sized shell they can wrest from a weaker crab.
âI kind of just geeked out over how cool I thought everything was,â Brooke says.
Iyengar got to witness Brooke maturing as a researcher, in the field and in the lab. âThe difference in her approach to science from the beginning of the summer to the end of the summer is amazing,â Iyengar says. âAt one point, she said, âItâs just so much more complex than I thoughtâthere are so many variables to consider, so many things to control for.â That is a good and healthy attitude.â The immersive experience of doing research full-time accelerates the growth students might only begin to experience doing a few hours of lab work per week during a semester, she says.
It helped that Brooke was working with Iyengar, whoâs been conducting research on San Juan Island for 20 years. âI was her only research student,â Brooke says. âIt was great having that one-on-one time and having her teach me the skills of being a researcher. She really trained me to think the way a scientist does out in the field.â
Brooke says the experience made her reevaluate her path. âFor the first year and a half of college I was premed. For my whole life, it was being pushed upon me. Now, Iâd like to move on to grad school and pursue a Ph.D. in marine ecology,â she says. âI really like the outdoors and nature and being surrounded by living things. I found my niche.â

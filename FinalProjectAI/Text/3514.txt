MULE WOMEN UPSET NO. 9 SCRANTON


Playing for the first time in 29 days, the 25th-ranked Muhlenberg
women’s basketball team picked up right where it left off and defeated
ninth-ranked Scranton, 79-66, to improve to 9-0 on the season.

The Mules set a school record with their ninth consecutive win and
extended their school-record home winning streak to 14. Scranton (8-2)
entered the game with a seven-game streak.

Muhlenberg made 11 of its first 13 shots to open up a 25-11 lead seven
minutes into the game. The Mules shot 55 percent from the field in the
first half, scoring 49 points against a team that came in allowing an
average of 53.6 points per game.

Down 13 at halftime, Scranton cut the deficit to five, at 54-49, with
12:58 to play, but was held to one field goal over the next five-plus
minutes as Muhlenberg re-extended its lead to double digits.

All five starters scored in double figures for the Mules, led by senior
Lindsay St. Lawrence, who scored 14 of her season-high 19 points in the
first half. Junior Randi Baran scored a career-high 15 points and tied a
career best with seven assists. 

Senior Jenn Risley also scored 15 points, while sophomore Susan Marchiano
had 11 points to go along with career highs of 16 rebounds and four
blocks. Sophomore Becky Richmond recorded 11 points, seven rebounds and a
career-high six assists.

The Mules had never defeated the Lady Royals in seven previous meetings,
losing by an average of 24.1 points.

Palladino Named Player of the Week
 Sunday, November 9, 2014 - page 4







					 




For the second time in three weeks, sophomore Nick Palladino of the Muhlenberg football team
was named Centennial Conference player of the week.

Palladino threw for a career-high 375 yards in the Mules’ 41-27 win against Ursinus, completing 32 of 44
passes with four touchdowns and no interceptions. He broke the school record for completions in a season and 
came within one of tying the record for completions in a game.

The 375 yards topped Palladino’s previous career best of 373, set two weeks ago against Juniata, and made him
the first quarterback in Muhlenberg history to record three straight 300-yard games. In those three games, 
Palladino has completed 84 of 112 passes (75 percent) for 1,064 yards with 10 touchdowns.

For the season, Palladino has thrown for 2,367 yards – tied for second on the Mules’ all-time list,
193 away from the school record. His 21 touchdown passes are five short of the school record. He leads the
CC in touchdown passes, completions (204), completion percentage (.664) and fewest interceptions (2).

The win improved Palladino’s career record as a starter to 15-3.

Prospective students often wonder what they can do with a degree in environmental science? The short answer is: there are many opportunities! A major in environmental science prepares students for careers in industry, government, research, and academia. Some students obtain employment right after completing their Muhlenberg education and some enter graduate school.
Job opportunitiesEmployment opportunities for environmental science majors are found in environmental consulting firms, environmental departments in local, state or federal agencies, environmental compliance and problem solving in industry, laboratories doing environmental testing, nature education centers, natural resource management, and non-profit environmental advocacy groups. Here is small sampling of the diverse positions our alumni have taken in the past decade.

Mission Statement

The Office of Global Education strives to provide academic opportunities for students and faculty members to develop global awareness and exposure to diverse traditions and perspectives through participation in off-campus programs, both internationally and domestically. Our list of approved programs enables students to engage in the academic and social life of host institutions in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. In addition, programs that provide opportunities for experiential learning through internships and field work research projects are available to integrate intellectual explorations with student involvement in local communities. We also provide support services for faculty members to develop short-term faculty-led study abroad programs, to participate in international faculty development seminars, to visit and evaluate foreign host institution sites, and to foster teaching and research opportunities abroad.

Timeline

Internships are often unpaid in this area and are often posted on an as-need basis
Itâs likely that youâll find these internships posted in the Spring Semester
If youâre interested in political campaigns, they always need volunteers and you can characterize this work as an internship
Consider whether a job requires a security clearance - those take time and you may need to seek other employment while you wait for the security clearance
Many government organizations work with contractors, so even though you work at a government agency, youâre actually paid by the contractor - this can be a good first step into a government administration job
Networking is key - jobs arenât often posted

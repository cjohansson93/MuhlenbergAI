Women’s soccer scores second upset, takes share of first place 


Another day, another upset over a nationally ranked opponent for the Muhlenberg womens soccer team. 

Only this one meant a little more: it vaulted the Mules into a virtual tie for first place in the Centennial Conference.

Muhlenberg (8-5, 5-1) topped Johns Hopkins, ranked No. 7 by D3soccer.com and No. 9 by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, 2-0 in Baltimore, putting it into a virtual tie with the Blue Jays (11-3, 6-1) for the top spot in the CC standings three days after beating No. 16 Swarthmore.

Having just beaten Swarthmore, we were positive coming in, said senior Christina OGrady. We think weve got a good squad and we proved it tonight.




Hacker has tied her career high with 10 points this season. Three of her four goals have come in CC games.



With rain coming down all game, the teams played a scoreless first half. In the second it was a trio of seniors that carried Muhlenberg to victory. Kimberly Hacker gave the Mules the lead in the 55th minute on an assist from Jennifer Lynch, and OGrady added an insurance goal in the 82nd minute.

Muhlenberg had lost seven straight against Hopkins and had never won at Homewood Field. The win snapped the Blue Jays 24-game home unbeaten streak and was their first loss in CC play since September 29, 2007.

In addition to the weather, the game was also complicated by a late start because the Muhlenberg-Johns Hopkins field hockey match-up went into overtime. Though neither side put a shot on goal in the first half, the Mules did not feel it had any effect on their play.

We discussed that possibility and came in expecting it, said OGrady. It was a positive first half for us, and we really picked it up after the first 20 minutes. We started connecting and doing the things we wanted to do.

Things really turned positive for Muhlenberg in the second, beginning with Hackers goal just under 10 minutes in. She lifted a shot from just outside the 18 over the goalkeeper and under the crossbar to give the Mules a 1-0 lead.

It was a great shot, said OGrady. That changed the whole momentum of the game and got us very excited. 

Hopkins next four shots were all on net, but sophomore Michele Toher turned three of them away and freshman Maggie Neary made a defensive save to keep the Blue Jays off the board.

With the Mules clinging to a 1-0 lead in the 82nd minute, OGrady dribbled down the right side, beat a defender and fired a shot to the far post that found its way into the back of the net.

It was a lucky shot, said OGrady. But that was the icing on the cake for us.

It also made Muhlenberg just the second team to score two goals on Hopkins, which entered the week ranked 13th in Division III in goals-against average, all season. The other was No. 1 Messiah.

With four games remaining, a share of first place and a leg up on the Blue Jays, the Mules are in prime position to host the CC playoffs for the first time since 2003.

Were determined to finish out the season with wins, said OGrady. Were hoping we can host this year.

Baseball Can’t Overcome Early Hole




The Muhlenberg baseball team made another attempt at coming back against Swarthmore, but fell short again and dropped its sixth straight game, 12-5.

On Tuesday, the Mules (18-14, 2-8) entered the ninth inning trailing by five runs and got the tying run to the plate. Muhlenberg faced another five-run deficit this time and got the tying run on base in the seventh, but the Garnet (18-10, 4-6) got out of the inning and put the game out of reach with six runs in the eighth.

Freshman Chris Manfredonia singled to lead off the sixth, extending his hitting streak to 16 games and starting a two-run rally that cut a 5-0 Swarthmore lead to 5-2. 

After the Garnet tacked on a run in the seventh, the Mules scored three in the bottom of the inning on an RBI double by junior Joseph Vila and a two-out, two-run single by senior Nick Busillo.

Vila (above) went 3-for-4, recording his 100th career hit with an infield single in the fourth.

A weekend in which the Muhlenberg track and field team is sending members to three different meets began on a positive note with three personal bests at Kutztown’s Mondschein Multi.

Senior Michael Baer finished ninth in the decathlon out of 21 athletes who started and 17 who finished. His total of 5,217 points eclipsed the mark of 5,153 he set last year and was just 14 points short of third place on the program’s all-time performance list.

In his first collegiate decathlon, sophomore Scott Reutter placed 13th with 4,213 points, good for ninth on the performance list.

Junior Tara Keegan (below) was eighth out of 15 competitors in the heptathlon. She scored 3,682 points, 142 more than she did in her first decathlon last year, to jump into second place on the performance list.

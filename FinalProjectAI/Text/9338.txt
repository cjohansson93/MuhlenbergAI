Muhlenberg College Exceeds Goal for Capital Campaign



Muhlenberg College has successfully completed its $105 million comprehensive campaign, The Talents Entrusted to Our Care.Artistâs Reception: September 15, 4:30 - 6 p.m.


	 Wednesday, August 4, 2010  11:45 AM

The campaign, which was the largest, most ambitious in Muhlenberg's history, exceeded its goal and finished with a total of $110.4 million raised by the June 30, 2010 deadline.
The total money raised for each of the three campaign initiatives is as follows:
1)      Endowment ("The People Entrusted to Our Care"): $39.2 million 2)      Capital Projects ("The Places Entrusted to Our Care"): $34.9 million 3)      The Muhlenberg Fund ("The Experience Entrusted to Our Care"): $36.3 million
Campaign highlights of lead gifts and projects include:
Endowment

Muhlenberg met a challenge gift from The Atlantic Philanthropies Foundation and received a $10 million grant for building projects.
Richard "Doc" D. Williams, M.D., Class of 1939, formerly of Slatington, Pa., left the College $7.2 million in his estate to endow scholarships for students.  The largest gift from an individual in Muhlenberg's history has benefitted 35 students in the two years that scholarships have been awarded.
The Century Fund, of Allentown, Pa., made gifts totaling more than $1.6 million for endowed scholarships and general financial aid during the campaign.  In addition, the foundation made a $300,000 gift to name the Century Arch of Muhlenberg's new science building.
Former head of Miers Insurance in Allentown, William "Bill" Miers '49 and his wife, Virginia, made a gift to fully fund an endowed chair in entrepreneurial studies. 

Capital Projects

Thanks to lead gifts from Chairman of the Board Richard Brueckner '71 and Laurie Cameron Brueckner '72, parents of 2004 and 2010 graduates; and former Chairman John Heffer and Barbara Heffer, parents of a 1996 graduate; the Kresge Foundation; and hundreds of gifts from alumni, parents and friends, the College raised $13 million to fund the Life Sports Center.
The late Sarkis Acopian, of Easton, Pa., made a capital gift to fund the Acopian Center for Ornithology in the new science building, as well as a gift to endow an assistant position.
The Trexler Trust, of Allentown, Pa., made gifts of $800,000 and $500,000 toward the Trexler Tower of the new science building and the newly renovated rehearsal house, respectively.  The foundation also gave $200,000 toward student scholarships.
A $1 million anonymous gift from a Muhlenberg parent led the way to financial support from alumni and parents to fund the expansion and renovation of the College's Hillel House.

The Muhlenberg Fund

Faculty/staff giving at Muhlenberg is particularly strong: more than 60% of faculty and staff members made campaign gifts in Fund Year 2009-2010.
Parent participation during the final seven years of the campaign averaged approximately 66%.

The College will finish a major addition and renovation to Seegers Union this summer.  Other strategic initiatives that the campaign helped fund were 10 new academic positions, increased student/faculty research grants and several faculty development grants.  The $39.2 million that was added to Muhlenberg's endowment helped to fund endowed professorships, scholarships and general financial aid.
"We are extremely grateful to our wonderful alumni, parents and friends," says College President Randy Helm.  "Without tremendous support from people who believe in this institution, this would not have been possible.  It is especially heartwarming to see so many people provide gifts during such difficult economic times."
The College will celebrate its successful campaign with a series of events this fall including a faculty/staff celebration brunch on August 26; a campus-community celebration for the opening of the Seegers Union on August 29; and an invitation-only black-tie optional gala on October 30, 2010. The cast of Beatlemania will be the headline act at the gala.

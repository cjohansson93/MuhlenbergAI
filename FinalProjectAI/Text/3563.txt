Sophomore Lexie Daniells led off the 4x400 relay team and also placed second in the 200 and seventh in the 55.





Vaughn finished second in the 55 meters. His time of 6.69 second ranks fourth on the all-time performance list.



Just like Mother Nature cant seem to go more than a few days without dumping more snow on the region, the Muhlenberg track and field teams cant compete in a meet without making an impact on the all-time performance list.

But while the snowfalls last hours and hours, some of the top performances take but a few seconds.

Outstanding sprinting performances by junior Peter Rice and freshman Stephanie Carnevale highlighted a solid all-around team effort at the Muhlenberg Invitational.

Rice ran the second-fastest 55 meters in team history, winning in 6.59 seconds  12 hundredths of a second off the school record set in 1995. Carnevale became the fifth athlete in team history to run the 55-meter hurdles in less than nine seconds; the other four all were national qualifiers at some point in their careers.

Carnevale (who also placed second in the long and triple jumps and third in the 55 meters) and Rice accounted for two of the 10 first-place finishes by the Mules. 

The women did very well in the middle distances and field events. Freshman Nicole Cronin and junior Melissa Ugelow won the 800 and mile, respectively, and the 4x400 relay team also finished first.

Sophomores Colette Faust (high jump) and Tara Keegan (long jump) and freshman Erin Saucier (pole vault) won field events.

Sophomore Isaiah Vaughn in the 200 and freshman Jake Ullmann in the 400 joined Rice as event winners for the men.

Bauer Named Scholar-Athlete of the Year
 Monday, May 12, 2014







					 




Muhlenberg junior Tyler Bauer was named Centennial Conference co-scholar-athlete of the year for men’s track and field.

The award, which was given for the first time in all sports this academic year, goes to the All-CC selection of junior or senior class 
standing who has the highest cumulative GPA. Bauer, who shared the honor with a runner from Franklin & Marshall, is the first Mule in any sport
to earn the honor.

A double major in biology and music, Bauer (right) was a second-team Academic All-American last year and is a candidate again this year.
He earned a spot on the All-CC first team by winning the javelin at the CC Outdoor Championships for the third year in a row and entered
the week with the ninth-best mark in Division III. 

Bauer led a small Muhlenberg contingent at the Swarthmore Final Qualifier by winning the javelin with a throw of 202-3, just a shade off his
season best. 

Three seniors ran season-best times at Swarthmore: Jarrett Felix won his heat of the 800, Amber Lee
Wojtkowski finished ninth in the 100 hurdles, and Bobby McGetrick took more than 22 seconds off his previous season
best in the steeplechase.

Junior Luke Munyan moved up from 10th to ninth on the Mules’ all-time performance list in the 5,000, while freshman
Jaryd Flank missed the top 10 in the same event by less than a half-second.

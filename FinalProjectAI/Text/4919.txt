small track contingenthas super day at esu


After their scheduled meet at Ursinus yesterday was cancelled due to snow, the Muhlenberg track and field teams competed at East Stroudsburgs DeSchriver Invitational with a smaller number of athletes. Those who did make the trip had a great day.

Senior Jennifer Lynch won the mile, narrowly missing the NCAA provisional time by only a little over a second. Her time of 5:06.60 wasnt far from the best time in the Centennial Conference this season, 5:06.43.

Junior Bobby Torphy was the top finisher for the men, coming in second in the 800 meters and setting a new indoor personal record of 1:55.78, which topped the best CC time as of last weekends meets.

Sophomore Kimberlee Yalango cut more than two-and-a-half seconds off her previous personal best in the 800, running a 2:24.35 to place fifth in the meet and land in fourth on the Mules all-time performance list. 

Sophomore Melissa Ugelow set an indoor personal record in the 5,000, finishing third in the long race with a time of 19:23.90, good for seventh on the Muhlenberg performance list.

The all-freshman 4x200 relay team of Amanda Brennan, Mallory Davis, Colette Faust and Tara Keegan came in eighth. Faust set a new personal best in the high jump at 5-2, and another freshman on the womens team, Bre Biondi, became the third Mule to clear 9 feet in the pole vault.

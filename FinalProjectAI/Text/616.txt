Information Systems Management (BIS)

Position yourself in an exciting career in Technology. Information Technology continues to permeate all aspects of our lives.
School, work, government, news, communication, shopping, research, entertainment, personal relationships and more have all been radically transformed by our ability to manipulate and move electronic bits at nearly the speed of light. Even those who choose to avoid technology cannot remain unaffected without a great deal of effort and inconvenience. For individuals pursuing a career in business, either as a consumer or provider (or both) of information services, understanding how the technology is designed, developed and applied in the construction of Information Systems (IS) is especially critical.
There is no escaping the impact of IS, and those who learn to effectively manage and shape it to meet the needs of organizations will be in high demand well into the future. 
Digital disruption continues to impact how organizations operate and deliver value to their customers.  While this disruption creates opportunities for new business models and value-added services for companies, it creates employment opportuntities for IS professionals well-trained in foundational concepts who have demonstrated their knowledge working on "real world" projects.
The Bachelor's of Information Systems degree program offered by the School of Continuing Studies gives its students a foundation relevant to the evolving technologies of the marketplace combined with team-based, practical project work that addresses a wide range of current issues. It combines traditional IS disciplines such as systems architecture, business process engineering, analysis and design, software development and business intelligence with emergent technologies like cloud services, virtual computing, mobile technology, social media and the ânext big thingâ yet to come.

Candidates for this program must have a working knowledge of computers and their applications and be proficient in using communication and productivity tools such as e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software. Students must be comfortable with employing a variety of new and emerging tools on the web to identify and cultivate valid sources of information for independent research activities. While approximately 20% of the curriculum will involve computer programming, prior experience in a programming language, although helpful, is not an absolute requirement. Predictors of success during this hands-on portion of the program include a propensity for logical thinking, technical curiosity, personal initiative and methodical persistence in working towards a correct solution.
As the goal of this program is to prepare students for careers in areas such as information systems management, systems analysis and project management, those with solid problem-solving, analytical and communication skills will be ideal candidates. A minimum of five years work experience and two years of college coursework are typically required. Interviews are necessary for admission.

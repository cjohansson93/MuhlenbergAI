mule women’s soccer places 5 on cc team



For the first time since 2002, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team had five players earn All-Centennial Conference honors.

Junior midfielder Kasey Hacker and freshman forward Nicolette Miller were voted to the first team, giving the Mules two first-team selections for the first time
since 2003.

Hacker (right) has scored a 

career-high 17 points on six goals and five assists and tied for the team lead with four goals in CC games. She leads all active Muhlenberg players
in goals (16), assists (12) and points (44), ranking 10th in program history in points.

Heading into the championship weekend, Miller (left) leads the CC with 26 points and is tied for the league lead with 10 goals. She is the fourth Mule freshman to reach double
figures in goals and the third to be named to the All-CC first team.

Junior forward Christina O’Grady earned second-team honors for the third year in a row. She has 11 points this season and is 11th on the team’s all-time list with 
39 for her career.

For the second time in three years, Christina O’Grady was joined on the All-CC squad by one of her sisters. This time it’s freshman forward Meghan O’Grady,
who received honorable mention along with junior back Samantha Hoffman. Meghan O’Grady has 11 points, and Hoffman – who earned honorable mention for the
second straight year – leads a defense that has allowed 20 goals in 19 games.

Happy Birthday! Volleyball Wins Centennial Opener

Her parents may have surprised her with a visit from Ohio, and her friends may have serenaded her between the first and second sets, but ultimately it was her teammates on the Muhlenberg volleyball team who 




Freshman Lindsay Gambocurta recorded 5 kills and 3 assists.




gave Davi Gordon her best birthday present.

Relegated to the bench by an injury, Gordon, one of 
the team’s three senior captains, watched as the Mules swept McDaniel (25-22, 25-22, 25-11) in their first Centennial Conference match of the season.

Muhlenberg improved its record to 3-8, getting its third win more than a month and 11 matches faster than it did last year. The Mules also made up for a loss to McDaniel last year in their CC opener, which led to an 0-6 start in league play.

Field Hockey Drops CC Opener



The Muhlenberg field hockey team dropped its conference opener, 3-0 to McDaniel.



Junior Kristen Dornenburg made five saves on the night, giving her 301 for her career. She is just the sixth goalie in school history to record at least 300 saves.

first conference win out of the way,” said sophomore Morgan Duggan, who contributed 10 assists, 5 kills, 4 digs and 2 aces, one of which ended the match. “We wanted to get them back for last year because it was a tough loss. It felt great to work together as a team and get it done.”

The Green Terror (0-8) was getting it done at the start, opening up a 10-4 lead.

“We knew they were going to be a scrappy team, so we were ready for their tips at the net,” said Duggan. “We were almost too ready – we were very jumpy on the court. But then we settled down and got going.”

The Mules eventually drew even at 14-14, took the lead for good at 18-17, and finished off the 25-22 win on one of freshman Holly Hynson’s match-high 11 kills.

The second set was tied 18-18 before Muhlenberg ran off six straight points on the serve of freshman Julia Elkin. Sophomore Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare had two solo blocks in the set, one to give them a 24-18 lead and the other to end the set after McDaniel’s 4-0 run.

The third set wasn’t close. The Mules took a 10-2 lead at the start and rolled, 25-11.

Freshman Alyssa Schell led the defense – which held McDaniel to a negative hitting percentage – with a career-high 16 digs. Freshman Nikki Dickson had 14 assists, 5 kills, 5 digs and 2 blocks, and her setting enabled Duggan, the Mules’ normal setter, to play at hitter in the second set.

“I used to hit in high school, so it was nice to get back to that,” she said. “It helps that everyone’s clicking. We’re finding what’s working.”

men’s basketball edges f&m for cc win


An unlikely shot got Ryan Foster and the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team straightened out.

Foster’s three-pointer at the halftime buzzer gave the Mules the

lead for good, and they went on to defeat Franklin & Marshall, 68-65, to snap a three-game losing streak and break into the Centennial Conference win column.

The Diplomats (3-3, 1-1) came back from an eight-point deficit to take a 31-30 lead on a jumper with 16 seconds left in the first half. Muhlenberg (2-3, 1-1) was unsuccessful in setting up a good shot on its ensuing possession, so with the clock winding down, Foster rushed a shot from the right corner with a couple of defenders around him. Swish.

“It was interesting – I couldn’t make any open shots, but I made that shot,” said Foster, who was 0-for-8 from the field before his buzzer beater. “It was good for my confidence. I came out in the second half and made a few shots, and we made that run.”

Ahead 33-31, the Mules opened the second half on an 11-3 run, which included a three from Foster, to take a 10-point lead. Another triple by Foster, with 13:56 left, gave Muhlenberg its biggest lead, at 49-38.

Franklin & Marshall, coming off a win against defending CC champion Johns Hopkins, staged a comeback to make the game interesting. The Diplomats cut the gap to 
three, 62-59, and had a possession with a chance to tie with three minutes left. They missed a shot, and the Mules responded with a basket by junior Mike Bernardini 
and a breakaway dunk by sophomore Peter Barnes, extending their lead to seven with less than two minutes to play.

Again F&M wouldn’t make it easy. The Dips scored the next four points to get within three points heading into the final minute. Foster hit two free throws with 47.4 seconds left for a 68-63 lead, but Muhlenberg missed its next four free throws. With 3.4 ticks on the clock, F&M scored on a putback and called timeout to set up the press.

The Mules tried a long baseball pass, but it was intercepted, and the Diplomats called timeout with five-tenths of a second left. The best they could manage off the inbounds pass was a long three-pointer that fell short, finally giving Muhlenberg a much-needed win after two close losses.

“The first Centennial Conference game against Haverford, we played well but missed shots,” said Foster. “We were disappointed because we knew we could have won easily if we’d made some shots.”

Sophomore Obi Nwizugbo made the most shots against F&M, scoring a career-high 16 points. Bernardini finished with 12, and Foster added 11. Barnes recorded eight points and seven rebounds.

“Each game we’re getting a little better,” said Foster. “For a young team it’s going to take a while to reach our full potential. This is a good step.”

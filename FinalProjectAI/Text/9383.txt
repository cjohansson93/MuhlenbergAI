Muhlenberg College offers a new 3+3 partnership with Villanova Law.
Muhlenbergâs new 3+3 partnership with the Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law will provide qualified students with early access to one of the nationâs top law schools. They will spend the first three years at Muhlenberg earning a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and then enroll at Villanova Law to earn a Juris Doctor (JD) for the final three years, saving a yearâs worth of time and tuition.
âWe regularly receive incredible applicants from Muhlenberg,â says Matthew Saleh, assistant dean for admissions at Villanova Law. âThis speaks not only to the strength of their academic profiles but other important qualities we look for when weâre enrolling a new class. In particular, the goals and values shared by our institutions, including challenging students to develop lives of leadership and service to community, make Muhlenberg students a great fit here.â
âBy actively growing our partnerships with top graduate and professional schools, weâre helping our students map routes to the life and career outcomes they desire,â says John Williams, President of Muhlenberg College. âWe know the personalized, highly-integrative learning we offer prepares students to do well after graduationâand we hear time and again from alumni who say their Muhlenberg education helped them pursue their passions, enroll in top graduate schools and achieve fulfilling careers because the experience at Muhlenberg so strongly encourages integrative and evidence-based thinking. Through programs such as this exciting new partnership with Villanova Law, Muhlenberg is providing a âlife and career GPSâ for our students.â
Muhlenberg has offered dual-degree partnerships for many yearsâagreements to link the collegeâs degree program to a second degree, usually at a larger universityâbut the College has recently more than doubled the number of these partnerships. With the addition of Villanova Law, the College now offers 12 such programs. Fields include medicine, dentistry, physical and occupational therapy, public health, business and engineering, and now law, among others.
Among other criteria, Muhlenberg juniors will be offered direct admission to Villanova Law if they have completed at least three years of coursework, earned a minimum G.P.A. of 3.60 and taken the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) no later than January of their junior year. Muhlenberg seniors are eligible as well. The application fee will be waived for those students who satisfy all the eligibility criteria and students will be considered for traditional financial aid options and will be automatically considered for a guaranteed annual full- or half-tuition scholarship during their three years of law school.
To learn more about the Villanova Law partnership or Muhlenbergâs pre-law advising, please contact Giacomo (Jack) Gambino, professor of political science and prelaw advisor at jackgambino@muhlenberg.edu or the Prelaw Advising office.

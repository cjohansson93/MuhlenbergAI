As an actor, Bernard starred in the BBC film Murder in Oakland and co-starred in Stephen Kingâs Golden Years and also has had appearances on Seinfield and The Cosby Show. 
Bernard is a Cosby survivor-turned-public-figure anti-rape activist who influcenced the abolishment of the statute of limitations on rape prosecution in California as well as the gubernatorial signing of three #MeToo bills on employment sexual harassment and assault. Bernard graduated from The American School in Japan and attended Cornell University and The City University of New York. She received her M.F.A. from Otis College of Art and Design.

Hikes earned a masterâs degree in social work from the University of Pennsylvania and psychology and English degrees from the University of Delaware.

Women’s Soccer Loses on Late Goal


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team had a good start, but Swarthmore had the better finish and won, 2-1, in a rematch of last year’s Centennial Conference first-round playoff game.

The Mules (6-7-1, 4-3) took the first four shots of the game. The third was a hard blast from the right side by senior Stephanie Tramutola. The Garnet goalie got her hands on the ball but couldn’t control it, and senior CJ Graetzer knocked in the rebound for her second goal in as many games.

Muhlenberg hadn’t played a CC game in which both teams scored since 2011, but that odd streak went away when Swarthmore (6-4-2, 2-3-2) tied the game with 26:20 to play. And with just 4:23 left, the Garnet scored the winning goal off a corner kick.

Senior Amanda Wong faced 15 shots in the second half and finished the game with eight saves, several of the diving variety. 

With three CC games left in the season, the Mules still have a four-point lead for the final playoff spot.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team returned to its home court in style, sweeping past Penn State Berks.

The Mules (15-7) dominated throughout, posting a .406 hitting percentage behind strong performances from sophomores Erin Murphy (left) (7 kills in 15 attempts) and Joanne Josephson (8 kills in 14 attempts) and freshman Allison Glass (team-high 9 kills, 12 digs) a day after returning from a Fall Break trip to Memphis.

All 14 Muhlenberg players saw the court in the non-conference matchup, which the Mules took control of from the start. They won 12 of the first 13 points and never looked back, capturing the first set, 25-8, before winning the next two by scores of 25-20 and 25-18.

Junior Nikki Dickson led the way with 16 assists, with sophomore Vanessa Pulice (11) and freshman Ali Mayer joining her in double figures. Sophomore Katherine Boll finished with six kills in 10 attempts, while junior Julia Elkin contributed a season-best eight digs for the Mules, who had 10 service aces and six blocks as a team.

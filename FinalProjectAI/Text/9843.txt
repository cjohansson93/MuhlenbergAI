The academic program in Theatre is designed to provide majors with a thorough background in the history, theory, and literature of performance and frequent opportunities for structured studio experiences in performance and design. Class sizes are limited, and the work is intensive and demanding.
The curriculum is designed to be both rigorous and flexible, allowing you to pursue your interests in multiple theatre and dance disciplines, or in other fields of study entirely. Many of our students take another major or minor in addition to their theatre major. Many also select more than one area of study within theatre â for example, directing and acting â and we have recently overhauled the Theatre curriculum to make this easier than ever.

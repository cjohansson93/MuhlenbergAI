Changing a battery in a live-streaming camera seems a typical intern task: simple, menial, something no one else feels like doing. But when Jake McDaniel â17 was asked to do so in the early days of his summer internship at National Geographicâs Safari Live, he had to get a ride on a 4x4 through Kenyaâs Maasai Mara National Reserve to reach the camera, which was set up along the Mara River. As he fiddled with the battery compartment, a herd of wildebeests (like those pictured at right) made its way across the water nearby. And then, âa lion popped out in front of me and killed two of them,â McDaniel says.
When he wasnât having awfully-close-for-comfort wildlife encounters, McDanielâs time at Safari Liveâwhich is both a twice-daily, three-hour live-stream that airs on social media and a more polished show that airs on the National Geographic Channelâallowed him to use some skills he picked up as a film studies major and creative writing minor while also developing new ones.
âI learned how to do editing, logging and behind-the-scenes production through several video production classes I took at Muhlenberg,â McDaniel says. During his internship, he got a look at what goes into a live-streaming show: Heâd monitor social media accounts to be able to feed viewersâ questions to the wildlife presenters in real-time, for example, or heâd keep an eye on the feeds along the river to alert producers to action happening there. He also edited together this video and wrote this blog post for the showâs Facebook page about his experience.
âPeople who are just trained in âold-fashionedâ film or television will find their options more limited than those who see good storytelling transcending the barriers between film, TV and the internet,â says Amy Corbin, associate professor of media & communication and film studies who taught McDaniel in several classes. âLive stream experience would give training in thinking on one's feet and improvising. It shows an ability to adapt to new forms of media.â
McDaniel returns to Africa for a second three-month stint with Safari Live in December. This time, heâll be in South Africaâs Kruger National Park. Ultimately, he wants to get into scriptwriting, which requires the kind of behind-the-scenes knowledge his internship has helped him gain.
âLearning about the production side of things helps a lot,â McDaniel says. âTo be a good writer, you have to understand the work that goes into making a scene.â

The department strongly encourages students to participate in a study abroad experience. The College, through the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges, offers LVAIC Summer Programs Abroad in German, Italian, and Spanish as well as semester programs in France and Germany. Qualified students desiring to spend their junior year abroad may enroll in approved programs sponsored by other colleges and universities. For further details, students should consult with the chair of the department, their faculty advisor, as well as with the Office of Global Education. Applications for approval to study abroad must usually be filed with the Office of Global Education no later than the beginning of the spring semester of the preceding academic year.

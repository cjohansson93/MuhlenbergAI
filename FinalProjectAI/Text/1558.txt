Langdon Winner, professor of political science in the department of science and technology studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Co-director of the Center for Cultural Design, will present a lecture entitled “Will New Technology Revitalize American Democracy?”at Muhlenberg College on Monday, February 7, 2005 at 7:00 p.m. in the Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. This event is free and open to the public. 
Winner is a political theorist who focuses on the social and political issues that surround modern technological change. He is the author of “Autonomous Technology,” a study of the idea of “technology-out-of-control” in modern social thought, “The Whale and The Reactor: A Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology,” and editor of “Democracy in a Technological Society.”
Winner’s appearance is a part of the series Ethics in the Information Age, sponsored by Muhlenberg College’s Center for Ethics. Through interactive programming, presentations, and classroom activities, the Center encourages investigation of social practices in the local college community, as American citizens, and across diverse cultures.

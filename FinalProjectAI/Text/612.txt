The Essential Skills Employers Value
The Accelerated Degree program is a career-oriented educational adventure that combines knowledge gained in the classroom with real-life project experience. Our curriculum is rooted in developing the "essential workplace skills" so many employers today require.
This includes:

Powerful Communications (spoken and written)
Effective Teaming (both as a leader and team member)
Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
Resilience and Emotional Intelligence.

I would like to schedule an advisement meeting.

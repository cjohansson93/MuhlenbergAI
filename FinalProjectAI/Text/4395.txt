Liddic, Chili among nations scoring elite





Liddic leads the CC in both scoring and rebounding. The last CC player to finish the season first in both categories was Muhlenbergs Jeff Stewart in 2006.





Chili, who has made 224 career 3-pointers, needs just 19 more to become the CCs all-time 3-point leader.





A monster week and a monster game have helped a pair of Muhlenberg basketball players move up in the national statistical rankings.

Juniors Alexandra Chili and Spencer Liddic are both in top 20 in Division III in womens and mens scoring, respectively.

Thanks to a prolific week in which she averaged 27.7 points per game and was named Centennial Conference womens basketball player of the week, Chili moved into the top 10 on the NCAA scoring list. She currently sits in sixth place in Division III averaging 21.8 points per game. Chili is the only CC player in the top 90 in scoring and also ranks seventh in 3-pointers per game (3.2).

Liddic, meanwhile, poured in 35 points against Washington to bring his season average to 21.5 points per game, tied for 20th in the country. He also ranks 22nd in rebounding (10.5 per game) and is one of only six players in Divison III averaging at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per game.

Both Chili and Liddic are also currently the top womens and mens scorers in the CC. Chili is averaging more than five points more per game than the second-leading womens scorer, while Liddic holds a 1.6-points-per-game lead on the mens side. No CC school has ever claimed both the mens and womens scoring titles in the same season.

Liddics teammate, freshman Kevin Hargrove, ranks among the nations best when it comes to blocked shots. Hargrove, who has already tied the school and CC record for blocks by a freshman with 46, is 14th in the country averaging 2.7 blocks per game. He is the only player in the CC averaging more than two blocks per game and has more than doubled his closest competition in the conference. 

Hargrove and Liddic have helped anchor what is one of the stiffest defenses in the country. The Mule men are 19th in field goal percentage defense (38.7%) and 35th in scoring defense (61.5 points per game). Muhlenberg has also controlled the glass for much of this season and ranks eighth in rebounding margin (+8.8 rebounds per game).

The Mule women, meanwhile, are averaging 5.6 blocks per game, good for 14th in Division III and are 30th in turnover margin (+5.50 per game).

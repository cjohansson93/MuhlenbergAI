Women's Soccer Streak Snapped by Scranton
 Tuesday, September 23, 2014 - page 2







					 





The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team had its program-best seven-game unbeaten streak to start the season 
snapped by Scranton, 1-0. The lone goal came with just 1:16 left in regulation.

Making the second start of her career, freshman Rachel Mizrahi stopped six shots to keep the 
Mules (6-1-1) even for more than 88 minutes. Mizrahi made a great diving save on a penalty kick in the 
73rd minute and also had a similar diving rejection earlier in the second half on a point blank shot that 
seemed destined for the back of the net.

The Mules generated some promising chances in the second half, but were unable to find the breakthrough and were shut out
for the first time all season. 


Earlier in the day, Muhlenberg moved up to seventh in the NSCAA regional rankings, its highest position since the 2008
team climbed as high as fifth.

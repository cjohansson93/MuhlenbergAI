The second road game of the season for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team couldn’t have been much different from the first.

Six days after pouring in 95 points and winning by 30 at Swarthmore, the Mules (2-3, 1-1) struggled offensively in a 61-40 loss at defending Centennial Conference champion Haverford.

Muhlenberg trailed only 13-12 with less than nine minutes to play in the first half before going dry, missing its next 13 shots while the Fords (2-3, 2-0) went on an 18-0 run to open up a 19-point lead. The Mules never got closer than 12 points the rest of the way and wound up shooting just 23.5 percent from the field.

Senior Leanna Tallamy (right) led Muhlenberg with nine points and nine rebounds. She and junior Christina Santone (left) each had four offensive rebounds for the Mules, who had a 45-40 advantage on the boards.

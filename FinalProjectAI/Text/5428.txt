mazzola named player of the week



For the second time in four weeks, senior punter David Mazzola of the Muhlenberg football team was named Centennial Conference special teams co-player of the week.

In a low-scoring game where field position was vital, Mazzola dropped all four of his punts inside the 20-yard line in the Mules’ 17-6 win against Franklin & Marshall.
He averaged 46.3 yards on the four boots, and his 53-yard punt to the 6-yard line late in the first half set up Muhlenberg’s go-ahead touchdown and helped turn the 
tide of the game. F&M gained only one yard on punt returns, giving Mazzola a net average of 46.0.

Over the last four weeks, Mazzola has averaged 43.1 yards on 13 punts, with 10 of them landing inside the 20. 

For the season, he ranks third in the CC with his 37.8-yard
average, and he ranks second with 11 punts inside the 20. Muhlenberg leads the CC in net punting.

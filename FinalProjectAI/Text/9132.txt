KEY FINDINGS

Over a year after the 2020 election, voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania remain deeply divided on many aspects of the last presidential election and on the future of electoral processes in the Keystone State.
While 6 in 10 Pennsylvanians who voted in last yearâs election are confident that the election was conducted in a fair way, 4 in 10 reported they are not confident in the fairness of the election, with 24% not confident at all that the election was conducted fairly.
While divided on many issues related to electoral processes in the state, a strong majority (63%) disagree with the claim that the Pennsylvania State Legislature (the General Assembly) should be able to overturn the results of an election after the results had been certified by state and local election officials, with almost half (46%) strongly disagreeing with this potential action.
County election officials are more trusted to provide the state with safe, secure and accurate elections than the Commonwealthâs legislative, executive and judicial institutions. About two out of three (67%) 2020 voters either âstronglyâ or âsomewhatâ trust county officials on election matters, compared with 49% trusting the legislature, 45% trusting Governor Wolf, and 57% trusting the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the realm of election administration.
A majority (57%) of 2020 Democratic voters view voter suppression as the biggest threat to the state having a safe, secure and accurate election in 2022, while most Republicans identified voter fraud (37%) or the use of mail ballots (31%) as the largest outstanding threats to the upcoming midterms.
About 4 in 10 Pennsylvania voters in the 2020 election are either âveryâ or âsomewhatâ confident that there was widespread election fraud in that election, including 7 out of 10 Republicans.
Most (56%) of Pennsylvanians who voted in 2020 believe the events at the United States Capitol building on January 6, 2021were an insurrection against the United States Government. However, about 2 out of 3 (63%) Republicans who cast ballots in 2020 disagreed that the January 6 events amounted to an insurrection against the U.S. Government.
Republican voters in the Commonwealth indicate significantly lower levels of trust and confidence in all electoral processes and state institutions in comparison with their Democratic and independent counterparts. The lower trust extends to Republican-controlled institutions such as the state legislature and to voting processes such as electronic voting machines that were used by the majority of GOP voters in 2020.


METHODOLOGY
The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of (506) 2020 general election voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that was conducted between December 1 and 13, 2021. Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (117) and cell phones (389). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. The data has been weighted to gender, age, party registration, race, educational attainment and 2020 general election voting results to reflect voter population parameters. The calculation of sampling error considers design effects due to the weighting identified above. To reach a representative sample of registered voters both landlines and cell phones were called up to 3 times. The sampling frame for the study is from the registered voters files of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Only voters who indicated that they voted in the 2020 election were included in the sample. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by the staff of the Muhlenberg Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) in conjunction with the staff of Keep Our Republic (KOR). KOR is a national civic education 501(c)3 non-profit. The survey was funded jointly by Muhlenberg College and Keep Our Republic. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or 484-664-3066 or email Christopher Borick, director of the MCIPO, at christopherborick@muhlenberg.edu.

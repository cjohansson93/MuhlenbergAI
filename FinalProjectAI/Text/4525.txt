Mens soccer scores late to drop Fords 



Mike Williams said he was just waiting for Haverfords defense to make a mistake.

So when a Ford defender mishit a clearing attempt in the 81st minute, Williams was there waiting.

The Muhlenberg senior intercepted the ball and sent a rocket past the helpless Haverford goalkeeper. The goal ignited a wild celebration and kept the Mules unbeaten as they topped Haverford, 1-0.

I just kind of anticipated that kid making a bad touch, Williams said. The ball just took a good bounce and I went after it. I had missed one early in the half from seven or eight yards out, so it was good to make up for it.

"We like the drama. Were good at keeping fans on the edge of their seats.

Muhlenberg (9-0-6, 4-0-3) maintained control throughout much the game, but could not touch the back of the net. Both Williams and Josh Luginbuhl hit the crossbar on an evening when the Mules outshot the Fords, 14-1.

The Mule defense kept the ball away from goalkeeper Jason Daniels for much of the night. Muhlenbergs backs did not allow a Ford (7-5-2, 3-3-1) shot on goal and sent most of Haverfords scoring opportunities away.

The game was an intense, physical matchup between two teams that came into the weekend in the top five in the jumbled Centennial Conference standings. And according to senior back Eric Williams, the tough win was just the latest example of the Mules resiliency. 




Williams' goal was his third of the season. That equals his combined total from his first three years.





The last two games weve really shown our character, Eric Williams said. Weve had a lot of ties and people have questioned how good we really were; but weve shown that we have heart.

Muhlenberg remains one of only three unbeaten teams remaining in Division III and has set a new school mark for longest unbeaten streak. The Mules have gone 15 games without a loss, breaking the previous record that spanned the final five games of the 1995 season and the first nine games of the 1996 campaign.

But none of that matters to Eric Williams. He said the Mules have done a good job of staying focused this fall. And he said is nowhere near ready to let his final year end prematurely. 

Weve been setting records all season, but no one really cares, Eric Williams said. Its our senior year and weve got to do it. Weve only got a couple games left; so it is just about doing our best and getting out there and fighting with all weve got.

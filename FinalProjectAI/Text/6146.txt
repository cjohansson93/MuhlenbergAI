Men's Basketball Drops Overtime Thriller
 Saturday, December 3, 2011 - page 2







					 





Liddic took a charge in the final minute of overtime with the Mules trailing by three. With his 14 rebounds, he climbed into sixth place on the Centennial Conference
all-time list with 832 in his career.




The Muhlenberg men’s basketball pulled off one dramatic comeback but not a second and lost to Washington College, 96-93, in overtime.

The loss snapped the Mules’ three-game winning streak and an even longer home winning streak against the Shoremen, whose last victory at Memorial Hall came in the 1989 Scotty Wood Tournament.

The thrilling game featured 11 ties (nine in the second half) and 17 lead changes. Except for a 30-second span early in the second half, neither team led by more than five points in the final 26 minutes.

Washington (3-3, 1-2) had a four-point possession in the final minute of regulation to take a 77-74 lead. Muhlenberg missed a three-pointer on its next possession, but senior Spencer Liddic was fouled on the rebound and made both free throws to make it 77-76 with 37.2 seconds left.

Two Shoreman free throws put the lead back at three. After the Mules (6-2, 1-2) missed another three-pointer, freshman AJ Dean pulled down the rebound and kicked the ball out to sophomore Austin Curry in the corner. Curry’s contested three fell through with 7.4 ticks on the clock, and Washington’s final shot grazed off the front of the rim.

Liddic scooped in a layup along the baseline 16 seconds into overtime to give Muhlenberg an 81-79 lead. Washington scored the next six points, however, to take the lead for good. Curry hit a long three-pointer with 4.8 seconds left to make the score 94-93. The Shoremen added two free throws with 3.8 showing, and the Mules turned the ball over in the backcourt on their final possession.

All five Mule starters scored in double figures. Liddic finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds for his 35th career double-double. Dean scored a career-high 21 points, and Curry had 14. Freshman Malique Killing added 16 points, and sophomore Kevin Hargrove recorded 10 points, nine rebounds and five blocked shots.

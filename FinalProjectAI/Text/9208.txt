Mr. Morten Lauridsen

Ms. Elissa Montanti
Elissa Montanti is the founder of the nonprofit and nonpartisan Global Medical Relief Fund, whose mission is to aid children who are missing or have lost the use of limbs or eyes, have been severely burned or have been injured through war, natural disaster or illness.
Montanti was first called to action after a meeting with the United Nations Ambassador from Bosnia and reading a letter from a child pleading for help after losing both arms and a leg to a land mine in the Bosnian Civil War. She quickly realized the urgent medical needs of refugee children and began recruiting airlines, hospitals, physicians and prosthetic companies to donate their services.
Her mission became more personal when the letter's author, a young boy named Kenan Malkic, and his mother arrived in the United States and were welcomed into Montanti's home. Their four-month stay and Montanti's advocacy provided Kenan with new prosthetics arms and a prosthetic leg, along with a safer life.
Since its founding in 1997, Global Medical Relief Fund has helped children domestically and from nearly 50 nations and is entirely supported by private donations and grants. Montanti and the organizationâs work have been featured in international media, including âPeople,â âNational Geographic,â âReader's Digest,â â60 Minutes,â âBBC World News,â The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.
The Honorable Andrew Young
Andrew Young is a human rights activist, politician, businessman and a professor at Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies.
Young graduated from Howard University with a bachelor's degree in biology and earned his divinity degree from Hartford Theological Seminary. He became pastor of Bethany Congregational Church in Thomasville, Georgia, in 1955, where he became immersed in civil rights and civic engagement.
Young served as a trusted aide to Martin Luther King, Jr. and served as executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the church-centered Atlanta-based civil rights organization led by King. Young taught nonviolent protest and organized voter registration and desegregation campaigns across the nation and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
Following King's assassination, Young ran for and was elected (and twice re-elected) to Georgia's Fifth District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming one of the first black southerners in Congress in the twentieth century. During his terms he focused on the causes of poor and working-class Americans.
In 1977 President Carter recognized Youngâs talents by naming him ambassador to the United Nations. Young made human rights a central focus of American foreign policy, pushing for economic support in developing nations and providing early support for sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa.
In 1981 Young was elected the mayor of Atlanta, succeeding Maynard Jackson, and for the first time a major U.S. city saw transition between African American mayors. In 1985, Young entered a primary bid for Democratic governor of Georgia, and he later served as co-chair of the Atlanta Committee for the 1996 Olympic Games.
Young has been honored by Morehouse College through the naming of the Andrew Young Center for International Studies in March 1998, and he has continued his advocacy work as chair of the Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund, which provides financial services to indigenous small and medium businesses in the Southern African region.

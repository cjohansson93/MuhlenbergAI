Muhlenberg is now one of 32 institutional members of the Liberal Arts Diversity Officers (LADO) consortium nationwide. LADO provides opportunities for chief diversity officers at liberal arts colleges to collaborate and provide leadership in implementing and publicizing effective diversity strategies at their home institutions.
Founded in 2007, LADO member institutions are private, selective colleges with a focus on undergraduates. They must also have a staff member serving in a diversity leadership role.
âThis is an opportunity that came with the creation of Muhlenbergâs diversity leadership position,â says Vick, (pictured left), who joined the College last fall in the new administrative role of associate provost for faculty and diversity initiatives.
âI was impressed with LADOâs goals, and this will be a great partnership for us as we continue to develop our capacity to recruit, retain and support underrepresented faculty, staff and students,â she added.
As a member of LADO, Muhlenberg will also now partner with the Creating Connections Consortium (C3), which is funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. C3 develops, disseminates and promotes new strategies for fostering the full participation of diverse students and faculty. In doing so, it serves as an incubator of innovation for institutional diversity and equity.
The C3 Undergraduate Fellowships program, for example, provides underrepresented students from LADO colleges the opportunity to do paid and mentored graduate-level research, plus helps open doors to graduate schools and internships. This includes training about applying to and succeeding in graduate school.
LADO and C3 representatives also make over a dozen visits to top research universities a year to meet with underrepresented graduate students and encourage them to consider faculty positions at liberal arts colleges. This includes providing information about specific teaching opportunities and the faculty job search process at liberal arts institutions.
Citing the benefits of an effective consortium, Vick says, âThere are things we can do better together than alone, including developing collaborative solutions to shared challenges. LADO will help us do this.â

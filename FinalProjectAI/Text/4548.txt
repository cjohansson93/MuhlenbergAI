OGrady, Plifka earn player of the week honors







After helping their respective teams to a pair of perfect 2-0 weeks, two Muhlenberg soccer players have been named Centennial Conference players of the week.

On the womens side, Meghan OGrady earned the offensive honor after she finished the week with seven points. She scored two goals and assisted on a third in Wednesdays 5-3 win over Moravian. She then added another goal in Saturdays 4-0 shutout against Washington.



The junior forward leads the conference in both goals (9) and points (20), and has also moved into the top 10 in Muhlenberg history in each category. Her 21 career goals are tied for eighth place on the all-time list, while her 49 points are good for a tenth-place tie.







A two-time All-CC honoree, OGrady is the third member of her family to be named a conference player of the week, 








joining her sisters Ashley and Christina, players of the week in 2009 and 2008, respectively.


Kyle Plifka earned the mens defensive honor after he helped the Mules record of pair of shutouts over regionally ranked DeSales and conference foe Washington. Muhlenberg allowed a combined five shots on goal, 11 total, in the two games.






The sophomore back saved a goal against the Bulldogs when he cleared a shot that was headed for the net. That play kept Muhlenberg ahead in what was a one-goal game at the time.



It is the first player of the week award of Plifkas career and fourth for the Mules this season. Muhlenberg leads the conference and ranks in the top 25 nationally in goals against average, surrendering 0.45 goals per game.

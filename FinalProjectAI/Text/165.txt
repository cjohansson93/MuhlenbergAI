The Acopian Center for Ornithology is a unit of the Department of Biology, Muhlenberg College. It was established in 2006 with a bequest from local philanthropist Sarkis Acopian, for whom it is named. It provides a secure facility for the protection and display of its historic 2,500+ piece mounted bird collection, whose specimens average 100 years old and include many threatened, endangered, as well as some extinct species, and its research library, which includes books, journals, and reference works on ornithology, as well as archival and manuscript materials. The latter include the papers of local ornithologists and biologists and some records of local ornithology organizations and activities. In addition to securing its holdings, the Center is building a modem study skin collection and enhancing its research library, both of which are used for community and undergraduate teaching, research, and interdisciplinary studies, such as fine arts. The Center is committed to providing hands-on training in the natural sciences through specialized classes and collection-based research opportunities which are available to Muhlenberg students. The Center is routinely visited by local school groups for natural history studies.

Freshmen Impressive in Debuts


The Muhlenberg volleyball team got some impressive performances from freshmen and oepned its season with a pair of wins against teams from Wilkes-Barre at the Moravian
Premiere Invitational.

The Mules swept Wilkes in three sets and came back after dropping the first set to beat King’s in four.

Freshman Vanessa Pulice led Muhlenberg in assists in both matches, while Chelsea Kaser had the most digs in both.

Freshmen Katherine Boll and Joanne Josephson combined to hit .439 in the King’s match. Boll recorded 11 kills in 22 attempts,
to go along with four aces and three blocks, and Josephson notched 10 kills with only one error in 19 attempts.

A junior, Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare, had 10 kills against Wilkes.

Paced by a third-place finish by senior Samantha Mayden, the Muhlenberg women’s cross country team got its season off to a strong start.

Competing without one of their all-region runners, the Mules came in fourth out of nine teams at the Lehigh Invitational, easily beating the other two Division III
squads in the meet (including Moravian). The only teams to finish ahead of Muhlenberg were two from Division I (Delaware and Lehigh) and Division II Kutztown.



The men came in eighth out of 10 teams, three points better than Moravian.

Mayden, who came in seventh at the same meet last year, trailed only two runners from Delaware to earn a t-shirt as a top-10 finisher. Her finish was the best ever
by a Mule at the season-opening meet at Lehigh.

Senior Erica Bash came in 20th, improving her time from last year’s Lehigh Invitational by 78 seconds. 

Sophomore Luke Munyan (right) was the top finisher for the Muhlenberg men’s team, coming in 31st.

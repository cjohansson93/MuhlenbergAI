Volleyball Splits Two Matches in Memphis
 Saturday, October 12, 2013 - page 3







					 





During the first set of the Muhlenberg volleyball team’s match against Rust, a dig attempt by the Mules went backward and rattled around the rim of one of the side baskets in Rhodes College’s gym. The Mules followed the bouncing ball, stayed with the play and were able to get the ball back over the net – and eventually win the point.

The rest of the match was a slam dunk for Muhlenberg.

In the second of two matches on the first day of competition on their Fall Break trip to Memphis, the Mules swept Rust in record fashion, 25-8, 25-7 and 25-5. Muhlenberg’s six-match winning streak was snapped with a 3-1 loss to Birmingham-Southern in the first match.



Against Rust, the Mules (13-6) set a school record for fewest total points allowed in a match (20) since the advent of 25-point sets in 2008. The previous mark was 35 in a sweep of Cedar Crest last year.

Muhlenberg also set school records for best hitting percentage (.520) and most service aces (23) in a three-set match. 


Senior Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare (left) led the Mules with six aces – her first since 2010. Sophomore Vanessa Pulice added five, and sophomore Katherine Boll had four, including three in a row in the first set.

Junior Lindsey Gambocurta and freshman Allison Glass each had six kills in only seven attempts. Sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller recorded kills on all four of her hits. The Mules made only six attack errors (none in the third set) while allowing Rust only five kills.

The first match was much more competitive. Birmingham-Southern (16-4) broke away from a 17-all tie in the first set to win 25-20, but Muhlenberg took the second, 25-19. Down 19-11 in the third set, the Mules closed to within 21-20 before the Panthers stemmed the tide.

The fourth set turned on a disputed point in which the line judge called a Muhlenberg serve in for an ace but was overruled. Instead of being tied at 14, the Mules trailed 15-13, and Birmingham pulled away to close out the match with a 25-18 win.

Junior Holly Hynson led the attack with a season-high 13 kills. Freshman Ali Mayer (right) notched her second straight double-double with team highs of 19 assists and 11 digs.

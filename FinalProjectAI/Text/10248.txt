Under normal circumstances, the families of intensive care unit (ICU) patients spend hours at their bedsides, talking to their loved ones (even if theyâre unconscious), playing their favorite music and holding their hands. Families find comfort in giving this support and patients can be responsive to receiving it. Elisa Vicari â08, a licensed clinical social worker at North Shore University Hospital in Long Island, New York, has witnessed this firsthand. Vicari acts as a guide to her ICUâs patients and their families, supporting them during the patientâs stay, helping to coordinate discharge plans in the best-case scenarios and connecting loved ones to funeral planning resources and grief support groups in the worst.
In early March, Vicariâs role became even more significant. Within a week of the first COVID-19 patientâs arrival in her ICU, all 18 beds were filled with âthe sickest of the sickest COVID patients.â
âWithin the blink of an eye, it seemed like the whole hospital was consumed by the virus,â says Vicari, who was a psychology major at Muhlenberg. (More than 20,000 COVID-19 patients had been admitted to the Northwell Health system, of which North Shore is a part, by early June.) âWe knew weâd be hit, but I donât think any of us understood how rapid it was going to be.â
The hospital, like many others, barred visitors, though two per patient were allowed for end-of-life situations. To help bridge the gap, Vicari posted on social media asking whether anyone had an iPad to donateâthe hospital had some, but not nearly enough to facilitate videoconferencing for all the COVID-19 patients who were coming through. Within a week, sheâd received 20 iPad donations for the hospital as well as $11,000 in donations to buy more.
Meanwhile, Vicari tried to fill in for loved ones in the wake of the no-visitor policy. In FaceTime sessions with families, she asked for specifics about each patientâwhat they liked to eat, the names of their loved ones and pets, their favorite songs. When sheâd visit with the patients, sheâd use specifics from those conversations (ex: âyou have to get home to see Rover!â) to provide personal support. She would FaceTime families from a patientâs room and hold the patientâs hand while loved ones talked to them from the iPad.
âMy patients mostly were not able to speak or interact, but it was important for their family to see them, give them love, see theyâre safe and cared for and have that visual picture of where their loved one is,â she says. âI have a greater appreciation for the power of being with loved ones in critical illness situations. I watched people respond so differently when they saw their families via FaceTime.â
She also served as the contact for family members coming in for an end-of-life visit: coordinating the timing, dressing them in protective equipment and accompanying them into the room for the patientâs final moments. She would bring in the iPad so more loved ones could say their goodbyes virtually. (Vicariâs work was featured in a New York Times story about one of her patients.) Though end-of-life visits are always difficult, she says, some of these families hadnât seen their loved one in five or six weeks. They were coming into the hospital for the first time to see their loved one for the last time. This added a layer of distress and fear not typically present in these situations.
Three months after the whirlwind began, it seems to be at least on pauseâVicariâs ICU now has no COVID-19 patients. Limitations on visitors remain in effect, as do strict personal protective equipment requirements. Still, Vicari finally feels like she has a moment to take a breather and to reflect on what just happened.
âI witnessed a lot of devastation, but also a lot of really amazing things, incredible things, illnesses people were able to come out of,â she says. âI truly believe I was able to witness some miracles.â

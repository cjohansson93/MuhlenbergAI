Natalie (Kulp) Hand ’78, P’07, formerly a leadership gift officer at Muhlenberg College, has been named the College’s new director of alumni relations.  She became active in her new role April 1.
“I am delighted to have Natalie join the alumni relations team in this capacity,” said Rebekkah Brown, vice president for development and alumni relations.  “During her tenure at the College, she has demonstrated outstanding leadership, work ethic and passion for Muhlenberg as she built relationships throughout the community.  Natalie distinguished herself among a highly qualified group of applicants throughout the search process and joins a team of exceptional alumni relations professionals within the department.  I am confident that together they will further enhance the opportunities for alumni to connect with their alma mater.”
Hand, a resident of Macungie, Pa., graduated from Muhlenberg College in 1978 and joined the College’s development staff last year.  She has an extensive professional portfolio, with 25 years of experience in the nonprofit sector and philanthropic field in national, regional, and local levels.
Prior to coming to Muhlenberg, Hand served as the director of grants for The Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia for 14 years, where she was responsible for securing grants from private foundations, corporations and government funders.  She also worked for 10 years at Meridian Bancorp as vice president of corporate community relations and corporate philanthropy in Berks and Schuykill counties. 
Hand was also employed by the City of Philadelphia, as the director of Art in City Hall; the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania, as the director of development and public relations; and the National Endowment for the Arts as a program specialist for the museum program and the theatre program.
In 1991, she earned certification from the professional development program at the Center for Corporate Community Relations at Boston College.
In her new role as director of alumni relations, Hand will be responsible for planning and implementing programs and activities that engage the College’s 20,000+ alumni with their alma mater in ways that strengthen Muhlenberg and enhance the lives of its students, faculty, staff and graduates.
Muhlenberg College is a highly selective, private liberal arts college in Allentown, Pa.  Founded in 1848, it is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

Tuition and Plan Payment Options
As you review your financial aid award, you will notice the Federal Direct Student Loan is the cornerstone to any borrowing that takes place at Muhlenberg College as it offers the best available rates and repayment terms. The balance left after this financial aid award is the balance that needs to be addressed by students and their families.
You may wish to pay the remaining balance in full to Muhlenberg College when you receive your actual bill early in the summer. The best way to limit your debt is to consider Interest-Free monthly payments offered by the Muhlenberg College Tuition Payment Plan administered through Nelnet Business Systems. If the difference between your annual educational costs and available financial aid is greater than what you are able to pay on a monthly basis, Nelnet can assist you with affordability counseling. By limiting the amount borrowed and maximizing the interest-free payment you make each month, Nelnet can help find your best solution.
Monthly Payment Plans and Individual Payments
Muhlenberg College partners with Nelnet Business Systems to offer interest-free payment plans for up to 10 monthly installments. With this option, you have the freedom to use your money to earn your own interest or investment income, while you pay in small installments over the course of the semester(s).
Spreading the balance out into 10 interest-free installments for a fee of only $45 per plan (5 fall semester installments and 5 spring semester installments) is an option that pays for itself and provide a choice to enroll in either or both semesters. The Muhlenberg College Payment Plan offers:

Fall enrollment, which begins June 1st (and continues to the start of the semester.)
Secure online enrollment

Students must use the Application Portal to enter Nelnetâs Enterprise platform to:

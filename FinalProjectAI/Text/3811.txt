rivera leaves muhlenberg after 2 years 



After two seasons as head softball coach, Roni Rivera is leaving Muhlenberg to accept a head coaching position at another school.

 Rivera was hired  in July  2008 and made an immediate  impact in her first season. The Mules tied for the biggest turnaround  in Centennial Conference history and won their first CC championship in  six years,  earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament. She was named CC coach of the year.
 Rivera coached the CC player of the year and led a young Muhlenberg team to a 14-19 record,  including a win against eventual NCAA regional  winner Moravian, in 2010.  
Rivera came to Muhlenberg after three years at Dartmouth College,  where she served as first assistant coach. A 2003 graduate of Santa Clara University, Rivera also held assistant coaching positions   at Mt. Holyoke College and Cal State  Northridge.

Muhlenberg will conduct a national search for her replacement.

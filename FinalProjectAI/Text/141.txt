The interdisciplinary International Studies major embodies the mission of a liberal arts education: cultivating thoughtful, articulate, active, and responsible citizens who are able to apply multi-faceted approaches to understand and address the wide variety of issues facing the international community and its diverse constituencies. By introducing students to the tools of the contributing disciplines â their theories, concepts and research methods â International Studies enables students to explore the power relationships; institutional arrangements; social, economic, environmental conditions; and ideological commitments that shape public policy in a culturally diverse and increasingly interdependent world. The major offers courses and research experiences emphasizing the development of writing skills, critical thinking, and active and intelligent engagement with issues affecting contemporary public life.

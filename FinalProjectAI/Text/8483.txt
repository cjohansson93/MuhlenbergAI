5:00 p.m. Worship will begin again on Sunday, September 5, 2021
 
Chapel worship includes scripture, preaching, music from around the world, and weekly celebration of Holy Communion. Worship is led by students, the College Chaplain, and the Chapel musicians. The Chapel community also offers opportunities for local community service, leadership, fellowship and study.
No matter what your Christian denomination or faith community background is, you are very welcome at Chapel services. Muhlenberg students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and local community members, young and old are welcome. The Muhlenberg Chapel is a Reconciling in Christ organization, welcoming and affirming people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.

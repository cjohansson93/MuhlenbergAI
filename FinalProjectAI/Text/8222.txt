Viamedia produced the spot, and Molly Brown, director of marketing & public relations for The Wescoe School, created the concept and copy.

Established in 1979, the Telly Awards is the premier award honoring outstanding local, regional and cable TV commercials and programs; the finest video and film productions; and web commercials, videos and films.

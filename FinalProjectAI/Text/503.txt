Anthony Cervino
Hurry with the Furies 
March 10 - November 20, 2020
Artist Talk: March 17, 7pm in the Recital Hall 
Public Reception: March 25, 5:30 â 7pm
Hurry with the Furies will feature a suite of works that use the visual and formal language of institutional critique to explore how we fethisize cultural objects.   Cervino's recreated historical objects manipulate material conventions by resulting in humorous, and often transgressive meditations on his personal past.
This exhibition will also include a catalog, with essay by Margaret Winslow. 
Anthony says about his work "As an artist, I am still a committed object maker. Conceptually (and speaking broadly) most of my sculptures draw on personal memory, a sense of cultural nostalgia, and notions of boyhood/masculinity. Visually, I approach these subjects with an eclectic hand. Using both made forms and manipulated found objects, I focus on object-based compositions that tend to investigate conflicting notions of identity such as hero/coward, masculine/feminine, and victim/victimizer, among other formal and abstract considerations. Taken as a whole, my sculptures offer a wistful celebration of everyday possessions and poetic musings on an enigmatic past. My work pay homage to the emotional valences and real histories found in familiar and strange things."
Anthony has been exhibiting for over 20 years and teaching at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania since 2006. His exhibition record includes national and international shows where his artwork has been displayed in a variety of venues including college galleries, museums, art centers, commercial spaces, and art fairs.

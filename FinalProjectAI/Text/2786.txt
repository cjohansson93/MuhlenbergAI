The Muhlenberg soccer teams, both of which clinched the top seed for the Centennial Conference playoffs, had three players honored for their academic work this week.

Seniors Samuel Hayden, Kasey Hacker and Christina O’Grady
were named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point 
average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team. 

Hayden (above center) was a second-team selection. A double major in economics and Spanish, Hayden starts at center back for a Muhlenberg defense that has allowed
only 12 goals in 16 games. He has started every game for the last three years, during which the Mules are 35-14-3 with 28 shutouts in 52 games. A three-time 
Centennial Conference player of the week and two-year captain, Hayden has career totals of three goals and six assists.

Hacker (above right) also made the second team. A media and communication major, Hacker leads all active Muhlenberg soccer players with 56 career points. She is 
third on the Mules this season with 12 points on five goals and two assists. A four-year starter and two-year captain, Hacker was named to the All-CC first team last year.

O’Grady (above left) landed on the Academic All-District team for the third straight year, this time on the third team. A double major in accounting and
finance, O’Grady is tied for 10th in team history with 49 career points on 17 goals and 15 assists. Eight of her 10 points this season have come in CC games. 
O’Grady was a second-team All-CC selection each of her first three years.

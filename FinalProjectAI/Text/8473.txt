Welcome to the Muhlenberg Hillel Family! Weâre so excited to connect with you and to work in partnership with students to create the most inclusive and pluralistic Jewish community, where each student is encouraged and empowered to explore their own Jewish journey.
If you have any questions, thoughts, feelings or concerns, donât hesitate to reach out to Ira Blum at IraBlum@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3244

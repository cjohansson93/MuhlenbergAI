football receives votes in national poll




Men’s Golf Fourth at Bent Creek


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished fourth out of 15 complete teams at the Bent Creek Invitational, hosted by Franklin & Marshall.

Sophomore Biff Slocum tied for fourth with a career-low 72. He is the third different Mule golfer in the last three tournaments to shoot a one-over par.

The undefeated Muhlenberg football team is closing in on the national top 25.

The 5-0 Mules received 48 votes in the D3football.com poll, up from zero the previous week, and were the second team listed as others receiving votes below the top 25.

Curiously, one of the teams that did make the top 25 was No. 24 New Jersey, which lost to Muhlenberg by two touchdowns at home in the first week of the season. The Lions
have won all four of their games since, including victories against nationally ranked Montclair State and Rowan.

Muhlenberg last received votes in the D3football.com poll in Week 2 of the 2005 season. The Mules haven’t been in the top 25 since 2002.

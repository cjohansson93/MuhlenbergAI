Championship Preview

wrestlers hope to end rough yearon high note



The wrestling gods have not been kind to Muhlenberg this year.

Already light on numbers and experience, the Mules have been beset by one injury after another. Their first and last home matches were cancelled due to snow. Because of the

second cancellation, they didn’t get to wrestle their scheduled dual match against Centennial Conference opponent Washington and Lee, a team they beat at one tournament earlier in the season and were within 1½ points of at another.

“Hoo, it’s been rough,” said sophomore 141-pounder Kevin Homan.

Despite all the adversity, which led to a winless dual-meet season, Muhlenberg is looking forward to Saturday’s Centennial Conference Championships at Stevens – as much for this year as for next.

“It’s a rebuilding year,” said Homan. “As bad of a season as we did have, we’re looking at next year thinking if we bring in some guys we might have potential.”

Homan is one of six Mules (along with freshman Matt Parker at 149, junior Keith Swanson at 157, sophomore Kenneth Ludwig at 165 and freshmen Nick Aloia at 184 and Chris Galletta at heavyweight) scheduled to compete on Saturday,
and he may have the best chance of placing. Homan had the best record (4-2) in CC dual meets of any Muhlenberg wrestler. His 12-11 overall record includes four pins and three major decisions.

Swanson is 12-14 overall and went 2-3 in CC duals.

“If we can both place, that would be a good turnout,” said Homan, who was a surprise third-place finisher last year. After dropping his opening bout to a nationally ranked opponent, he came back with three wins in the consolation bracket, including a pin of the No. 2 seed.

“At this time of year, anything can happen,” he said. “People might have trouble making weight, or they might be injured. Everything changes.”

The Mules might just be due to have some good fortune come their way.

Football hangs on at hopkins


The defense didn’t make all the plays it wanted to, but it made the big plays and the Muhlenberg football team escaped Baltimore with a 28-23 win at Johns Hopkins.

The win extended the fifth-ranked Mules’ regular-season 



Caporoso’s touchdown was the first of his career and gave the Mules the lead for good, at 14-10, with 7:37 left in the second quarter.



streak to 15 games, the second longest in Centennial Conference history. Combined with losses by Moravian (to Dickinson) and Ursinus (to Gettysburg), it left Muhlenberg as the lone team with no CC losses this season.

Muhlenberg won despite allowing 511 total yards, including two touchdowns of more than 80 yards, and nearly giving up an 18-point fourth-quarter lead.

Senior Eric Santagato was responsible for 



In addition to notching his sixth career interception, Mazzola punted four times for a 44.0-yard average, downing one punt at the 1-yard line and another on the 5.



all four Mule touchdowns, throwing for three and running for the other. Senior John DeLuca rushed for 143 yards, and junior Phil Cresta caught seven passes for 133 yards.

The Mules (4-0, 2-0) were ahead 28-10 entering the fourth quarter when the Blue Jays (3-2, 1-2) began mounting a comeback. Hewitt Tomlin and Sam Wernick, who teamed up for a 91-yard touchdown in the second quarter, hooked up on an 81-yarder on a flea flicker with 12:37 left. 

After Muhlenberg was stopped on fourth-and-1 at the 23, Hopkins drove 77 yards in 10 plays to cut the gap to five on a 12-yard touchdown run.

The Mules’ next drive went backwards 14 yards, and after a punt the Blue Jays took over at their own 39. They were into Muhlenberg territory five plays later when senior Brandon Doyle picked off Tomlin. The Mules took over with 2:48 left and ran out the clock.

Doyle also intercepted a pass in the end zone in the third quarter, stopping a long Hopkins drive without any points, and broke up three other passes.

Tomlin threw for 387 yards but was picked off four times. In addition to Doyle’s two interceptions, senior Matt Rathbun picked off a pass for the third straight week, setting up the first touchdown with a 44-yard return, and senior David Mazzola intercepted a pass at the end of the third quarter.

Santagato, who totaled 203 yards through the air and 49 on the ground, scored on a 12-yard run and threw scoring strikes to senior Joe Caporoso (15 yards), sophomore Bobby Bushong (20 yards) and Cresta (34 yards). Bushong’s TD came on the first reception of his career.

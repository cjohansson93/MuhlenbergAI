Second-Half Woes Doom Men's Basketball vs. Johns Hopkins

Three days after coming back from a halftime deficit to pick up a conference win, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team had the tables turned against it by Johns Hopkins. 

The Blue Jays outscored the Mules by 29 in the second half to erase a 10-point halftime deficit and hand Muhlenberg a 75-56 loss in Memorial Hall.

The game started out close with neither team being able to go in front by more than five during the first 15 minutes. But the Mules closed the half on a 15-4 run, fueled by three layups each from senior Spencer Liddic and freshman Malique Killing and a jumper from sophomore Brian Leeds, to take a 38-28 lead into the break.

But Hopkins stormed out of the locker room, hitting 10 of its first 12 shots to pull in front. The Blue Jays’ hot streak continued as they shot 62 percent from the field with six 3-pointers in the second half to close out the win.

Liddic (right) led the Mules with 17 points and 11 assists for his 37th career double-double. The 11 rebounds moved him into second place in Centennial Conference history with 870 boards, just 77 away from the CC record.

Killing reached double figures for the 11th time in 12 games with 16 points, and sophomore Kevin Hargrove added 11.

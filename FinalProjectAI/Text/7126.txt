Football Uses Big Plays to Topple Dickinson
 Saturday, November 2, 2013 - page 2







					 



A week after using a ball-control offense to run a school-record 97 plays at Juniata, the Muhlenberg football team took to the big-play attack and rolled to its fourth straight win, 42-3 against Dickinson.




The touchdown was the first of Connolly's career. He also caught a 16-yard pass for a first down on the final drive of the first half.




The Mules (6-2, 5-2) scored six touchdowns, and four of them were on passes of 30 yards or more. Of the six scoring drives, only two lasted more than four plays. 

Leading the charge were freshman quarterback Nick Palladino and junior wide receiver Cody Geyer, who teamed up on a 62-yard pass play to open the scoring with 
6:22 left in the first quarter and a 58-yard play on the first play of the second quarter. Each also added a rushing touchdown.

Palladino finished 15-of-18 for 255 yards and three touchdowns while playing just one series into the second half. Geyer accumulated 218 all-purpose yards (204 of which he had midway through the second quarter), 
catching seven passes for 151 yards.

The defense, meanwhile, held the third-best rushing attack in the CC to 80 yards on 45 carries. The Red Devils (3-5, 3-4) gained only 185 total yards and punted nine times.

Junior Greg DeLade made seven tackles and had one of the Mules’ four sacks, while junior Kevin Cellary also recorded seven stops and freshman John Feaster 
recorded his team-leading fourth interception of the season.




Junior Jeremey Thomas made five tackles, including two for loss.





Junior Connor Winter was a perfect 6-for-6 on extra points to tie the school and Centennial Conference record for consecutive PATs made (53, dating back to a miss in last year’s Dickinson 
game). He also punted five times with an average of 40.0 yards per kick and had touchbacks on three of his kickoffs.

The teams traded punts on the first four possessions of the game before Palladino found Geyer behind the Dickinson secondary on the left sideline for the 62-yard touchdown. 
It was the fourth straight week that Geyer had made a play of 60 yards or longer.

Dickinson put together a 12-play drive on the next possession, but a 48-yard field goal attemptwent wide left with 30 seconds left in the first quarter. Two plays and a change of fields later, Palladino and Geyer hooked up on their second long touchdown.

On the sixth play after Feaster’s interception, Geyer bounced outside on a jet sweep and ran 24 yards into the end zone for his second rushing touchdown in as many weeks.

Dickinson got on the board with a 24-yard field goal with 1:51 left in the half, but Palladino engineered a two-minute drive that ended with his 10-yard scoring run with 24.3 ticks on the clock.

Palladino threw a 31-yard scoring pass to junior tight end Michael Long early in the third quarter, and senior Joe Carlucci capped the scoring with a 40-yard scoring strike 
to junior Brendan Connolly with 6:29 left to play.

Palladino and Carlucci combined to pass for 366 yards as the Mules rolled up 506 yards of total offense.

Football Comebacks Fall Short in Loss at F&M
 Saturday, September 14, 2013 - page 2







					 






Flynn contributed to both interceptions, snagging this one (the second of his career) and pressuring the quarterback on a safety blitz on Cerbo's pick.




The Muhlenberg football team tried unsuccessfully to come back from two 14-point fourth-quarter deficits and dropped its Centennial Conference opener, 28-21.

The Mules (1-1, 0-1) took a 7-6 lead into the locker room at halftime but trailed 21-7 early in the fourth quarter. Freshman Nick Palladino, who came on in relief in the third quarter, brought Muhlenberg to within a score by throwing a 54-yard touchdown pass to junior Cody Geyer with 12:17 to play.




Palladino passed for 85 yards and also was the Mules' top rusher with 41 yards on eight carries.



The defense stopped the Diplomats (1-1, 1-0) on three plays following the long pass and the Mules took over near midfield, but Palladino’s fourth-down pass was batted away. Three plays later, F&M scored to go up 28-14.

Muhlenberg responded with its longest drive of the day, going 65 yards in 13 plays to close to within a touchdown again on Palladino’s 6-yard run with 4:23 left.

After another F&M three-and-out, the Mules gained possession on their own 32 with 2:35 on the clock but could not get a first down. The Diplomats took over on downs and ran out the clock.

F&M had advantages of 461-239 in yards and more than 17 minutes in time of possession, but Muhlenberg was able to stay close thanks to some timely defensive plays. Junior Chris Flynn intercepted a pass at the Diplomat 22 late in the first half, and two plays later senior Joe Carlucci hit a wide-open Geyer with a 19-yard touchdown pass to give the Mules their first lead at 7-3.

The Diplomats drove into Muhlenberg territory on their first drive of the second half, but junior Tyler Cerbo squelched the drive by picking off a pass in the end zone for his first career interception.

Geyer caught four passes for 126 yards, including the first two touchdowns of his career. Flynn added 11 tackles to his pick, and junior Gene Blanco recorded a career-high 10 tackles, including a sack.

Hynson Helps Power Volleyball Past Washington

Ojo-Ohikuare was one of six Mules who recorded at least five kills against the Shorewomen.



Although Christmas is more than two months away, the Muhlenberg volleyball team had a Holly jolly time at Washington.

Freshman Holly Hynson recorded 18 kills with only one error in 29 attempts for a phenomenal .586 percentage as the Mules came back after dropping the first set to defeat the Shorewomen, 3-1.

The win was Muhlenberg’s third straight in the Centennial Conference. With an overall record of 6-12, the Mules have matched their win total from all of last season.

“We want to compete,” said sophomore Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare, who had five kills in 10 attempts. “It’s great to win, but it’s more important for us to have that oomph, that drive.”

The Mules came out with plenty of oomph in the first set, opening up a 6-1 lead and forcing the Shorewomen (9-9, 0-5) to take a timeout. The home team regrouped and took the set, 26-24.




Duggan has dished out at least 20 assists six times this season, including four of the last five matches.



“After losing that first set, I guess every girl took it personally,” said Ojo-Ohikuare. “We kind of made a decision to take a stance and go after it since we knew what was on the other side of the court.”

Hynson really went after it in the second set, recording seven kills, including four straight at one point to extend Muhlenberg’s lead from 11-8 to 15-8. Hynson also polished off the set with a kill, giving the Mules a 25-16 match-tying win.

A kill by Hynson also ended the second set, a 25-17 win, and added a pair of kills in the fourth set as Muhlenberg took the match by winning, 25-21. Her 18 kils were the most by a Mule freshman since 2002.


“Holly is a really smart hitter and very reliable. She knows when she can go up and rip the ball, and she knows when to be more cautious,” said Ojo-Ohikuare. “She’s really a good asset to our team.”

Senior Jackie Price continued her run on strong play with 12 kills, including a putback of a Washington overpass to end the match. She has 56 kills in her last five matches, reaching double figures four times after having recorded at least 10 kills only once previously this season.

Senior Brooke McQueen added eight kills, and sophomore Morgan Duggan (25) and freshman Nikki Dickson (22) combined for 47 assists. Freshman Alyssa Schell led the defense with 19 digs.

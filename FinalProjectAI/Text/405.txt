 James Abbott McNeill Whistler     (American, 1834-1903) St. James Street, 1878 Etching
  Whistler captured the feeling of a busy street in this etching, St. James Street from 1878. In St. James Street, Whistler demonstrates his sustained interest in vertical compositions, calligraphic economy of line, and mastery of tonality. This work serves as a fine example of the artist’s unique and unrivaled position in the history of printmaking. Muhlenberg’s example of this Whistler print is from the fourth state. This version of the print, in its fourth state, was published in London’s Vanity Fair magazine in 1878..

Teaching Interests
I teach primarily because I believe in the craft, the psychological gestalt, the world encounter that I have discovered in art and I find the engagement with students deepens those elements both for them and for myself.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy work has taken various directions over the years as I see the primary language as an abstraction whether working from life or from conception. This allows a fluidity of response to the directions my interests have driven me, sometimes even within the same piece.

When the Muhlenberg track and field teams run on the banked track at the Armory, you can bank on them having some outstanding performances.

It was no exception at the 2011

Lafayette-Rider Games, the first of three scheduled trips for the Mules to New York City.

Junior Peter Rice ran three terrific races, shattering his own school record in both the 200 and the 400. His time of 22.40 in the 200 converts to 22.65 on a flat track, besting his previous mark of 22.95. In the 400, Rice knocked a half-second off the record he set on the same track last year, lowering his time from 50.15 to 49.66.

Rice also ran the 


anchor leg of the 4x400-meter relay team, chasing down a Moravian runner to give Muhlenberg a fourth-place finish.

Senior Bobby Torphy posted the highest finish for the men's team, running a personal-best 4:16.33 in the mile to place second. He also was fourth in the 800.

The best finish by a Muhlenberg runner came from sophomore Samantha Mayden, who won the 3,000 meters for the second time this season. Her time of 10:22.50 (10:24.20 converted) is second on the Mules' all-time performance list and an improvement of more than 16 seconds from when Mayden won the 3,000 at Lehigh three weeks ago.

Also landing on the performance list for the women were freshman Nicole Cronin, third in the mile, sophomore Erica Bash, fourth in the 800,
junior Ashley Greenberg, second in the 5,000, junior Melissa Ugelow third in the 5,000, and sophomore Lexie Daniells, fifth in the 400.

For the men, sophomore Brendan Smith (second), senior Ryan Wilson (sixth) and freshman Bobby McGetrick (ninth) all climbed
or entered the performance list in the 5,000. Freshmen Jeffrey Phillips and Andrew Onimus both entered the top-10 list in the 400.

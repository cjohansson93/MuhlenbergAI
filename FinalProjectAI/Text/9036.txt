Classroom Connections
Each semester, as part of its co-curricular mission, the Center offers grants to faculty who pledge to link their courses to the Center's thematic programming. Although faculty build these linkages in a variety of ways, most ask their students to attend those Center programs of particular relevance to the class. Then, they then follow up with written assignments, classroom discussions, readings, or sometimes even research intended to get students thinking reflectively about how these programs connect to other materials and topics in the course.

The Paul C. Empie Theatre is the venue for large musicals, the annual Master Choreographers concert, and other performances. With seating for 392, the Empie features flexible space with excellent acoustics and a sophisticated computerized lighting system.

The excellent acoustics and large orchestra pit in the Empie Theatre allow us to produce large-scale musicals there with full orchestra and no amplification â reminiscent of Broadway's Golden Era, and excellent training for students of musical theatre.
The Baker Center for the Arts was built in 1976 with funding from Dexter F. and Dorothy H. Baker, two of the Lehigh Valley's most generous patrons of the arts. Designed by world-renowned architect Philip Johnson, the building features a 220-foot, glass-covered galleria, bisecting the structure. The building houses the Art, Music and English Departments and the Martin Art Gallery, in addition to theatre facilities.

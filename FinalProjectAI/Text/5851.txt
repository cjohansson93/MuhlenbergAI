The Mules dropped a 3-2 heartbreaker to 15th-ranked Elizabethtown
on the second day of the Mule Classic. 

Seniors Kelly Shetron and Jillian Duffy scored goals, one in each half, both giving Muhlenberg a one-goal lead. The Blue Jays came back to tie both times, the last with 6:16 left in regulation.

The Mules dominated the two overtime periods, taking nine shots to two for Elizabethtown, but could not find the back of the cage. The Blue Jays took advantage of a penalty corner to score the game-winning goal with 7:57 left in the second overtime.

Junior Michelle Consiglio made six of her nine saves in the first half to keep Muhlenberg in the game. Junior Kristin Garbutt added a pair of defensive saves.

Welcome to college soccer.

Four freshmen 



Sophomore Kate Morrissey needed to make only one save to record her first career shutout.




playing in their first collegiate game scored a point as the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team opened the 2007 season with a 4-0 win against Gwynedd-Mercy in the first round of Kean’s Cougar Classic.

The decisive win was a far cry from last year’s game against the Griffins, when the Mules came back from a late 2-0 deficit for a dramatic 3-2 win. Muhlenberg outshot Gwynedd-Mercy, 19-3, and used 25 players in the game.

The freshmen were part of the difference. Valerie Patriarca became the first freshman in program history to score two goals in the first game of her career. She began the scoring at 26:10 on a breakaway assisted by sophomore 
Kasey Hacker, then capped the scoring in the 11th minute of the second half when her shot from the left side deflected off the keeper. Classmate 
Diana Ortiz assisted on the second goal.

Freshman Kassandra Kist and sophomore “veteran” Ashley O’Grady also scored their first career goals.

The four-goal win to start the season tied a team record, set against Misericordia in 1999 (4-0) and tied against Cabrini (5-1) two years ago.

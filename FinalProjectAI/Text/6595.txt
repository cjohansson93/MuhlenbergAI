Field Hockey Wins on Shorthanded Goal

Women’s Soccer Loses 1-0

  
Three days after posting a 2-0 upset win against nationally ranked Johns Hopkins, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team returned to a more familiar score.

The Mules played their fifth 1-0 game of the season, falling at home to Scranton on a goal late in the first half. Scoring chances were minimal for both teams, with
a total of 10 shots in the game.

Muhlenberg’s defense has allowed only three goals in its last 391 minutes. Since the opening game of the season, the only team to score more than one goal against
the Mules has been top-5 Messiah. Below, sophomore Krissy Fioretti uses her head to win a ball.

Barber's goal was the fifth of her career.




Down but not out: After dropping two games in a row, the Muhlenberg field hockey team defeated Widener, 1-0, scoring their only goal while down a player.


Junior Erin Cummings was sidelined for five minutes after receiving a yellow card midway through the second half, but the stubborn Mules refused to let Widener take advantage of the situation and, ironically, used it to their benefit.


“In general we definitely play more defensively when we’re down a person,” said senior co-captain Devon Barber. “It’s usually the opposite outcome in that when one team is in a man-down situation, the other team capitalizes. We got a really great fast break and took advantage of that.” 

During the man-down situation, Barber put one away for her first goal of the season. Junior Dayna Hovern had the assist.

While Barber’s goal gave the Mules (5-3) the lead, the play at the other end of the field ensured that the they maintained it.

Muhlenberg’s defense did not allow a single shot in the first half and allowed just seven shots in the second half, despite 15 penalty corners by the Pride (1-7). Senior goalie Kristen Dornenburg made three saves for the Mules.

Muhlenberg got another yellow card with about two minutes remaining in the game. The defense did its job again, preventing Widener from taking advantage in the final minutes. In addition to the two yellow cards, four green cards were given out in the physical contest.

The non-conference win was an important one for the Mules in terms of ending their two-game skid and getting back on the winning track for their upcoming Centennial Conference matchups.

“After our last two games we tried to think about what we were doing that changed from our play in games at the beginning of the season. I personally thought our practices weren’t as intense,” said Barber. “The past few days our practices were so much better, with more intensity and more communication. It was our practices that gave us a confidence boost coming into tonight’s game.”

This confidence certainly came through as Muhlenberg recorded its first shutout of the season.

“I definitely think we supported each other more all over the field tonight. We always had someone behind if a mistake was made,” said Barber. “We definitely played our small passing game more, which is how we transition the ball up the field most effectively.”

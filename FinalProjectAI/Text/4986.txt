MEN’S BASKETBALL SPREADS THE WEALTH IN WIN 


Late in the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team’s game-clinching 15-2 second-half run, senior Peter Barnes completed one of the more uncommon basketball feats.

Barnes was fouled as he hit a layup, then missed the ensuing free throw before rebounding his own shot and drawing another foul on a layup. Barnes completed his second chance at a three-point play, scoring five points in the span of three seconds.




Frankoski drove to the hoop for all four of his field goals.



“That’s definitely a rarity,” said senior Brian Frankoski. “It was really impressive.

“But he’s a lot bigger than everybody else, so I wouldn’t give him too much credit,” he joked.

That’s also because there was plenty of credit to go around in Muhlenberg’s 85-67 victory over Washington. Six Mules scored in double figures, the first time that has happened since the 2004-05 season. Seniors Ryan Foster and Obi Nwizugbo had 14 and 11 points, respectively, and Barnes, Frankoski, sophomore Spencer Liddic and freshman Rob Berish each had 10.

“Offensively, we just tried to push the ball in transition and use our size inside,” said Frankoski. “We had wide-open lanes and were moving the ball well and hitting our three-pointers.”

Foster opened the scoring with one of those three-pointers, sparking a 14-0 Muhlenberg run to open the game. The Shoremen did not get on the board until the 13:06 mark and trailed by double digits for most of the first half, but stayed within striking distance in entering the break down 45-34.

A 7-0 Washington run in the first 1:09 of the second half cut the Muhlenberg lead to just four. But after Liddic hit two free throws for the Mules’ first two points of the period, Foster went on a tear, hitting two threes, a layup and a pair of free throws for a 12-2 Mule run.




In addition to his three double-doubles this season, Liddic was just one rebound short of the feat in two games and one point shy in another.





“At halftime we addressed the fact that they weren’t going to quit,” said Frankoski. “They made their run, but we were able to maintain our composure and stick to the plan.”

That plan included a fast-paced transition game, as the Mules (3-3, 2-0) sent long outlet passes off of defensive stops to the other end for easy layups. After Washington pulled to within 10, those easy buckets set off the 15-2 run that sealed the win.

“When we get out and run like that, we look like a pretty good team,” said Frankoski.

Foster finished with three of the Mules’ nine triples. For the game they shot 64.3 percent from beyond the arc and 53.1 percent from the field. Muhlenberg held Washington (2-4, 0-2) to just 37.7 percent shooting and controlled the glass, outrebounding the Shoremen 43-26.

Frankoski added eight assists on the offensive end, and Liddic posted his third double-double of the season, pulling down 11 boards to go along with his 10 points.

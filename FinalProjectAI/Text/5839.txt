Playing without its regular setter, Muhlenberg snapped a three-match skid with a 3-1 win at Bryn Mawr.

Sophomores Brittany Williams and senior Megan Young alternated at setter, combining for 38 assists. Young took the final two games, which the Mules won to
pull away from a 1-1 tie.

Senior Jess Anselmi led the attack with 18 kills, while sophomore Liz Leslie added 11.

Field Hockey


Muhlenberg bounced back from Saturday’s Centennial Conference loss at Johns Hopkins to beat Scranton, 3-1, in a non-conference road goame.

All three of the Mules’ goals came off penalty corners, and senior Kelly Shetron was involved in all three. She assisted sophomore Kristen Sabia on the first one,
then broke a 1-1 tie with her eighth goal of the season 11 minutes into the second half.

A little more than a minute later, Muhlenberg (11-4) was awarded another corner, and senior Nikki Rhoads blasted the ball in from the top of the circle.

Junior Julie deLaurentis recorded a defensive save for the second straight game.

Freshman Valerie Patriarca turned a scoreless game into an easy win as fast as 1-2-3.

Patriarca scored her first career hat trick 



Patriarca leads the Mules with 10 goals, four short of the school record for freshmen.




in a span of 96 seconds to lead the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team to a 7-0 victory at Bryn Mawr.

“Beating this team was a big step toward getting into the Centennial Conference playoffs,” Patriarca said. “The entire team played really well throughout the game. The opportunities were there and we just took advantage of them.”

With the victory, the Mules (7-4-3, 4-2-1) now have 13 points in seven conference matches, putting them in a tie for fourth place with three games to play. 
The top five teams at the end of the regular season advance to the playoffs.

After a scoreless first half hour, Patriarca latched onto a deflected pass and scored the opening goal from the top of the penalty box 30:41 into the game. 
Just 43 seconds later, she struck again, beating the Bryn Mawr goalie to the right post after receiving a low centering pass from Christina O’Grady. 
Patriarca completed her hat trick 48 seconds later with a close-range header to the top corner of goal off of a cross by sophomore Jayne Condon.

The hat trick was the first by a Muhlenberg player since 2003, and the first by a Mule freshman since 1997.

Freshman Rachael Goldstein scored on a turnaround shot from 15 yards that went in off the post less than two minutes after Patriarca’s third goal to give the Mules 
a 4-0 lead that would stand until halftime.

Sophomore Kasey Hacker scored off a cross from Stacey Zimmer early in the second half, and freshmen Diana Ortiz and Christine Van Hise 
completed the scoring with their first career goals. 

The seven goals tied for the third-most in team history. Muhlenberg last scored seven goals in a game against Dickinson in 1999.

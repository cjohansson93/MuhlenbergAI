Men’s soccer seniors win for parents


As the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team honored its senior players, those seniors paid tribute to the people in their lives who were there before the college soccer career, who coached them, gave them rides to practice and had hugs when maybe they didn’t play quite so well.

Muhlenberg’s seven seniors took the field with their parents watching and defeated Haverford, 5-1, scoring three of the goals in the first 16 minutes of the game.

“We played that much 



Andrew Brick (26) and his fellow seniors (Carroll, Dalton, Gogel, Leischner, Tenenzapf and A.J. Barnold) have an excellent four-year record of 44-19-5, a .684 winning percentage.





harder, knowing they were in the stands,” said senior Brendan Carroll, who scored Muhlenberg’s first goal less than five minutes into the first half.

Carroll’s goal was assisted by classmate Greg Leischner, but he might’ve had a little more help — from his mother. (corrected 10/27)

Women’s Soccer Plays F&M to Draw



The last home game for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team started out memorably, then took a dramatic turn for the worse before ending in a 3-3 tie with Franklin & Marshall.

The Mules (9-4-3, 4-2-2) opened up a 3-0 lead with 16:54 left in the first half when freshman Meghan O’Grady finished a 1-vs.-1 with the Diplomat keeper. O’Grady entered the game in the 12th minute, replacing Erin Mills, who was given her first career start on Senior Day, and paid immediate dividends. She assisted junior Jayne Condon on the opening goal of the game four minutes later.

Junior Kimberly Hacker also scored as part of Muhlenberg’s three goals in 11:41.

F&M (8-4-2, 4-3-2) needed less time to get it all back, scoring three goals in just 7:18 to draw even with 3:18 left in the first half.

After combining for six goals in the wild first 45 minutes, the teams could not score another in the last 65. The Mules owned a 20-6 advantage in shots and had several good chances in overtime but could not capitalize.

The result did nothing to clarify a congested Centennial Conference playoff chase. The Mules and Dips are still tied for fifth with 14 points apiece. Seven teams battling for the bottom four playoff spots (behind Johns Hopkins) are separated by just five points with one week left in the regular season.

watches Brendan, “I help him kick the ball. I’m always doing the moves, helping him get it in.”

Carroll’s father Brian, who has coached Carroll since he was four, loves the atmosphere at Muhlenberg’s soccer games. “I love when the lacrosse players are on the sidelines, yelling things,” Brian Carroll said. “They’re so bad. But in a good way.”

Carroll’s goal was the first of five for the Mules. Senior Billy Dalton also notched one, on a beautiful one-timer off a cross from fellow senior Steven Tenenzapf. Dalton also had an assist on Muhlenberg’s third goal by junior Eric Miller.

Sophomore Tom Reilly and freshman Cody Antonini also found the back of the net for the Mules, who scored five goals in a half for the first time since 2005. The victory put Muhlenberg (11-4-1, 4-2-1) into a tie with Dickinson for third place in the Centennial Conference with two games to go.

Senior goalie Joseph Gogel kept Haverford scoreless in the first half before he was replaced early in the second. His mother was at the game.

“It’s very important that she’s here,” said Gogel. “She’s come to a million of my games over the years and it’s nice she can come to see these near the end of my career.”

“I’m so proud. He’s really good,” said Gogel’s mother, Brenda Ferrarini. “He’s a great person and goalie and it’s been fun to see him play at each level.”

When asked if she gets nervous, Gogel’s mother replied, “Absolutely. I curse a little. As the goalie he has a lot of pressure and I live that with him.”

Because his mom understands the pressure he faces, he knows he can always turn to her. “I know I can always go to her for a confidence booster,” said Gogel.

Her words of advice? “Just play hard and do your best. Sometimes you don’t get everything perfect, but that helps you build to the next level. I really believe that you carry sports’ lessons through life.”

The Mules will start using these lessons in the world outside of soccer soon enough. The season is winding down and the seniors’ parents know how important these last games are. “He’ll be able to do this for three or four more weeks,” said Brian Carroll. “Then the rest is just memories.”

Two members of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team set personal bests at the Swarthmore Last Chance Meet, both in the 1,500 meters.

Junior Samantha Mayden, who entered the night ranked 38th on the NCAA Division III performance list, improved slightly from 4:38.32 to 4:37.86.
Sophomore Nicki Cronin knocked more than two-and-a-half seconds off her previous best, lowering it from 4:46.50 to 4:43.87.

Senior Peter Rice (left), who was 43rd on the performance list in the 400, finished fourth, although he did not improve his time.

The Mules’ javelin throwers enjoyed success at Swarthmore. Freshman Tyler Bauer (39th on the performance list) had a strong series and 
was the only competitor to throw more than 50 meters on all six attempts. He finished fourth. Junior Tara Keegan placed fifth.

Junior Erica Bash (800) and sophomore Stephanie Carnevale (100 hurdles) also competed.

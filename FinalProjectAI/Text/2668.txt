gearin named to academic district first team


Recent Muhlenberg graduate Sara Gearin was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division 
cross country/track & field first team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the Academic All-District team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.2 cumulative grade-point average 
and a starter or significant reserve on her team.

As a first-team selection, Gearin will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America honors.

Gearin, who graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa as a psychology major, was a national qualifier in cross country as a senior. 
She placed 15th at the NCAA Mideast Regional, earning all-region honors, and she scored three top-10 finishes, with a best of fourth place out of 203 at the DeSales 
Invitational. In track, Gearin holds school records in the indoor 1000, 4x800 and DMR. She earned three career silver medals on relay teams at Centennial Conference 
championship meets.

Gearin owns the rare distinction of having lettered in three varsity sports; she played soccer as a sophomore.

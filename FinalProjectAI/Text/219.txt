Forms & Instructions for Student Researchers  |  Available Research Assistant Positions

Get Involved with Research in the Department
Research Collaboration with a Faculty Member
Many students (freshmen through seniors) work with faculty members as research assistants and collaborators. Students may volunteer their time in a research lab, they may enroll in the Psychology Apprenticeship course (PSY270; .5 course unit), or they may receive Independent Research credit (PSY970). For information about the research being conducted by each faculty member in the department, check here to see who is currently recruiting students to work with them on research. You can also visit the . If you are interested in the research described, contact that faculty member and see if they have room in their research lab for an enthusiastic, responsible new member!
Independent ResearchHave your own idea for a research project? Contact the faculty member with expertise most closely related to your interests and ask if they can serve as a mentor for Independent Research (PSY970). Students work closely with a faculty mentor in developing and implementing their ideas. Any type of research, but especially independent theses such as these are also very positive additions to a graduate school application. 
Psychology Senior Thesis Program & Graduation HonorsQualified psychology majors may apply for a year-long thesis program featuring advanced, original research. The program is developmental in that it seeks to offer intellectually curious students an intensive year-long experience of mentorship and collaboration. To be part of this program, students must be willing to invest considerable time and intellectual energy. Students interested in more general research experience are encouraged to, instead, speak with a professor about coordinating an Independent Research project. Successful completion of a thesis and a psychology GPA of 3.7 or better are both required for departmental graduation honors. For more information visit the Senior Thesis information page.

Research Awards and Funding
Departmental Research Awards
Both of these awards, funded by generous donors, are typically granted in conjunction with a senior thesis project. As such, applications for the awards are part of the senior thesis application process.
Rosenberg Research AwardThe Rosenberg Research Award provides a stipend to a psychology student who is engaged in research that is developmental in nature (either directly or indirectly). 
The Crist Family Research Fellowship The Crist Family Research Fellowship provides a stipend to support students in either independent or collaborative research with a faculty member of the psychology department. 
 College Funding Sources
Harring-Wittenbraker Fund for Student Research This endowed fund provides students with financial support associated with the direct costs conducting or presenting research. For example, funds may be used to pay the costs of gathering data and information, purchase necessary equipment, computer fees, copyright fees, or travel to conferences to present research results. A preference is given to students conducting research in the humanities and social sciences, followed by students conducting research in the natural sciences. For more information or to apply, contact the Dean of Academic Life.
Dean's Office Summer Research Grants These grants are intended for students who plan to engage in research or independent study that will lead to publication, presentation, exhibition, or performance. They are not normally granted for participation in formal coursework, formal study abroad programs, or internships. Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a stipend for eight weeks of research during the summer and one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with campus housing (based on double occupancy). Students may not have other obligations (work, course work, etc.) during the period of the grant. In addition, the student is expected to be enrolled at Muhlenberg the subsequent Fall. For more information, visit the Summer Grants page.Summer Faculty/Student CollaborationsIn Summer Research Collaborations, a faculty member recruits a student as a research collaborator for the summer.  That is, the student assists in a substantive way with the faculty memberâs scholarship.  A joint application must be submitted by the faculty member and the student. Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a stipend for either four or eight weeks of research during the summer. Optionally, the student may receive up to one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with campus housing (based on double occupancy). For more information, speak with a faculty member and visit the Summer Research Collaborations page.
Dean's Office Travel AwardsThe College can fund student travel to present scholarship, to exhibit artwork, or to perform.  Funding in the past has gone toward local, regional, and national venues of presentation. The awards are competitive. Students wishing to apply can get more information on this page of the Academic Dean's site.
Psychology Department Travel Funds for Professional ConferencesRequests should be sent to the Chair of the Department and include the title of the research, student name and contact information, a brief description of the project, the conference for which expense reimbursement is being sought, and the name(s) of the faculty sponsor. Limit: $200. Funds distributed as available.
 
National Funding Sources
BLHF Scholarship Award(s): Eight (8) scholarships â $10,000 eachThe Boris Lawerence Henson Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 2018 by Taraji P. Henson. The foundation is named in honor of Ms. Hensonâs father, Boris Lawrence Henson, who suffered from mental health challenges as a result of his tour of duty in the Vietnam War. Our vision is to eradicate the stigma around mental health issues in the black community. African-Americans are the least likely population to seek treatment. There is a lack of trust in sharing out of fear of being misdiagnosed and labeled inadequate or weak. We are committed to changing this perception by encouraging those who suffer from this debilitating illness to get the help they need. One of our pillars is to increase the number of culturally competent therapists by offering scholarships to African-Americans who are interested in pursuing a career in the mental health field.
Eligibility:

African-American
College Junior or Senior with a declared major leading to a career as a mental health clinician/provider or,
Aspiring or Current Graduate Student, Doctorate Graduate
Major in psychology, psychiatry, family counseling, social work, or a related field that focuses on mental health
GPA 3.0 or greater
Enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited college or university

Summer Research Programs
Lehigh Valley Health Network Summer Scholars ProgramThe Research Scholar Program provides structured educational research opportunities for undergraduate students. The summer session spans 8 weeks, and the fall and spring sessions span 10 weeks each. Within each session, students apply for positions offered by health network departments. Each position involves a combination of research, as well as professional and clinical observations. The program offers educational experience for students and additionally provides valuable assistance to health network departments. For more information, visit: LVHN
Lehigh Valley Hospital - Hospital Elder Life Program, Allentown PA This is a research driven initiative which may be of interest to Muhlenberg College students who want to work with older adults, but also an opportunity for other students to get more applied research experience. Please contact the Civic Engagement office if you want more information.
NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program ("REU")The National Science Foundation funds this highly prestigious and competitive REU Sites program. An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the hosting university. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where they work closely with the faculty and other researchers. This program allows students to experience first-hand how basic research is carried out on a larger scale than ours here at Muhlenberg. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions.  Note: As you search for REU Sites, be aware that opportunities in the field of psychology are listed under multiple areas, including Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research. Also note that you contact each institution that is offering an REU experience individually to learn about their application requirements, deadlines and program activities. For more information, visit nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/

Field Hockey Wins Game, Matte Award Point
 Tuesday, October 25, 2011







					 


Since she is a resident of nearby Northampton, the Lehigh Valley rivalry between Muhlenberg and Moravian hits closer to home for Shelby Smith than for many other Mule athletes. Actually, it hits in her home: Her mother is a graduate of Moravian.

Smith will have bragging rights in her house at least until the

softball season after helping the Mule field hockey team to a 3-1 win at Moravian.

“It’s definitely a big game,” said Smith. “There’s actually a girl from my high school who I just played against. And this is an important game for all of us because of the Matte Award.”

The field hockey win gave Muhlenberg a 3-2 lead in the 2011-12 Matte Award standings. The annual all-sports competition resumes on Saturday, November 12, with points up for grabs in football, women’s cross country and men’s cross country.

Sophomore Dayna Hovern and freshman Kayleigh Thies teamed up for all three goals against the Greyhounds (9-7).

Five minutes after Moravian took a 1-0 lead, Hovern scored off a

penalty corner when she tipped Thies’ pass off the goalie’s pad and in. Thies knocked in a long cross from Hovern with 11:26 left in the half to put the Mules (5-11) ahead for good.

The goal gave Thies 11 for the season, one short of the school record for freshmen that has gone unmatched since 1986. 

“She’s definitely a strong player, especially in the circle. She’s not scared to take that big shot,” said Smith of Thies. “It’s a team thing; we’re all trying to bump the ball up to her because she can make those big shots.”

Thies assisted Hovern on the final goal, the lone tally of the second half. Click here to watch video of the goal.

Moravian put pressure on Muhlenberg in the remaining 13:48, taking four penalty corners and five shots to none for the Mules, but junior Kristen Dornenburg made eight saves to preserve the lead.

And in a year in which cold weather, rain, or both have been the norm, a win on a beautiful, sunny fall day was something to enjoy for the Mules as they wind down their season. 

“If it could be like this for just one more Friday, it will be fantastic!” said Smith.

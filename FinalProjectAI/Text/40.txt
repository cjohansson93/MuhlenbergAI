Kalliope: Creative Journal Any questions or to send us your submission, email us at  kalliope@muhlenberg.edu
The Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures at Muhlenberg College is proud to sponsor KALLIOPE, a student publication established to provide a creative space for new voices.  Varied in form and keeping with the true meaning of its namesake, Kalliope presents the talented, fresh, and unique voices of the students of foreign languages.  These many voices to which Kalliope gives expression embody the creative spirit of the Muhlenberg College liberal arts tradition.

A Message From the Director:
Welcome to the J. Conrad and Hazel J. Seegers Union, the âhearthstoneâ of Muhlenberg College.
   
Seegers Union was originally dedicated on February 8, 1963, and was designed to accommodate 1,200 students.  The 1963-64 âM book,â which was given to students upon their arrival on campus, states, âAll members of the College community â students, faculty, administrators, staff and alumni â belong to the Union.â âThenâ the Union was described as the âliving room of the campus,â and it still is today.  âThenâ the Union was state-of-the art, and ânow,â it is again state-of-the-art.
Creating it was never just about accommodating the size of our student body, and it shows.  Our goal was to enhance the sense of community on campus by giving the College community a beautiful space to work and live in every day. 
With the expansion and renovation completed in fall of 2010, Seegers Union continues to meet those objectives today in a state of the art facility while maintaining a comfortable, âliving roomâ environment.  Seegers Union serves as a welcoming gathering place for students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni and friends of Muhlenberg College.  Seegers Union is home to a wide variety of departments and student organizations, as well as a thriving venue for programs and activities, and offers a number of valuable services to our community. 
This website has been designed to provide information about the facilities, resources and services available at Seegers Union.
As you explore Seegers Union, perhaps for the first time, I hope that you will enjoy the many amenities, experience chance encounters, engage in some conversation, attend some of the programs and feel comfortable as you become part of the Muhlenberg Community.

Inclusive Activism and the Black Lives Matter Movement: Conversations with Young Leaders
Sponsored by Africana Studies and the Black Students Association
September 21st and October 22nd
The mini-series consists of two conversations oriented around the activist work that young people and students are doing to ensure that Black liberation Movements are inclusive in nature. The conversations will center the work that younger generations are doing to celebrate and support all Black groups, including those that have been left out of many previous conversations, such as refugees; LGBTQ+ communities; people with disabilities; immigrants; and others. There are many problems in our world, but countless young people are doing groundbreaking work to create solutions, and we are excited to speak with and learn from them.
September 21, 6:00-7:30
Advocating for All Black Lives in the Era of Social Media: A Conversation with the Muhlenberg Community about Inclusive Activism, Social Media, and Racism Online
Co-Facilitators & Participants: Dr. Kucik (English, Africana Studies), Prof. Meek (Media/Comm, Africana Studies), and BSA Executive Board Members
This will address how students use social media as a tool for inclusive activism and all that they endure regarding racist comments online. This conversation will serve as a space for students to share the ways that they use social media as a transformative tool for racial justice and to discuss their experiences with â and receive support regarding â the racist vitriol they have faced on digital platforms in response to their inclusive activism. Includes time for Q & A and audience participation. The Zoom link will be distributed via email to the Muhlenberg community in the coming days.

From the Ashes of Relentless Racial Crises Amid COVID-19: Creating a New United States of America.
Sponsored by the Africana Studies Program and the Office of Multicultural Life
September 29, October, 15, November 10, November 17
This event series will grapple with our nationâs dire current moment, in which various marginalized racial and ethnic groups are facing a catastrophic range of crises rooted in the violence of systemic racism that has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to addressing the relationship between COVID-19 and contemporary racial crises facing Asian American, Black American, Latinx, and Native American communities, the series will explore the historical roots of these devastating predicaments. While the series explores the experiences of the aforementioned communities through four individual events, the events are meant to be considered in conversation with each other; taken together, they highlight the need for solidarity as a crucial tool for dismantling many of the systems that uphold racial hierarchies. As the series draws its name from the legend of the Phoenix, a mythological bird that regenerates from its ashes, a portion of each event will focus on the activism of younger generations, including Muhlenberg students, as they work to build a new, just world out of the ashes of the fires of relentless racial crises burning around them.
Tuesday, September 29, 6:00-7:30

men’s tennis falls at moravian



A change in the temperature did not lead to a change in fortunes for the Muhlenberg men's tennis team, which fell at Moravian, 6-3, on an unseasonably warm day for its sixth straight loss.

The Mules got singles wins at the bottom of the lineup from sophomore Ari Nutovits (right), freshman Ben Berkowitz and
junior Ben Cohen. Two other singles matches went to third sets.

The result left Muhlenberg with an 8-4 lead in the 2010-11 Matte Award standings. Remaining contests are in softball (April 14), track and field (April 16)
and men's golf (April 21).

Men’s Golf Tenth: The Muhlenberg men's golf team bounced back nicely after a tough first round and finished 10th at the Mid-Atlantic
Region Invitational at Hershey Country Club.

The Mules were 12th out of 15 teams after shooting a 341 over the first 18 holes. They improved their team score by 15 strokes in the second round 
to leapfrog two teams, including Centennial Conference rival Dickinson.

Men's Golf Ninth at Glenmaura
 Monday, April 14, 2014







					 




A strong second day of competition helped the Muhlenberg men’s golf team finish ninth out of 12 teams at the two-day Glenmaura National Collegiate Invitational.

The Mules lowered their score from Sunday by 30 strokes, carding a 316 to match team champion McDaniel for the second-best mark of the day, two strokes back of Scranton. Muhlenberg finished the tournament just three strokes out of seventh and one shot clear of Gettysburg, one of three other Centennial Conference teams at the event.

Senior Christopher Lucarelli (right) was a big reason for the turnaround, lowering his score by eight shots and firing a four-over-par 75 on Monday. His second-round output was just one stroke off the day’s top performance and gave him a two-day total of 158, good for a tie for 12th overall in a field of 59 golfers.

Two other Mules showed significant improvement in the second round. Freshman David Barkley knocked 11 shots off his score and signed for a 78, one shot off his season low and tied for the 10th-best performance of the afternoon. Senior Chris DiMaio, meanwhile, improved his tally by 12 strokes with an 80 on Monday.

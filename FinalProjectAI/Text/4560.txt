 Men's golf, men's soccer honor

football earns votes in national poll



The Muhlenberg football team received 25 points in this week's American Football Coaches Association Division III national poll.

The Mules, who have won three straight, climbed into the poll after a 30-27 win at defending Centennial Conference champion Johns Hopkins, which had received a vote the previous week.
Muhlenberg's only loss is to 11th-ranked Delaware Valley, whose lone loss is by four points at No. 3 Wesley. Hopkins' only other loss is by four points to Randolph-Macon, which is ranked 23rd.

Muhlenberg is one of two CC teams to receive votes this week, right behind Ursinus (26 points). With Franklin & Marshall and McDaniel having earned votes
earlier in the season, half of the CC's 10 teams have shown up in the national ranking.

This is the third time in four years that Muhlenberg has appeared in the AFCA poll. The Mules were ranked consistently in their CC championship seasons of 2007 and
2008, climbing as high as No. 2 in the latter year.

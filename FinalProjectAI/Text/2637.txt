Today’s Results:


SOFTBALL Dickinson 1, Muhlenberg 0; Dickinson 2, Muhlenberg 1. In a doubleheader dominated by pitching, the Red Devils’ was slightly better.

Junior Lara Kestenbaum allowed only six hits in the opener but was bested by Dickinson’s Allison Jordan. Muhlenberg managed just three hits and 
advanced only one runner into scoring position. It was the latest in a string of hard-luck losses for Kestenbaum, who 
has allowed seven runs in 27 innings in her last four setbacks.

In the second game, senior Katie Vecchione gave up a two-run homer in the first, then allowed three singles the rest of the way. The Mules cut the gap in
half in the third when freshman Alyssa D’Addio singled, went to second on a sacrifice and scored on a dropped fly ball. Muhlenberg put the tying
run on third in the fifth and sixth innings but could not drive it home.

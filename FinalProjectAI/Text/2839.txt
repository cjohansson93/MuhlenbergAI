Faust hits ncaa auto mark at home 


It seems like hardly a track meet goes by where Alex Faust doesn’t break a record or make some kind of history, and the Muhlenberg Invitational was no exception. 

Faust pole vaulted 12-7½ to hit the NCAA automatic qualifying mark, guaranteeing her a trip to the NCAA Division III Championships at DePauw the second weekend in March. Faust came into the meet having made the provisional mark of 12-1¼. After clearing 12-1½ to break her own school and Centennial Conference record, she soared over the automatic height on her third and final attempt. 

As of last weekend, only two vaulters in Division III had qualified automatically. Faust is the 


first athlete in Muhlenberg history – male or female – to automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships in indoor track and field.

To top off her evening, Faust won the 55 meters, tying the school record of 7.57 she set last year.

Faust was far from the only Mule to perform well in the six-team meet. The Mules combined for 10 first-place finishes. Freshman Tara Keegan (left) swept both horizontal jumps, and classmate Amanda Brennan, who came in second in the long jump, won the 55 hurdles.

Sophomore Nicolette Miller placed second in the mile, knocking more than 



11 seconds off her previous best and landing fifth on Muhlenberg’s all-time performance list. Right behind her was senior Jayne Condon, who debuted at No. 6 on the performance list in her first mile as a Mule.

For the men, senior Brendan Kirk (right) and sophomores Andrew Henry and Peter Rice all won events individually – the 55 hurdles, 800 and 400, respectively – before teaming up with senior Bill Ryan to finish first in the 4x400 relay. 

Henry came from behind down the stretch to capture the 800 by 32 hundredths of a second, while Rice provided no such dramatics, smoking the field both in the 400 and as the anchor of the 4x400. His open 400 time of 51.74 was a personal best, and he also finished third in the 55 meters with a time of 6.76 – good for a tie for fourth on the performance list.

In the field events, freshman Ryan Hellings won the pole vault, and sophomore Marc Brookland was second in both the long and triple jumps.

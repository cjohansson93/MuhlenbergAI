two from track teams hit provisional marks



Tennis Teams Sweep McDaniel


The Muhlenberg tennis teams enjoyed a good day at McDaniel, sweeping the Green Terror.

The men picked up their first Centennial Conference win of the season with a 7-2 victory. It was their 26th consecutive win against McDaniel.

The Mule captains, senior Brian Wernick and junior Yoni Farber, teamed up for a win at No. 2 doubles and went to capture their singles matches. Sophomore Wayne Mitchel (No. 3 doubles, No. 5 singles) also earned a pair of wins.

The women were dominant, conceding only eight games the entire match in their 9-0 shutout. Senior Carly Rotfeld and sophomores Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker posted 6-0, 6-0 wins, while senior Madeleine Goldfarb prevailed at No. 6 singles in her first match of the spring.

A little rain and a lot of wind didn’t prevent the Muhlenberg track and field teams from having an outstanding weekend.

Two Mules, senior David Chorney and junior Jennifer Lynch, competed at Princeton’s Sam Howell 



Chorney has broken the school record every time he’s run the steeplechase.



Invitational on Friday night to try to qualify for NCAAs. One made it, and another came close.

Chorney ran the steeplechase in 9:19.03, surpassing the NCAA provisional standard of 9:23.00 and his own school record of 9:24.48. Lynch’s time of 17:39.04 in the 5,000 meters smashed the previous school record of 18:01.34 and just missed the NCAA-qualifying time (17:35.00).

The rest of the squads stayed home on Saturday to compete in the Muhlenberg Invitational. High winds forced the cancellation of the discus, made it challenging for the runners and moved the pole vault and high jump indoors. 

It was indoors in the Deitrich Field House that junior Alex Faust hit the NCAA provisional mark in the pole vault, breaking her own school and Centennial Conference record with a vault of 12-0. (Even though the event was contested indoors, it counts towards outdoor qualifying and records.)

Faust, who also came close to the school record in the 100, was one of four Mules to win an event at the 16-team meet. Freshman Melissa Ugelow won the first race of the day, the 5,000, and sophomore Rob Nihen made it a Mule sweep of the 5K later in the day. Senior Stuart Udis captured the 800.

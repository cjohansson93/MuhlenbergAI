Murphy had three of the Mules' 12 blocks.



While the Muhlenberg volleyball team was busy holding a block party, Allison Glass was doing a little bit of everything to keep the good times rolling.

Glass finished with a team-high 12 kills and 10 digs and the Mules racked up 12 blocks en route to a 3-0 sweep at Scranton. The freshman posted a hitting percentage of .450 and got plenty of help from sophomores Sarah Weyhmuller (eight kills, five blocks) and Joanne Josephson (five kills in just seven attempts) as Muhlenberg bounced back from a sweep at the hands of Johns Hopkins over the weekend.

Freshman Ali Mayer led the way with 18 assists for the Mules, who dropped the first four points of the match before winning 15 of the next 20 and cruising to a 25-15 victory in the first set.

Scranton got off to another fast start in the second set, taking a 6-2 lead out of the gate. Muhlenberg slowly chipped away, however, taking the lead for good on a kill by sophomore Erin Murphy that made it 16-15. Leading 21-19, the Mules closed the set strong, forcing three service errors and locking it up on an ace by Nikki Dickson (14 assists, two aces). Muhlenberg won seven of the first nine points in the third set and never looked back, holding off Scranton and closing out the match with a 25-21 decision.

Junior Lindsey Gambocurta recorded six kills for the Mules, who forced the Royals into 19 errors and a .104 hitting percentage. Muhlenberg, meanwhile, finished with a .385 hitting percentage, including a 17-for-30 performance in the opening set.

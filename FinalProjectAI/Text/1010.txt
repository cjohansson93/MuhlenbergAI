          COVID Booster
  








This past semester we have been fortunate to experience very low levels of COVID-19 transmission on campus due in large part to the high rate of vaccination among our students, faculty and staff. As the more transmissible Omicron variant combines with the waning effectiveness of COVID vaccines over time, we are seeing a rise in breakthrough cases across the country. The current conditions have led Muhlenberg to update our vaccination policy for the spring semester to include boosters.
Muhlenberg faculty and staff will be required to have received a COVID-19 booster shot as of Tuesday, February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible. You are eligible for a booster:

At least five months after receiving your second primary COVID-19 vaccination of Moderna or Pfizer; or
At least two months after completing your single primary COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnsonâs Janssen.

(Those who received another WHO-approved vaccine should consult the CDC guidance on when to get a booster if you were vaccinated outside of the United States.) Students will also be required to obtain the booster shot by February 1 or within 30 days of becoming eligible. This policy update aligns with the CDCâs most recent guidance recommending that âeveryone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot.â In addition, moving forward many health experts believe that the likely definition of "fully-vaccinated" will change to include a third shot.
You may submit proof of your booster by emailing your card to hr@muhlenberg.edu or bringing your vaccine card to HR (3rd floor Haas) during standard office hours.
Previously approved COVID-19 vaccination exemptions for faculty and staff will apply to the booster requirement as well. Approved exemptions do not need to be renewed.
We expect to offer a number of on-campus vaccine clinics after the winter break and will share details once they become available.  However, if you are currently eligible, we recommend you get your booster shot as soon as possible. Please see below for a list of local and national providers offering booster vaccines as well as a list of resources regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. 
We will continue to monitor local and national conditions and to prioritize the health and well-being of our campus community. Based on current data, we are confident that booster shots will provide the most effective means to reduce spread of the virus, protect vulnerable members of our community, and ensure we continue to benefit from the in-person learning and community engagement that are the hallmark of the Muhlenberg experience.
Your efforts, both individual and collective, are the reason we have been successful in keeping our community safe. Thank you.

          Faculty and Staff Vaccination Policy
  








This policy was communicated to faculty and staff on Monday, August 9, 2021.
Vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19 and a path toward a campus environment where all members of the community can thrive. As COVID-19 cases have increased in our area over the past weeks, Muhlenberg has taken a sequential approach, consistent with national, state and local health guidelines, for the health and safety of our campus community as we begin the fall semester. Since the vaccines were first available, the College has encouraged and supported vaccination with on-campus clinics and communications. This spring we implemented a vaccine requirement for our students. Surveys among faculty and staff show that we currently have a higher vaccination rate for these groups than the region or state; however, our local healthcare advisors are recommending a vaccination rate of 90%+ for our campus community. This past week we implemented a vaccine incentive program, offered a vaccination clinic, and we will now require all Muhlenberg faculty and staff employees to show proof of vaccination.
By August 23, 2021, all faculty and staff employees of the College are required to show that they are fully vaccinated, in the process of completing their vaccination, or must have applied for a medical or religious exemption. Faculty and staff employees who are partially vaccinated or who have received a medical or religious exemption will follow the same protocols as unvaccinated students, including weekly testing, masking and physical distancing indoors, and required quarantine periods in the event they have been exposed or tested positive for COVID-19. Absent an approved medical or religious exemption, failure to comply with the vaccination requirement or other safety protocols is a violation of College policy and will preclude further employment with the College. 
Update communicated to faculty & staff on December 20, 2021: Muhlenberg faculty and staff will be required to have received a COVID-19 booster shot as of Tuesday, February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible.

Muhlenbergâs COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements

Why is Muhlenberg requiring the COVID-19 vaccine plus booster? 
As COVID-19 cases have increased, Muhlenberg has taken a sequential approach, consistent with national, state and local health guidelines, for the health and safety of our campus community. Vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19 and a path toward a campus environment where all members of the community can thrive. The vaccines are effective against severe disease and death from COVID-19 and its variants that are currently circulating in the United States, including the Omicron variant. We know that severe illness and hospitalizations overwhelmingly impact those who are unvaccinated. 
Further, Muhlenberg has a responsibility to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus, in Allentown, and in the surrounding area. The viral load, which is directly related to infectiousness, decreases faster for fully vaccinated people than for unvaccinated people. This means an unvaccinated person may be contagious for longer than someone who is fully vaccinated. Because of the higher risk in unvaccinated persons of both infection and transmission of infection, the College is requiring the booster in alignment with the CDC recommendation. Muhlenberg is not alone in this approach, which is in place at our fellow Centennial Conference schools and a number of nearby LVAIC institutions.
This requirement and other safety protocols may be updated consistent with health guidelines.

How do I submit my vaccine documentation?
Faculty and Staff may email their vaccination card directly to hr@muhlenberg.edu or may present it in person to a member of the HR staff during standard business hours. (3rd floor Haas). Proof of your booster must be received by HR by February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible. You are eligible for a booster:

At least five months after receiving your second primary COVID-19 vaccination of Moderna or Pfizer; or
At least two months after completing your single primary COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnsonâs Janssen.

For more information on the COVID-19 booster, please review the COVID Booster section at the top of the Faculty & Staff Resources page.
What should I do if I have lost my immunization card?Contact the medical office or pharmacy where you received your vaccination and request documentation that you received the vaccine. The documentation must include manufacturer, lot number, date of administration and location.
I thought if I was vaccinated against COVID, I would have fewer to no restrictions while on campus. Now I have learned that I still need to mask indoors, even though I am fully vaccinated, including booster. What will it mean to be vaccinated on campusâwill there be fewer restrictions and more freedom for those who are vaccinated?Currently, the Omicron variant is causing an increase in cases due to enhanced transmission, including breakthrough cases of COVID in fully vaccinated individuals. Data indicates that vaccinated individuals experience less severe symptoms and recover from the virus more quickly. Vaccinated individuals also carry a lower viral load than those who are not vaccinated, but they may still contract COVID and may still infect others. Accordingly, if you are fully vaccinated (including booster) and are not experiencing any symptoms, you do not need to quarantine out of precaution. However, you will be required to wear a mask, practice physical distancing and refrain from eating or drinking with others while on campus, for 10 days.


Questions about Exemptions

Will Muhlenberg approve exemptions from the vaccine requirement?To achieve maximum health and safety protection for the campus community, Muhlenberg requires all faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated, with two limited exceptions:

Medical Exemption: Employees need not be immunized if the employee objects in writing to the immunization on medical grounds that immunization may be detrimental to their health. Medical reasons for an exemption generally include the following situations: (1) the individual has a disease or takes medicine that weakens their immune system; (2) the individual has a severe allergy to a vaccine or an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccines; and/or (3) the individual had a prior serious adverse event related to a vaccination. An employee who wishes to request a medical exemption should contact hr@muhlenberg.edu for further instructions.
Religious Exemption: Employees need not be immunized if the employee attests to sincerely held religious beliefs that are contrary to the practice of immunization. Social, political, or economic philosophies, or personal preferences with respect to immunization do not justify an exemption. An employee who wishes to request an exemption due to a sincerely held religious belief should contact hr@muhlenberg.edu for further instructions.


What authority does Muhlenberg have to impose this vaccination requirement?The COVID-19 immunization requirement is consistent with the exercise of Muhlenberg's authority as a private institution/employer to protect the health and safety of the campus community. By requiring the COVID-19 vaccine, Muhlenberg is able to move toward offering the traditional campus experience to our community in a healthy and safe environment.
If I am approved for an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine, what health and safety protocols will I have to follow?Faculty and staff who are partially vaccinated or who have received a medical or religious exemption are required to follow the same protocols as unvaccinated students. These include weekly testing, masking and physical distancing indoors, and required quarantine periods in the event they have been exposed or tested positive for COVID-19. Failure to comply with the vaccination requirement or other safety protocols will be viewed as a violation of College policy.


Questions about Vaccine Safety

Can a COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19?No. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.A. contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19.Source: CDC: Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines
There is a lot of confusing information being spread on social media and elsewhere about COVID and the vaccines. How do I know what is fact and what is fiction?
Check out the CDCâs Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines. Per the CDC, this information is researched, written and approved by subject matter experts, including physicians, researchers, epidemiologists, and analysts. Content is based on peer-reviewed science.

How can I learn more about vaccine safety?You have a number of resources available. Here are a few suggestions:

Contact your primary care physician
Visit Johns Hopkins - COVID-19 Safety
Visit Pennsylvania Department of Health - Vaccine Safety
Contact the Allentown Health Bureau: 610-437-7760




COVID-19 Vaccination General Information

Where can I go to learn about local, state and nationwide vaccination rates?Visit the CDC's Vaccination Tracker
If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. Thatâs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possibleâalthough rareâthat you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a stronger boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19 than antibodies alone. Learn more about why getting vaccinated is a safer way to build protection than getting infected.If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.If you or your child has a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. Learn more about the clinical considerations of people with a history of multisystem MIS-C or MIS-A.Source: CDC: Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines
Where can I receive the vaccine?The vaccine is readily available throughout the nation with many pharmacies, urgent care centers, hospital systems such as LVHN and St. Lukeâs and county health departments offering the vaccine. If you are unsure how to locate a vaccine provider in your area, check this CDC website.
Will Muhlenberg offer COVID-19 vaccine clinics?The College offered multiple COVID-19 vaccination clinics in 2021 and plans to offer a number of booster clinics in 2022. COVID-19 vaccinations also remain readily available (see question #2 above), through health networks, local and national pharmacies, medical clinics, and the Allentown and Bethlehem Health Bureaus.
If I am fully vaccinated or in the process of completing my vaccine series, but two weeks have not passed since my final dose, can I still come to campus?Yes, you can come to campus. You will need to follow the guidelines for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals until you are two weeks past your final dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Those are: weekly testing, masking and physical distancing indoors, and required quarantine periods in the event you have been exposed or tested positive for COVID-19. Failure to comply with the vaccination requirement or other safety protocols will be viewed as a violation of College policy.
What if I test positive for COVID-19?The COVID-19 information page includes instructions on what to do if you or a family member have a COVID-19 exposure. If you test positive for COVID-19, report the result to Human Resources as soon as possible. Human Resources will then provide instructions on next steps including contact tracing, stay at home instructions, etc.

I tested positive or was identified as a close contact. What do I do now?

I donât feel well and think it may be COVID, what should I do?Do not come to campus if you are feeling unwell. If you suspect you may have COVID, contact your primary care physician for guidance and also contact Human Resources as soon as possible (hr@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3165). You may find more information on COVID-19 symptoms as well as a symptom checker and information on how to determine if you testing is appropriate on the CDCâs website.
What if I test positive for COVID-19?
If you test positive for COVID-19, report the result to Human Resources as soon as possible (hr@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3165). Human Resources will then provide instructions on next steps including contact tracing, stay-at-home instructions, etc.
You will be required to isolate at home for at least five days. If you have no symptoms or you have symptoms that are resolving, you may return to work, but must wear a well-fitting mask and avoid eating or drinking with others for an additional five days after your test date (test date is day 0). And as always, practice physical distancing. If your symptoms are not resolving after five days, you should continue to stay home until symptoms are resolving and stay in contact with HR. Note: âResolvingâ means your symptoms are improving and you have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication. Some symptoms like a cough may stay with you for a week or more. Itâs not necessary to wait until the cough is totally gone.

How is a âclose contactâ determined?COVID-19 spreads between close contacts when someone talks, coughs or sneezes. A close contact is defined by CDC as someone who was less than six feet away from an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic cases 2 days prior to positive specimen collection). HR conducts contact tracing when advised by a faculty or staff member that theyâve tested positive for COVID and will reach out to any impacted individual(s) directly.
What happens if I am identified as a close contact?If identified as a close contact of a campus community member who has tested positive for COVID, Human Resources will contact you to discuss next steps. You will be offered COVID testing on campus at the Health Center, which should occur on Day 5 following your last contact with the individual who tested positive. (Contact date is Day Zero)Situations may vary based on circumstances, but the following provides a general overview:

If you are fully vaccinated (including booster): You do not have any quarantine restrictions and may come to work so long as you are not experiencing any symptoms. However, you will be required to wear a well-fitting mask and avoid eating and drinking with others for ten days. And as always, practice physical distancing. If you develop symptoms, you should stay home, and get tested.
If you are not yet eligible for the booster but recently completed your initial vaccine series: If you received your second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines within the last five months or had the J&J vaccine within the last two months, you do not have any quarantine restrictions and may come to work so long as you are not experiencing any symptoms. However, you will be required to wear a well-fitting mask and avoid eating and drinking with others for ten days. And as always, practice physical distancing. If you develop symptoms, you should stay home, and get tested.
If you are eligible for the booster but have not yet received it: You will need to quarantine at home for a period of five days. If you have no symptoms, you may return to work after five days, but must wear a well-fitting mask and avoid eating or drinking with others for an additional five days. And as always, practice physical distancing. If you develop symptoms, you should stay home and get tested.
If you are partially vaccinated or unvaccinated: You will need to quarantine at home for a period of five days. If you have no symptoms, you may return to work after five days, but must wear a well-fitting mask and avoid eating or drinking with others for an additional five days. And as always, practice physical distancing. If you develop symptoms, you should stay home and get tested.


What if Iâm not identified as a close contact, but am still concerned about exposure?If you are not identified as a close contact, you are welcome to follow the same guidelines as fully vaccinated close contacts on our campus â wear a well-fitting mask, avoid eating or drinking with others, physical distancing, and self-monitoring for symptoms. If you develop symptoms, you should stay home and get tested.
Is a negative test required before I can return to work?It is possible to test positive for COVID for a period of time following your initial positive test results, even though you are no longer symptomatic or contagious. Instead, follow the guidance on when to return to work, as noted above.
I have some more questions about Muhlenberg policy. Who do I contact?Please reach out to Human Resources at 484-664-3165 or hr@muhlenberg.edu.

Additional Questions

What if I contract COVID-19 and it affects my ability to complete vaccination?Please consult with your primary care provider and contact Human Resources.
After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test?No. Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection.If your body develops an immune responseâthe goal of vaccinationâthere is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results.Source: CDC: Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines
How is a âclose contactâ determined for follow-up?A close contact is defined by CDC as someone who was within 2 meters of an infected person for at least 15 minutes within a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic cases 2 days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.
What if Iâm not indicated as a close contact, but am still concerned about exposure?If you are not identified as a close contact (and are fully vaccinated), you are welcome to follow the same guidelines as other vaccinated close contacts on our campus - mask-wearing indoors and in crowded outdoor settings, avoid eating with others, physical distancing, self-monitoring for symptoms, and testing 3-5 days after exposure. Most health insurance pays for COVID testing and there are many places that offer COVID testing. Once a negative COVID test is received, the above can be discontinued (except indoor masking for now, of course).
I have some more questions about Muhlenberg policy. Who do I contact?Please reach out to Human Resources at 484-664-3165 or hr@muhlenberg.edu.

          COVID-19 Hosting Campus Events Policy
  








Hosting Events on Campus - Spring 2022
For the safety of our campus community and all guests and audience members on the Muhlenberg campus, the following requirements are currently in place.
Event Categories:
Closed Events - Closed Events are events that take place on campus, sponsored by College departments or recognized student organizations, whose intended audience is limited to students, faculty and/or staff. Students should carry their student IDs at all times while on campus, and IDs must be presented when requested by a College official.
Open Events - Open Events are events that take place on campus and are sponsored by College departments, recognized student organizations or external programming managed through Conference & Event Services, whose intended audience includes guests of the College or the general public. These events may include general admission, open to the public, ticketed programs or by invitation only. The following Open Event types should plan to manage audience access using the following processes:

Performance Events - These events will follow the Department of Theatre and Danceâs typical ticketing procedures when necessary. Performers and lecturers should be positioned at least 12 feet from audience members throughout the performance.
Meals with guests- Holding a meal on campus with invited guests is permitted. Event planners may also work with Seegers Union staff to determine what spaces on campus will comfortably meet their needs.


Catering Guidelines
Red Door Catering and Muhlenberg Dining continue to operate with staff shortages as well as supply chain challenges, with our team working long shifts with limited days off.We continue to ask the campus to allow for a minimum of ten business days for catered events to enable us to plan effectively and ensure that we can accommodate all requests at the highest level of service. Unfortunately, failure to provide ample notice may impact menu, service style or even our ability to support a catered program on campus.As we look at the Collegeâs calendar of signature events planned for the remainder of the spring, we would like to make you aware that during the following dates we may need to modify catering services. As a result, we encourage you to consider limited catering support or select alternate dates if possible:

April 6 - April 9: Through the Red Doors Programming
April 28 - April 30: Board of Trustees, Explore Muhlenberg and Scholarship Luncheon

Red Door Catering will make every effort to support special events; however your assistance in navigating these dates will enable us to fully support College signature events with the highest level of service and attention.

 
Event Sponsors Responsibilities

Event sponsors should continue to monitor College policy as their event approaches.  Modifications to processes, access and capacities could change unexpectedly throughout the semester and we will need to plan accordingly. All other College processes, policy and protocols remain in effect when scheduling events on campus.
Event sponsors need to determine if a pre-registration mechanism will be used. 

*Masking and other restrictions are subject to change in accordance with CDC recommendations, state requirements, and College policy.
*Should we see a change in conditions, the College reserves the right to require pre-event testing and/or proof of vaccination.
*We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we continue to work through an active semester while keeping our community safe.






          Muhlenberg College COVID-19 Masking Policy
  








The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its guidelines for mask-wearing and introduced the COVID-19 Community Levels tool to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs.
Visitors are required to adhere to the same policies in place for campus community members. 
The College expects there are individuals who will continue to wear masks either by choice or out of necessity. We also expect that all community members will be respectful of one anotherâs decisions about wearing a mask. Our COVID policy requires all individuals to adhere to the discretion of faculty, staff or students within their own classroom and office spaces, activities and events.  Failure to do so is a violation of our COVID policy and will be addressed when reported to the Dean of Students Office or Human Resources. 
In support of our immunocompromised community members, the College will provide antigen tests and KN95 masks to these individuals for the remainder of the semester. KN95 masks are recommended by the College for those who wish to protect themselves to the fullest extent.






          Caring for a Dependent Who Is in Isolation Due to Testing Positive for COVID
  








For helpful information on caring for a family member, please review the CDCâs Caring for Someone Sick at Home. 
For faculty who have a personal dependent who is required to isolate or quarantine and requires your care during that period of time, you should notify your department chair of the need to move your class online temporarily or work with them on other individual arrangements.
For staff who have a personal dependent who is required to isolate or quarantine and requires care, staff should notify their supervisor and determine if it is possible for them to complete their work remotely and/or to determine a plan to ensure coverage of office/department needs for the duration of their required isolation/quarantine period. 
If staff are not able to work remotely, they may use time from their sick leave bank. If sick leave has been exhausted, they may request an advancement of up to 10 additional days by contacting Human Resources. Absences for those not eligible for paid sick leave will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This is a temporary expansion to the policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and will end on June 30, 2022, for non-exempt staff and August 31, 2022, for exempt employees, absent further extensions. The original sick leave policy may only be used for the employeeâs own illness or injury.
If you have questions or  concerns about this guidance, please contact:
Laura Furge, Provost
Jill Walsh, Vice President for Human Resources









As a reminder, all students are expected to adhere to the Muhlenberg College COVID Policy 2021-2022.

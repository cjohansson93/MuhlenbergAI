tallied, both finished in third place - an improvement of two spots from last year on both sides.

The women scored 76.5 points to win a three-way tussle for third, with fifth-place Dickinson only two points back. The men ended 
with 117 points, well ahead of fourth-place Gettysburg with 104. Haverford won both championships.

After winning one gold medal on Friday and one on Saturday, the Mules added three more on Sunday. Junior Alex Faust won her second gold medal of the meet, capturing the 400 meters with an NCAA provisional time of 56.83 to break her own school record for the second straight day.

Junior Brendan Kirk contributed to both first-place finishes for the men's team. He won the 400 hurdles for the second time in three years and ran the leadoff leg of the 4x100 relay team - the first sprint relay team to win a gold medal at a conference meet in the history of the men's program.

Two of Kirk's relay teammates also enjoyed success in open events. Junior Jeremiah Lachaud captured silver medals in the 100 and 200, and freshman Peter Rice took bronze in the 400 to go along with a fourth-place finish in the 200.

Two members of the gold-medal 4x800 relay, senior David Chorney (1,500) and sophomore Bobby Torphy (800), added silvers on Sunday. Freshman Marc Brookland earned a bronze medal in the triple jump, breaking a 32-year-old school record.

Faust added two silvers to her two golds, running anchor on the 4x100 and the lead leg on the 4x400. Freshman Jenna Schaffer, who also ran on both relay teams, added another silver medal in the 100 meters.

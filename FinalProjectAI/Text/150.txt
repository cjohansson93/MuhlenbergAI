Teaching Interests
My teaching interests are business ethics, integrated marketing communications, digital marketing, and marketing research and analytics.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research interests are business ethics, digital marketing, humor, and advertising. Recently, I examined how normative ethics perspectives affect moral disengagement and ethics behavioral intentions. In other words, can how one views a situation, in an ethics context, change their behavior intentions.

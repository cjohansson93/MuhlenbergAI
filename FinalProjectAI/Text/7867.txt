Volleyball Streak Ends with Four-Set Loss to Haverford
 Thursday, October 16, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg volleyball team had its school-record 13-match winning streak snapped with a 3-1 loss to Haverford in
a matchup of undefeated Centennial Conference teams.

The Mules (20-3, 6-1), who also suffered their first home loss of the season, fell into third place but are still in
strong position for a playoff berth with three CC matches remaining. Haverford (16-7, 6-0) moved into a virtual tie
for first with Swarthmore, Muhlenberg’s opponent next Wednesday.

After falling 25-21 in a first set they never led, the Mules jumped out to a 9-3 lead in the second set, only to
have the Fords come back to take a 17-14 advantage. Behind the serving of senior Nikki Dickson,
Muhlenberg reeled off the next eight points en route to evening the match with a 25-20 win.

The third set followed a similar script to the first, with Haverford winning, 25-16. The fourth set was tied 21-21 before
Haverford scored the final four points to finish off the match.

Sophomore Allison Glass led the Mules with 11 kills, while junior Katherine Boll
had nine and juniors Erin Murphy and  Sarah Weyhmuller (right, getting a set from Vanessa Pulice)
added eight apiece.

Junior Chelsea Kaser led the defense, which held the CC leader in kills and hitting percentage to 
11 kills and an .031 percentage, with 22 digs.

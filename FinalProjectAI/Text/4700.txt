lynch climbs list in last chance meet



With one member of the Muhlenberg womens track and field team already guaranteed a spot in the NCAA Championships field, another improved her chances at the TCNJ Last Chance Meet.

Senior Jennifer Lynch won the 1,500 meters in 4:33.30, breaking the school record by almost two full seconds and improving on her previous NCAA provisional-qualifying mark of 4:36.98. On the Division III performance list entering the day, 17 runners had posted a better time, but some of them may not run the 1,500 in the national meet. Last year, the runner ranked 29th on the final performance list was invited to the NCAA meet.

Bids for the 2010 championships in Cleveland will be announced on Sunday.

Senior Alex Faust, who has qualified automatically, won the pole vault at TCNJ with a height of 12-4. Her season best of 12-8¾ was sixth on the Division III performance list coming into the meet.

The Mules sent five other athletes to the meet. Senior Jayne Condon (left) broke the school record in the steeplechase by more than 13 seconds, coming in fourth with a time of 11:33.59. The record she broke was set in 2004 by Karen Mount, who was also knocked out the record book by Lynchs performance in the 1,500.

Sophomore Marc Brookland (44-11½) and junior Bobby Torphy (1:53.47) placed fourth and seventh in the triple jump and 800, respectively, and sophomores Kimberlee Yalango (800) and Peter Rice (400) also competed.

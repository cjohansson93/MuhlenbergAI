field hockey re-re-re-runs “the late show”



It’s nice for freshman goalie Kristen Dornenburg of the Muhlenberg field hockey team to know that even if she lets one in early, her teammates will be there at the end. They always are. Literally.

The Mules (6-2, 2-0) played yet another in an improbable series 



Smith’s assist was her first of the season and the third of her career.



of down-to-the-wire games, defeating Haverford 2-1 on a goal by junior Jess Kasza on a penalty corner with 53 seconds remaining.

Here’s the rundown of the heart-stopping finishes: three games decided in overtime, four others (all Muhlenberg wins) decided with 3:12, 1:11, 2:06 and now 53 seconds left in regulation.

The late dramatics have lifted the Mules to their best start since the 2003 team won its first eight. Muhlenberg’s two Centennial Conference wins have come on the road against teams it lost to at home last year.

“It’s definitely a little nerve racking,” said Dornenburg, who in fact did let one in early. The Fords (3-4, 1-2), coming off a game in which they outshot nationally ranked Gettysburg 14-5 but lost, scored on a breakaway just 6:31 into the game.

“That was a downer, but it gives you more incentive to redeem yourself,” said Dornenburg, who has allowed only three goals in the last six games. “The second half was definitely better than the first.”

Both teams had goals disallowed later in the first half, and Muhlenberg did a better job of playing at its tempo at the start of the second half than it did at the outset of the game. The Mules finally broke through and scored the tying goal on a penalty corner with 11:39 to play when senior Tara Cohn converted a pass from stopper Shelby Smith.

“When we know we need to get a goal, we start working together,” commented Dornenburg, a Haverford native who played in front of a good number of family and friends.

Dornenburg made one of her four saves less than three minutes later to keep the score tied. The winning goal came on Muhlenberg’s ninth penalty corner of the game, with Kasza – who netted the winner with 1:11 left in the Mules’ first CC win at Washington – blasting in senior Kristen Sabia’s insertion.

“We’re absolutely ecstatic,” said Dornenburg. “There’s a really bright feeling on this team.”

The Muhlenberg volleyball team did not enjoy nearly the same success at Haverford, falling in three sets in its first match since returning from Texas. When the teams met earlier this season in the 
Buttermaker Tournament, the Mules (4-9, 0-2) captured the first set. This time, the 22nd-ranked Fords took the opening set 25-16 and breezed from there.

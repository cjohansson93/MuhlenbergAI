men’s tennis squeaks past moravian





Apostolos has won matches at No. 2, No. 3, No. 4 and No. 6 singles this year.


For Muhlenberg, the encounters against local rival Moravian always add a pinch of spice no matter which sport is contested. Tonight’s men’s tennis match was not an exception.

After each school had won four matches, 
there was still one sizzling contest which wasn’t finished and had to decide who would be the winner. 

Moravian’s sophomore Jason Bonilla had won the first set, 6-3, against Muhlenberg’s junior Brian Wernick at No. 2 singles, before Wernick 
snatched a dramatic second set, 7-6, winning 7-5 in the tiebreak. 

Wernick opened up a 5-1 cushion in the decisive third set and had a double match point when Bonilla stepped awkwardly, spraining his ankle. 
Unable to continue, Bonilla was helped off the court as the Mules claimed a 5-4 triumph in their opening home match of the season. 

Sophomore Mark Apostolos and freshman Wayne Mitchel contributed two wins each for the Mules, who extended their winning streak against non-conference opposition
to seven.

Apostolos came out victorious at No. 4 singles (6-1, 6-3) after winning his No. 2 doubles match in partnership with John Osborne (8-4). 

Mitchel didn’t allow a single game in his No. 6 singles encounter and posted an 8-2 victory at No. 3 doubles along with senior Jamie Goldman. 

Thanks to the victory against the Greyhounds, Muhlenberg broke the 6-6 tie for the 2007-08 Matte Award with five sports remaining on the spring schedule.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team paid tribute to seniors Amanda DiMarco, Jess Kasza, Chessie Martinez and Cristina Steglitz (left to right

All four were in the starting lineup, but Franklin & Marshall spoiled the festivities by scoring four goals in a 10-minute span of the first half and went on to win, 4-0.

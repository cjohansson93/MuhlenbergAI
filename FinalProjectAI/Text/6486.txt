Antonini Reaches Milestone in Men's Soccer Win
 Wednesday, October 10, 2012 - page 2







					 




The 1-0 display on the scoreboard was almost a mirror image of the milestone that had just been reached by senior Cody Antonini.

Antonini’s goal in the 22nd minute, which stood up as the only score in Muhlenberg’s men’s soccer win against Drew, gave him 100 career points. He is the sixth player in school history to reach the century mark, and he is just eight points away from fifth place on the Mules’ all-time list. Only 13 other players in the Centennial Conference have tallied 100 points. 

It was also his 10th goal of the season, making it his third season scoring 10 or more goals. He is just the fourth player in Muhlenberg history to have achieved this milestone.




Junior back Jonathan Schauer wins a header early in the first half.



“I didn’t know it coming in, but I heard it when they announced it, and it put a smile on my face. It felt pretty good,” smiled Antonini.

In a physical, hard-fought game, Muhlenberg blanked visiting Drew (8-3-2), avenging last year’s shutout loss. It was the Mules’ fifth consecutive one-goal game.

Antonini’s goal came as a header following a long free kick by junior Bucky Aronoff. The assist was Aronoff’s first career point as a Mule. After being fouled in the backfield, he launched a perfectly weighted ball to Antonini, who was waiting on the right side of the box. Antonini’s header sailed over the goalie’s right shoulder and into the net.

Antonini nearly added two more goals to his total, and a substantial cushion to the Muhlenberg lead, in the second half. After classmate Kyle Plifka was fouled in the box, Antonini took the penalty kick and fired a hard strike, which the goalie managed to block away.

Not long after, senior Danny Way angled a pass right to the feet of Antonini as he was streaking from the left wing to the corner of the six. The timing was just a second off, however, and Anontini was unable to get the shot off.

“I missed two easy ones. I probably should have had a PK and another one right inside the box,” stated Antonini. “It’s definitely disappointing because you could put your team in a better spot to win the game, but you still have to fight and work hard. A one-goal lead is tough to hold, so we were just trying to work it up the field and trying to get another one to get further ahead.”


Although they never got a second goal, the Mule defense prevented the Rangers from taking a second-half shot until the 88th minute. Muhlenberg (8-3) held a 10-4 shot advantage over Drew, and allowed just three corner kicks, all of which came in the first half.



Volleyball Swept at F&M

 The Muhlenberg volleyball team had its four-match winning streak snapped by Franklin & Marshall.  The Centennial Conference co-leader swept the Mules, 25-17, 25-20, 25-10.

Junior goalie Jas Chojnowski recorded the shutout for the Mules, his fourth of the season.

Two yellow cards were given out in the physical contest, one to Muhlenberg and one to Drew. The foul count reached 34, with 19 called against the Rangers. 

“All the fouls might get in our players’ heads so, as teammates, we try to keep them cool and just fight back,” said Antonini. “They’re a tough team. They’re really physical so you have to move it around really fast and get around them,”

The Mules can now claim a defeat over the No. 10 team in the Mid-Atlantic Region as they head into the second half of CC play this weekend.

“It’s a regional game so it’s a big game for us,” added Antonini. “We’re trying to play hard every game.”

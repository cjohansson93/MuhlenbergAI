The Mules rebounded from a sweep at the hands of nationally ranked Eastern with sweeps of Emmanuel and Widener sandwiched around a five-set defeat of host Rowan. Sophomore Shannon Hubert and freshman Maggie Enestvedt were named to the all-tournament team.
Keckler, in her seventh season with the Mules, has a career record of 100-80, including an 84-41 (.672) mark since 2012. She spent five years at Gettysburg before coming to Muhlenberg and has a combined record of 196-135.

Volunteering keeps you actively engaged with alma mater, with other alumni and with current students. Remaining involved after graduation helps you to build a large network of peers and, in turn, you can welcome current students into that network.
Some meaningful opportunities include:

Sharing your expertise in the classroom or as a presenter
Maintaining and creating friendships with other alums at events
Serving current students on campus and off as compassionate leaders
Career support for all alumni and student mentoring
Engaging through lifelong learning programs

For more information or to become involved, contact Diana Tirendi at dianatirendi@muhlenberg.edu.

Teaching Interests
My primary teaching responsibilities in the English department are a regularly scheduled intermediate course on Shakespeare and Shakespeare reproduced, an advanced course that focuses on modern filmic and theatrical appropriations of Shakespeare's plays. Every three to four years, I teach Renaissance plays in process, a course that focuses on only a few plays by contemporaries of Shakespeare (like Ben Jonson) and mixes intensive reading and research with applied work in acting, directing, dramaturgy and design. I teach a  Medieval literature course every third year or so that focuses on Old French chivalric romances, Danteâs Inferno, and Middle English texts like Chaucerâs Canterbury Tales and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in addition to more irregularly scheduled courses on James Joyceâs Ulysses, the fictions of J.M. Coetzee, and a senior seminar, The Work of Fiction in an Age of Terror. My film studies teaching concentrates on international and regional cinemas, broadly in my 200-level contemporary world cinema course, more narrowly in the advanced courses on new Asian cinemas, the cinema of new Europe, and the film cultures of North Africa and the Middle-East, which I teach on a rotating basis.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy most recent research project--Reenacting Shakespeare in the Shakespeare Aftermath: the Intermedial Turn & Turn to Embodiment-- concentrates on the development of experimental approaches to the staging, adaptation and appropriation of Shakespeareâs plays in the 20th century and beyond. It particularly seeks to bring some of the more daring postmillennial developments in Shakespeare performance and productionâthe Wooster Group Hamlet, Ivo van Hoveâs Roman Tragedies, Punchdrunkâs Sleep No Moreâto the attention of students, scholars and theater professionals whose experience of performed Shakespeare is largely confined to the comparatively conventional production practices of regional theater companies and more Shakespeare-centric institutions like the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a Shakespeare played âstraight.â 
When I can, I also keep hacking away at an older, considerably larger project that is rooted in research and writing I began doing in the early 1990s on how disorder was dramatically produced in Shakespeareâs Henry VI plays. This project has evolved into a broader study of how some of the same discursive formations I found at work in Shakespeare were deployed by differently situated writers to stigmatize as embodiments of misrule or disorder everyone from insurgent Irishmen to Native Americans to May-pole and Morris dancers to our own so-called Puritan fathers and mothers.

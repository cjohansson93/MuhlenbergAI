Field Hockey Topples No. 3 Montclair State

It took just two games for the Muhlenberg field hockey team to put up a landmark win. The Mules scored three times on the third-ranked team in the country and beat Montclair State 3-1 in resilient fashion. 

“[This win] means we have great potential for this season, ” said senior forward Lauren Jordan, who scored the Mules’ first two goals of the game. “We know that we are a good team and that we are going to do good things this season. ”

Muhlenberg is now responsible for two of Montclair State’s eight losses in the last four years. The 2-1 win over the Red Hawks in 2012 was the last time the Mules beat a top-10 team. Montclair State would go on to win its next 20 games and reach the NCAA championship game. 

This is now the third straight season Muhlenberg has toppled at top-15 team. The Mules knocked off 15th-ranked Ursinus, 3-2, last year.

Jordan’s first goal, assisted by sophomore Rachel Strow (corrected 9/4),  came in just the seventh minute of the game, setting the tone early against one of the top programs in the country.  It looked like the momentum was lost when less than six minutes later the Red Hawks evened the score on a penalty stroke. But only five minutes came off the board when Jordan found her way into the right place at the right time and quickly put the Mules back in front with her second goal of the game, coming off of an assist by senior Samantha Swire

The next 50 minutes featured an impressive display of defending corners. Montclair State had 14 total corners, but only a handful resulted in shots, as senior backs Heather Porrini and Ray Gallagher and sophomore Claudia Theriault led a team effort to keep the tally in their favor. The shots that did get through were calmly turned away by senior goalie Sierra Lenker, who posted five saves on the night. A green card in the 58th minute had the Mules a player down, but the defense held up strong despite the seemingly continuous array of corners.

When it seemed like the lead was really becoming vulnerable, sophomore Emily Boyle sprung into action and sealed the deal with her first goal of the season, with Swire assisting again.

Championship Preview

track and field teams hope to have a day to remember


For Muhlenberg senior sprinter Jeremiah Lachaud, the schedule change in the Centennial Conference Indoor Track and Field Championships might add 30 seconds to his day. 

But for middle-distance and distance runners, the impact in time will be much greater.

The Mule teams will travel to Haverford tomorrow for the CC Championships. As part of a series of cost-containment measures enacted by the CC last year, the meet is one day rather than two. The first event is scheduled for 11:00 and the last for 8:20.

How athletes respond to competing multiple times in the same day and the

long day at the track, and how coaches decide to deploy their athletes, will go a long way to determining how successful each team is.

“I don’t think it is really going to affect me,” said Lachaud, who ranks fourth on the CC performance list in the 55 meters. He also is scheduled to run in the 200 and 4x200 relay. In past years, the 55 trials and 4x200 were on the first day, with the 55 finals and open 200 on the second. Lachaud could potentially run all four on the same day, including the 55 trials and 4x200 back-to-back.

Compare that to the distance runners, who will have to compete in the 3,000 and the 5,000 on the same day. Previously the two longest races

were split up. And in the middle distances, the 4x800 and 4x400 are now back-to-back, instead of being the first and last events on the second day.

“I think having the meet one day is going to put a lot more focus on 
individual events,” said sophomore Kimberlee Yalango, who ran in both relays last year but can only do the 4x800 this time. “Since the meet is only one day, we are going to have to get really focused and determined right before our events. We have fewer opportunities to make things happen so when it’s time to run, it’s time to run.”

Both Muhlenberg teams appear ready to run and match, if not improve, their CC finishes from 2009 (third for the women, fourth for the men). Of the 17 events, the women have an athlete who ranks in the top 10 in all but one, and the men in all but two.

“We have to believe, and not only believing in yourself, but also believing in the team because everyone can score and contribute,” said Lachaud. “We have depth now so we all just need to believe that we can be successful.”

Lachaud will look to have more success in the 55, an event in which he’s placed the last three years, including a silver-medal performance in 2009. “I’m always going for first and I would love to medal again,” he said. “It’s my last year so I want to go out with a bang.”

The men had the top performance in the regular season in two events, the 400 and 4x200, and sophomore Peter Rice was part of both. He also is seeded third in the 200 and could run in the 4x400. Junior Bobby Torphy ranks third on the CC performance list in the 800 and fourth in the mile. He also will run on the 4x800, which has taken gold at the CC meet the last four years.

Senior Brendan Kirk (third in the 55 hurdles and a member of the 4x200 and 4x400 teams) also will have a busy day on the track. Record-setting sophomore Marc Brookland is seeded second in both the long jump and triple jump.

The women will lean heavily on their two returning NCAA qualifiers, seniors Alex Faust and Jennifer Lynch. Faust has won CC indoor gold in the pole vault three times and the 400 twice. She has the top performance this year in both events as well as the 200, and she’s also slated to run in the 4x400. Lynch ranks in the top three in the 800, mile and 3,000 and is scheduled to compete in all three – in a span of about four hours – tomorrow.

Faust’s younger sister, freshman Colette Faust, tops the performance list in the high jump. Freshman Tara Keegan is in the top 10 in the long and triple jumps, and freshman Amanda Brennan in the long jump and 55 hurdles.

The Mule are poised to extend their streak of placing in the top five in the CC indoor meet for seven straight years. “I think we all should not set any limits and give it everything we have,” said Yalango, who sits sixth on the CC performance list in the 800.
“We all need to do everything we can to help the team. We can’t let anything get us down.”

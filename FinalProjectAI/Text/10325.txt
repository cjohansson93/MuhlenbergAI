About the Institute for Religious and Cultural Understanding
The Institute for Religious and Cultural Understanding works to cultivate awareness of religious and cultural diversity locally, domestically and internationally. The educational and research goals of the Institute serve two complementary objectives: to enhance religious and cultural literacy and to support reasoned analysis of religion in public discourse. The Institute reaches beyond the borders of the Muhlenberg campus to effect change in the local community and beyond through the cultivation of both a physical and virtual presence.
Professor of Religion Studies William "Chip" Gruen serves as the Institute's director.
The Institute recently launched the ReligionWise podcast. The most recent episode, "Belief, Identity and Conspiracy," features Muhlenberg Associate Professor of Religion Studies Dustin Nash. Download and listen via your favorite podcast app or listen on the Institute's website.

Men’s Golf Finishes Sixth


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished sixth out of 12 teams at the Tom Kinder Memorial, hosted by Bridgewater.

Competing in a field in which the other schools were all from Virginia or Maryland, the Mules shot a 624 over the two rounds, four strokes better than they did at the same tournament last year. Muhlenberg was just one stroke behind fifth-place Bluefield.

Sophomore Zachary Oyer tied for 10th with a 7-over-par 151. His second-round score of 75 was topped by only six golfers in the field of 60.

Senior Geoffrey Kelleman also shot a 75 on the second day after carding a 79 on the first 18 holes.

If the first tournament of the year is any indication, there will be no sophomore jinx for four members of the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team.

Three of the second-year players won a bracket at the F&M Fall Invitational, and the fourth reached a final.

The team of Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt (left) picked up right where they left off as freshmen, winning the doubles title. The duo, which went 15-4 last year, dropped only four games in its three matches.

Winston and Schmidt were put in the unusual position of playing their teammates in the final. Sophomore Sara Sutker and senior Madeleine Goldfarb, playing together for the first time, won their semifinal match against a Gettysburg team in a tiebreak.

The fourth sophomore, Caitie Druker, stormed back after losing her first match to win the consolation bracket with three straight 8-0 triumphs.

Senior Jenn Powell lost her semifinal match to the eventual women’s singles champion.

For the Mule men, the freshman team of Jordan Rutt and Zach Adler made a nice run through the doubles draw. In their first match, they took a strong Johns Hopkins
duo that wound up winning the championship to a tiebreak before losing, 7-4. Rutt and Adler then won two consolation matches before falling in another close match in the
consolation final.

Sophomore John Osborne won his first singles match before falling in the second round.

Rare Goalie Assist Caps Men's Soccer Scoring Outburst
 Wednesday, September 3, 2014 - page 2







					 




The midfielders and backs were doing such a good job of keeping the ball away from him that senior goalie Danny Pinto didn’t have much work to do in the second half of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s home game against Wilkes. So he found a different way to etch his name on the stat sheet.


With about a minute left, after an offside call against the Colonels, Pinto booted a free kick all the way to the top of the box on the other side of the field. Freshman Anthony Carracino settled the ball and fired a left-shooted shot inside the far post, putting the finishing touches on the Mules’ 4-0 win.

The assist was the first by a Muhlenberg ’keeper since All-American Jason Daniels had two in a 2010 game against Moravian. And it wasn’t the only oddity of the night.

 The four goals matched the most scored by the Mules in a game all last season. All four scores came in the second half – the first time they won 4-0 after being scoreless at the half since 2010, also against Wilkes. 

Despite controlling the play for much of the game, Muhlenberg, ranked sixth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, did not break the ice until senior Lance Dotzman converted an endline cross from sophomore Phil Rahling in the 67th minute. 

That opened the floodgates, and the Mules got a little bit of luck too. About a minute later, Pinto’s long kick went off the head of a Wilkes back to give Muhlenberg a throwin near the corner. Senior Joe Adams’ long throw bounced in the box and was headed into the goal by a Wilkes player.

Adams (left) also helped set up the third goal with a pass in the 77th minute to senior Travis Wantchekon, who dribbled across the field and fired in his fourth career goal.

The Mules had a 20-4 advantage in shots, including a 14-1 margin in the second half. Pinto made one save (matching his assist total) to notch his third career shutout.

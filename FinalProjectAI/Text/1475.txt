President Harring is pleased to continue offering Office Hours for faculty, staff, and students throughout the academic year. These appointments are set aside for you to speak with the President about whatever is on your mind - pitch an idea, voice a concern, ask for advice or share your thoughts on a particular program or initiative at the College.
Members of the campus community may sign up for one of the 15-minute time slots offered by using the links below. Though there is only room for one person's name per time slot, up to three individuals can accompany the person signing up.
President Harring asks that meeting topics be shared in advance by sending an email to president@muhlenberg.edu.  In your email, be sure to include the date and time of your appointment, along with the topic you wish to discuss and the names of any additional individuals joining you.  For ease in gathering the information, please use "Office Hours" in the subject line of your email.
Office hours will continue monthly through April 2018 and will also be advertised by email.  You may call the President's Office to schedule a separate meeting if your topic requires more than 15 minutes.

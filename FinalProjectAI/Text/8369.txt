Three Muhlenberg athletes were selected as the Centennial Conference athlete of the week in their respective sports: Leanna Tallamy in women's basketball, Ian Gimbar in wrestling and Gwen Remaley in indoor field.Tallamy averaged 22.3 points and 12.0 rebounds in a 3-0 week for the Mules. She shot 57.6 percent from the field and 93.5 percent from the line, scoring 67 points in only 72 minutes of playing time. Tallamy recorded double-doubles in all three games to extend her streak of double-doubles to a school-record nine.Gimbar recorded two pins, both in the first period, to clinch wins for Muhlenberg in Centennial Conference matches against Washington and Lee and McDaniel. The Mules led W&L 24-18 before Gimbar flattened his foe with a minute left in the first period. They were clinging to a 20-18 lead vs. McDaniel until Gimbar needed just 48 seconds to record a fall. The two pins kept Gimbar undefeated at 6-0. Remaley broke the school record in the shot put in the first attempt of her career at Kutztown's Golden Bear Invitational. She ended up finishing in second place to a Division II conference champion. Remaley's new record throw of 41-8½ is the third-best in Division III by a freshman this year.

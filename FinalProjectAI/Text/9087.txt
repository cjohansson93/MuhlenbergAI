About Dr. Zipf I am a community ecologist studying the integrated impacts of global changes, including climate, habitat, and conservation management, on biological communities. I have worked in forest, field, and salt marsh habitats and would love to chat about any and all ecosystems. I also love birding, paint-by-numbers, and reality TV and would be even happier to chat about those interests!

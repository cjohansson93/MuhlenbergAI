women’s basketball grounds jays


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team defeated Johns Hopkins 69-59, handing the Blue Jays their first loss in five games.

“It seemed like they were getting better after break, going 4-0,” said sophomore Kelly McKeon, who had nine points and four assists tonight. “We knew it was going to be a good game. We feel like everyone’s aiming for us now, that we have a target on our backs, so we knew we needed to win this one.”

There’s a reason 



Boyle’s 18 points pushed her past 1,250 for her career. She also had a team-leading five assists and three steals.



the Mules (10-2, 7-0) are wearing that target: They now have a two-game lead in the Centennial Conference, thanks to Washington’s loss to McDaniel.

Johns Hopkins (5-8, 3-3) had been holding its opponents to 30.0-percent shooting from the field, but Muhlenberg hit 44.6 percent.

It wasn’t just the Blue Jays’ defense that the Mules had to overcome. In its previous four games, Johns Hopkins owned a plus-16.8 rebound margin.

“They get a lot of second-chance points,” said McKeon. “They get a lot of offensive rebounds and we needed to stop that.”

McKeon did her part with eight defensive rebounds and pulled down a total of 10 boards, just one under her season high.

The Mules put up a hot streak at the end of the first half, going in up by eight, their largest margin since 8:14 into the start of the game. 
Muhlenberg’s continued its streak in the second, going on a 23-11 run, leading by 20 with 7:51 remaining.

“We went on these runs when we got hot and it’s just hard to stop us,” said McKeon.

The run included four three-pointers by three players: freshman Alexandra Chili, senior Lauren Boyle and junior Kaitlyn O’Malley.

Hopkins rallied to pull within eight, but Boyle scored 10 of her 18 points in the final five minutes to help the Mules pull off their third consecutive win.

Chili led Muhlenberg with 20 points, including five three-pointers. Boyle led the Mules with five assists. Sophomore Sheila Cook just missed double digits with nine points.

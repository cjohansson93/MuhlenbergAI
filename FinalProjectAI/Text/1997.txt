Our Mission
Our collective work is grounded in concepts of equity and justice, and we recognize the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals who constitute our intertwined communities. We value deep partnership with community organizations/schools and members and envision our work as co-created with multiple constituencies.
With philosophical rooting in concepts of equity and justice, the Office of Community Engagement engages students, employees and local communities through partnerships intended to catalyze personal, institutional, and community change.






Our Goals
The Office of Community Engagement strives to:

Connect Muhlenberg and Allentown communities in meaningful, deep partnerships aimed at creating positive, inclusive change
Facilitate individual understanding of social identities, civic engagement and communities
Enhance our communitiesâ ability and desire to critically analyze, learn, and dialogue about important social justice issues
Work toward dismantling systemic barriers to equitable lived experiences

In their words, Summer 2020



























When it comes to asking questions, my summer internship was a lesson in self-accountability and self-assurance.

I learned the necessity of detailed planning, constantly being aware of my goals, intentions, and priority while learning to adapt everyone’s vision.

I learned to not give into frustration when circumstances change but adapt. I have
opportunities to change the way I do things, maybe for the better.

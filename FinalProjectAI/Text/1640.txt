âBerg Raises Awareness For Darfur, Katrina WithâMule 8â 



On September 18, Muhlenberg College students, along with members of the faculty and administration, held âMule 8,â a four-hour concert and festival held on the Collegeâs front lawn.

The purpose of “Mule 8” was to raise awareness and funds for the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan and for the destruction in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. With incredible attendance and $1,541.35 raised to be split between the two causes, the event was wildly successful.
In addition to proceeds from “Mule 8,” the College community continues to focus on relief efforts for victims of Hurricane Katrina. Fliers have been posted across campus and large donation receptacles are present at various fairs on campus. There are also donation buckets at Java Joes, the bookstore, the admissions desk in Hass and at the welcome desk in the community service office. All proceeds from the entire campus will go directly to the American Red Cross. Currently, campus-wide donations to help victims of Hurricane Katrina are nearing $2,500.
Students, faculty and staff flocked to the front lawn to support “Mule 8,” which featured some of the College’s top student musical ensembles and bands, including the Muhlenberg Dynamics, the Girls Next Door, Lusitania, Christ Power Activate and Indigo Sun. Carnival rides were set up for all to enjoy, and dinner was brought outside, courtesy of Sodexho dining services.
Much of the day’s anticipation focused on the raffle drawings. A week prior to the event and throughout the day, tickets were sold for chances to win two coveted prizes: a dinner for two in the Haas bell tower and first place in next housing lottery. Student volunteers also sold green DARFUR wristbands (reminiscent of the popular yellow LIVESTRONG wristbands that raise awareness for cancer research).
Though the event was effective, the College’s efforts to shed light on the Darfur situation did not end with “Mule 8.” While students were still buzzing from the festivities of the concert, Muhlenberg welcomed back alumnus Andy Kent ’01, who is working towards a masters degree in public health from Columbia University and who recently returned from the Darfur region where he was worked with International Medical Corps, The discussion was held on Wednesday, September 21, at 7 p.m. in the Lithgow Auditorium, coinciding with the Darfur: National Day of Action.
Muhlenberg College prides itself on being civic-minded and has a history of coming together to raise awareness and money for national and international crises. The College also launched efforts to aid victims of previous disasters, such as September 11 and last year’s tsunami in Thailand.

Men’s Lacrosse Doubled Up by Scranton


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team could not overcome a slow start and lost at home to Scranton, 12-6.

The Mules (1-3) took only nine shots in the first half and trailed 6-1 at the break. They began to make a run when freshman Ty Weisberg took advantage of a Royal mistake on a clear, picking up a pass that had sailed over the head of the Scranton goalie and firing into the wide-open net for his first career goal.

Goals by sophomore Steven Casella and junior Pat Farrell brought Muhlenberg to within 6-4 early in the fourth quarter, but Scranton (1-1) reeled off the next six goals to put the game out of reach.

Junior Connor Winter scored his first career goal late in the fourth, and freshman Brad D’Alessandro recorded the first points of his career with a pair of assists.

Junior Jacob Miller-Sobel and freshman Jesse Deffler of the Muhlenberg men’s indoor track and field team both placed in the pole vault on the first day of the Centennial Conference Championships.

Miller-Sobel cleared 12-5½ to set personal bests for height and placing at a conference meet. His previous best indoor height was 12-0 earlier this season, and in four previous CC meets he finished eighth indoors twice and sixth outdoors once.

Deffler (right), in his first CC meet, cleared 11-11¾ to come in fifth.

The men’s pole vault was one of just a handful of finals on the first day of the meet, and the only one in which Mules placed. The bulk of the meet will take place Sunday, with the running events starting an hour earlier than scheduled due to the approaching snowstorm.

Senior Scott Reutter was in fourth place after the first four events of the heptathlon.

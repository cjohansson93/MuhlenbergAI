kocsis named head wrestling coach


Muhlenberg has hired Mike Kocsis, a former ranked Division I wrestler and one of the top natural bodybuilders in the world, as its new head wrestling coach. 
He replaces Tom Schleicher, who retired in March after 13 seasons at Muhlenberg.

Kocsis is a 1993 graduate of Central Connecticut State, where he was a 


four-year starter and two-time East Coast Conference champion. He qualified for the NCAA Division I 
Championships three times and was ranked as high as 12th in the nation. 

Kocsis also enjoyed a stellar scholastic career for a Phillipsburg High School wrestling team that won four group state titles and was voted the No. 1 team in New 
Jersey three times. He finished his career with a record of 90-11 and was a three-time district champion, placing third in the state meet as a senior.

After graduating college, Kocsis spent one year as an assistant coach at Central Connecticut, one at Franklin (N.J.) High School and three at Phillipsburg High School. 

Since 2000, Kocsis has been owner and director of Unlimited Changes Personal Fitness and Performance Center in Easton, Pa. Among the wrestlers he mentored there are Kellen Russell, a two-time Big Ten champion at the University of Michigan, and Jon Gregory, a 2008 Division III All-American at Ithaca College.

Kocsis has also enjoyed great success as a natural bodybuilder. In his first professional competition, he placed fourth in the 2002 World Natural Bodybuilding Federation Pro Natural Mr. Universe contest, and he finished second the following year. He won the World Natural Sports Organization Mr. Natural USA title and placed in the top six at the world championships three straight years from 2005 to 2007.

A certified personal fitness trainer, Kocsis has had articles published nationally and performs speaking engagements, seminars and camps and clinics for groups all over the country. He was the cover model for FAME Fitness Lifestyle Magazine in February 2007.

Kocsis takes over a Muhlenberg program that has produced a Division III All-American in six of the last nine years.

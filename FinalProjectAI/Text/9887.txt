Elena FitzPatrick SiffordAssistant Professor, Art HistoryArtBaker Center for the Arts484-664-3243elenasifford@muhlenberg.edu
Education
B.A., Art History and African American Studies, Oberlin CollegePh.D., Art History, The City University of New York  
Teaching Interests
My courses include the art history survey as well as courses in the Early Modern period (c. 1500-1800) from a global perspective. This includes courses on the Colonial Americas, Renaissance & Baroque Art and Architecture in Europe, and Pre-Columbian Art. I am affiliate faculty with Africana Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Italian Studies.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy most recent work investigates the depicting of Africans in the visual culture of colonial Mexico and Peru. âMexican Manuscripts and the First Images of Africans in the Americasâ was published in Ethnohistory (Duke University Press, 2019), and âA Fly in Milk: Fear and Black (In)visibility in New Spanish Painting,â was published in Emotions, Art, and Religion in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, c. 1400-1800 (Brill).I have also recently worked with a colleague at Cornell University, Ananda Cohen-Aponte, on several projects addressing issues of diversity and inclusion in the field of art history. We conducted a survey in order to analyze data regarding faculty of color in the professoriate and address ways of widening the pathway in order to diversify the field of Latin American art history.  That resulted in publications entitled âAddressing Diversity and Inclusion in Latin American Art,â Latin American and Latinx Visual Cultures (University of California Press) and âA Call to Actionâ in Art Journal (College Art Association).

Assistant Professor of Computer Science
Trumbower 125484-664-3355 (Phone)
Education
B.A., Austin CollegeM.S., Ph.D., University of North Texas

Background:
I was born in Texas and lived in Texas and Louisiana for the last 30 years. I received my bachelors from Austin College, in Sherman, TX not Austin, TX, and I received my masters and PhD from the University of North Texas. My research was in model validation, specifically the validation of emergency response plans to disease outbreaks.
When I am not teaching I like to bake, brew beer and mead, and play tabletop role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. I am married to my best friend, Dr. Harsha Gwalani, and we have two dogs, Chance and Chewy.

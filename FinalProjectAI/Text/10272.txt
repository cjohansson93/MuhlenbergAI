Francesca Jones â21
Francesca Jones â21, a sustainability studies and psychology double major, first conducted research last fall, while studying abroad in Australia. She worked with a local environmental nonprofit to assess the communityâs attitudes toward the nonprofitâs goals. In the spring, she took the psychology course Research Methods and learned of the opportunity to receive a grant for summer research via the new David C. Rabold Fund for Interdisciplinary Research in Sustainability.
âI just knew that was something I wanted to look into, considering my interest and experience in psychology research and environmental issues,â she says.
This summer, Jones is studying âhow perceived risk of climate change predicts climate change engagement and more specifically, support of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies,â including how that varies across socioeconomic groups in the United States. 
âWhen I was first deciding on a topic, what stuck out to me as something that could be investigated more was specifically Americans and a lack of urgency and perceived risk when it comes to climate change,â Jones says. âWhile many Americans acknowledge itâs an issue and are familiar with what it is, thereâs a great lapse in urgency when compared to other countries.â
With help from Professor of Biology and Director of Sustainability Studies Rich Niesenbaum (her research advisor) and Associate Professor of Psychology Connie Wolfe, Jones designed a survey to try to determine whatâs behind Americansâ lack of urgency. She administered it to 253 respondents across the country using Amazon Mechanical Turk, a platform that allows users to hire other users to do simple tasks. Right now, sheâs analyzing the data. 
The goal is to produce a poster by summerâs end that she can hopefully present in some capacity during her senior year. Once this project is wrapped, Jones will set her sights on producing a senior thesis in psychology related to individualsâ consumption.
âConducting research this summer has been an awesome experience, but most of it is online and thereâs not as much observation and interaction happening as I would like,â she says. âThatâs something I would like to incorporate into my thesis.â

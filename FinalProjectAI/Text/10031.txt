Members of the Russian Club at Muhlenberg College engage in a broad spectrum of extracurricular activities which relate to the study of Russian culture, history, politics, and society. If you're curious about Russia, its cultural heritage, or current developments, you may want to consider joining our club. By becoming a member you will enjoy the opportunity to visit Russian art exhibitions, attend concerts and shows, view and discuss Russian films and TV shows with your peers and faculty, meet knowledgeable guest speakers, taste Russian foods, and much more.
The Russian Club prides itself on giving to the local community and spreading knowledge of Russian culture. This past semester, we raised $100.00 for the American Cancer Society, donated to the Muhlenberg College Relay for Life Event, and sponsored a student from Raub Middle School for an educational trip to Washington DC.
Membership is not exclusive to Russian Studies majors and minors! For more information about the Russian Club, click on the links below.

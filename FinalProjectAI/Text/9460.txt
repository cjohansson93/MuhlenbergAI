The Award for the Outstanding Advisor to First-Year Students was established in 1987 as testimony to the high value the College places on advising for incoming students. The award recipient is chosen by nomination from students in advising groups.
Moore has directed at theatres in New York, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, San Francisco and Ireland and is a founding member of The Proper Villains Theatre Co. His research and performing interests include the avant-garde, ecological theatre and performance theory. He earned his bachelor's from Muhlenberg College and earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University.

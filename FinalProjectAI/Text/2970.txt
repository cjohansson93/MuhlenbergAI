volleyball swept by crusaders




Caitlin Dombkowski (23) and Brooke McQueen (2) jump to block an attack by the Crusaders’ Emily Carson.



Three times the Muhlenberg volleyball dug a big deficit for itself, and three times it fell just short of coming all the way back.

The Mules (8-11) lost 25-23, 25-22, 25-23 to Susquehanna in their final non-conference tune-up of the season on Tuesday night.

Muhlenberg trailed 15-9 in the first set before rattling off five out of the next six points to pull to within two at 16-14. Trailing 21-17, the Mules again went on a big run, this time putting together five straight points to go up 22-21. But the Crusaders (20-11) came back to tie at 23-23 and then take the final two points of the set.

The Mules made an even bigger comeback in the second set, as they trailed 18-10 before winning seven out of eight points to make it 19-17. But Susquehanna clung to a slim lead before eventually taking the set.

A run for five out of six points brought Muhlenberg to down just 19-17 in the third set before it fell behind 24-20. Kills by seniors Brittany Williams and Phylicia Lee sparked a three-point run to make it 24-23, but the Crusaders held on for the victory.

Lee led the Mules with nine kills and three aces. Senior Christina Cangelosi recorded 22 digs, and freshman Bryn Baker added 14.

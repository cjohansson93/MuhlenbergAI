men’s golf wins own invitational



The Muhlenberg men’s golf team wrapped up a highly successful fall season by winning the Muhlenberg Invitational by 11 strokes over Lafayette.

After four consecutive second-place finishes, the Mules won their own tournament for the first time since 2000. Their team score of 311 was the lowest at the Muhlenberg
Invitational since that 2000 team shot a 306.

Sophomore Biff Slocum nearly became the third different Muhlenberg player to win a tournament this fall. His round of 75 was one stroke off the lead. Slocum
shot a tournament-best two-under 33 on the front nine, but had to settle for the third-place plaque since the tiebreaker for second place was lowest score on the back nine.

Junior Geoffrey Kelleman and sophomore Chris Trapp each finished with a 76. Trapp was playing for the Muhlenberg Red team, which tied for fourth out of
14 complete teams.

In six fall tournaments, the Mules finished first twice and second once. The only other year they won two fall tournaments was 2000.

Prospective Students
Admission
Students are admitted into the Art Department through the regular Muhlenberg College admissions process. Students interested in studio art or art history are invited to sit in on a class. Although not required, we suggest that prospective students with a high interest in studio art visit the department and meet with a member of the faculty.
To schedule a class visit and/or a meeting with faculty, please contact Beth Buechler at 484-664-3243 or buechler@muhlenberg.edu.
Art Talent Grants
Prospective students interested in pursuing the visual arts may be considered for a Muhlenberg College Talent Grant ranging from $1000 to $4000. The grant is announced after acceptance to Muhlenberg, and awarded upon matriculation.  Students do not need to be art majors to be considered, but should be seriously interested in art and have plans to continue their study of art in college. 
To apply, please submit approximately 15-20 images in digital form via email attachment or as a link to a website. Images may be sent to Beth Buechler at buechler@muhlenberg.edu.

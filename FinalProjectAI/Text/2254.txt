Established in memory of the life and service of Robert C. Williams, academic vice president and dean of the College from 1985 to 1987, The Robert C. Williams Faculty Award honors a junior faculty member for distinguished scholarship and research or public performance. This year's recipient is Maura Finkelstein, assistant professor of anthropology.
The Muhlenberg College Honors Convocation is a formal academic ceremony designed to honor and celebrate leadership and scholarly excellence and achievement. This year marks the College's 172nd year of higher education and, due to the nationwide impact of COVID-19, the first time the ceremony was conducted virtually.

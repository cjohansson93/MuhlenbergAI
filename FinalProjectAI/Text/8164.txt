In this position, Taub-Pervizpour will be responsible for engaging with faculty, staff and students on numerous digital and technology-based projects. In addition to collaborating with faculty and administrators who work with digital technologies for teaching, curriculum development and research purposes, she will also communicate with faculty, staff and students about developments within the digital teaching and learning sector of higher education.
âLora's excellence in the classroom, on campus and in the community make her an ideal leader for this rapidly emerging area of Muhlenberg's academic program," said Provost John Ramsay.
In addition to teaching several technology-based courses for the media and communication department (including Documentary Research, Documentary Fieldwork, New Information Technologies, and a cluster course, New Media Literacies) Taub-Pervizpour has also conducted long-term ethnographic research on the socio-cultural impacts of digital media in the lives of children and youth.
Furthermore, Taub-Pervizpour works with HYPE, a youth leadership program that allows Allentown teens to collaborate with Muhlenberg students on digital media and documentary production. 
In addition to her current responsibilities, Taub-Pervizpour will represent the College at national conferences such as NITLE and EDUCAUSE, while also creating opportunities for Muhlenberg College to collaborate with the faculty and staff of LVAIC or other consortia.

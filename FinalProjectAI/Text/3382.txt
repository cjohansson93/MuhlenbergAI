baseball sticks with winning strategy


The formula worked so well the last time, the Muhlenberg baseball team didn’t change much.

For the second straight game, the Mules got outstanding

starting pitching, a save from the bullpen and enough clutch hitting to defeat Swarthmore. The 5-1 win completed Muhlenberg’s 13th straight season sweep of the Garnet.

his second win of the season. He pitched into the eighth inning for the first time in his career and struck out four.

Senior Matthew Ordog earned his second consecutive save by recording the final five outs. He struck out the first three batters he faced, then got some help from his defense after giving up a single. Senior Edward Risener caught a line drive at first and made a diving tag of the Swarthmore runner for a game-ending unassisted double play.

The clutch hitting came from several sources. In the third inning, the Mules (8-11-1, 2-0) plated the first run on a double steal by junior Dan Fisher and freshman Jesse Nusbaum. Junior Eric Pomroy singled in Nusbaum, and with two out senior Chris Costa delivered a clutch RBI single to score Pomroy.

Senior John Kalis brought in the first of two big insurance runs in the top of the ninth with his fourth hit of the game, a two-out live-drive single to center. The second run scored on an infield error.

Risener wasn’t the only Muhlenberg player to flash some leather. Senior Eric Hammond made a diving catch in center and threw out a runner trying to stretch a single into a double. Nusbaum made a couple of nice catches in right, and Fisher’s diving stop of a ground ball up the middle resulted in an out. 

Daniels helped himself out by leaping to catch a soft liner over his head in the bottom of the seventh.

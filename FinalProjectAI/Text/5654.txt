BEARS AND BEARS, OH MY!




Wrestling Team Comes in Sixth



The Muhlenberg wrestling team finished sixth at the Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by Ursinus.

The Mules did not crown any individual champions. Their best finishes were seconds by juniors Billy Hall (141) and Justin Fitch (174). Both were defeated in the finals by the top seeds, and Fitch had the misfortune of running up against the two-time CC wrestler of the year.

Hall ended the season with the best record on the team, 27-5.

Junior Matt Horn won the consolation final to finish third for the third consecutive year.

Needing wins on the final day of the regular season to improve their playoff picture, both Muhlenberg basketball teams lost at home to Ursinus by almost identical scores, the men 72-69 and the women 71-69.

The men, who would have clinched a Centennial Conference playoff berth with a win, ended their season. The women, who would have earned the top seed for CC playoffs with a victory, instead must travel to Franklin & Marshall next weekend.

In the men’s game, the Mules (10-15, 8-10) ran out of time as they 



The losses spoiled the final home appearances for five seniors who were honored prior to the games: player Greg Pask (above) and managers Joshua Goldstein and Sareve Lawson for the men’s team and players Michelle Feldman and Abra Like for the women’s team.




were trying to catch up the 17th-ranked Bears.

Trailing 72-65 with 1:40 remaining, Muhlenberg made one final push to come back. A pair of successful free throws and a three-point play by junior Mike Bernardini saw the Mules cut the gap to only three points, 72-69, with 42 seconds left. 

Ursinus ate up 35 seconds of the remaining time, forcing a shot-clock violation, which gave the possession to the Mules, who had only seven seconds to tie the score and keep their playoff hopes alive.

Bernardini released the ball from the corner at the buzzer 
and a collective sigh from the crowd followed as the ball glanced 
off the rim. Muhlenberg’s season had ended, and Ursinus (23-2) had completed an undefeated CC campaign.

Bernardini finished with 27 points for the Mules, who were trailing at halftime, 32-28. The Langhorne, Pa., native scored 23 of his total tally during the second half, including 12 free throws. 

Junior Darrell Roth and sophomore Ryan Foster added 11 points apiece.

Like the men, the women made a stirring comeback and missed a chance to tie the game in the final seconds.

The Mules (19-6, 14-4) played a sloppy first half, making only four of their first 23 shots and turning the ball over 10 times. They trailed by 17 points (28-11) with 5:30 left in the half and still faced a 14-point deficit at the break.

A three-pointer by sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley with 8:56 left completed the comeback, equalizing the score at 49, but Ursinus (13-12, 11-7) quickly built another double-digit lead. 

With her team down by 10 at the two-minute mark, freshman Kelly McKeon nearly brought Muhlenberg back singlehandedly, scoring 11 points in a 73-second blitz that cut the gap to one with 38.3 ticks left.

The Mules took possession down two, 71-69, with 26.8 seconds to play, and missed four potential game-tying shots.

Junior Lauren Boyle led Muhlenberg with 22 points, while McKeon scored 16 of her 18 in the second half.

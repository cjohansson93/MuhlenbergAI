Muhlenberg students, from left: Samantha Tropper â18, Owen Yingling â21, Sophie MacKay â20, Ashley Hiester â20, Rebecca Grabarchuk â21, Hannah Polaski â21, Hannah Betz â21, Ryan Carey â21, Candice Belina â19, Margaret Capone â20 and Laura Santo â20.
Muhlenberg voice students made a stunning showing at the District Auditions of the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) this February at Moravian College. With 12 Muhlenberg students participating, eight walked away as prize winners in their respective divisions. 
Dominating the field, Muhlenberg students swept the entire Freshman/Sophomore Music Aria and Art Song Division, and, winning two out of three possible awards in each, nearly swept Freshman/Sophomore and Junior/Senior Music Theater.
âThis impressive showing is a testament to the great talent and skill of our students as well as the excellent instruction they receive from our music faculty,â says Chris Jackson, director of choral and vocal studies. âThey represented themselves and the department superbly.â 
Placing first in their divisions were Samantha Tropper â18, student of Christa Warda; Candice Belina â19, student of Trisha Budlong; and Margaret Capone â20, student of Megan Durham.
Placing second in their divisions were Laura Santo â20, student of Christa Warda; Sophie MacKay â20 and Katherine Fletcher â18, both students of Ellie Escher.
Placing third in their divisions were Owen Yingling â21, student of Christopher Jackson; and Rebecca Grabarchuk â21, student of Fiona Gillespie Jackson.
Other students who participated in NATS included Hannah Betz â21, Ryan Carey â21, Katherine McGuire â20 and Hannah Polaski â21.

Current Student FAQs











          Do I have to reapply for financial aid every year?
  








Need-based aid is determined on an annual basis. Therefore, students must to reapply every year by our stated deadlines. This ensures that every student receives the financial aid package that best reflects his or her familyâs need.
Students with only Merit Scholarships, Talent Scholarships, Honors Program, or a combination of the three, must only complete the Muhlenberg Scholarship and Aid application. This is to update personal contact information and establish FERPA contacts. Studentsâ continued eligibility for merit awards and honors programs will automatically be determined.






          Will I get the same amount of financial aid every year?
  








Merit based aid, Talent Scholarships, and Honors Program awards remain the same every year as long as you maintain the minimum cumulative GPA required to maintain these scholarships. (For example, for Merit Scholarships: first year students need a 2.5 cumulative by the end of the year and a 3.0 cumulative every year after). Talent Scholarships and Honors Program eligibility is determined by the head of the program.
Need-based financial aid awards are recalculated every year.
Students are eligible for their Federal Direct Student Loan every year upon filing the FAFSA. Freshmen are eligible for a total $5,500 loan, sophomores a total $6,500 loan, and juniors and seniors a total $7,500 loan each year.






          Can I increase my merit aid after I have already been accepted?
  








No, your merit aid is used to shape our incoming Freshman Class. It is calculated from your high school transcript, SAT/ACT scores submitted, and your standing in the admission applicant pool.






          What other forms of aid are there if I did not get as much aid as I expected?
  








Students are always encouraged to research outside scholarships. Outside scholarships awarded to Muhlenberg College students will benefit students to the greatest extent possible. Students are required to report their outside awards to the Office of Financial Aid as soon as they are notified of them. No amount of aid, including outside awards and merit scholarships, can ever exceed Muhlenbergâs cost of attendance. In order to achieve this, the College will first reduce self-help (loans and/or jobs). After that, a dollar for dollar reduction in Muhlenberg College grants and scholarships will occur so that no form of assistance is in excess of a studentâs cost of attendance.
Students may also look into alternative loans in order to finance the rest of their education. We cannot recommend any lenders, however, you may Google âStudent Alternative Loansâ and do research on your own. Once you find a few lenders in which you are interested, we would be more than happy to help answer your questions. The student will need a credit worthy co-signer in order to apply for these loans.
A studentâs parent can look at applying for a Federal Direct PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student) Loan. This loan is taken out in the parentâs name, through the federal government, and is repaid by the parent. The current interest rate is 7.08% and the processing fee is approximately 4.24%. If the parent is denied the PLUS Loan, the student is then eligible for a $4,000 unsubsidized federal student loan (freshmen and sophomores) or a $5,000 loan (juniors and seniors). You may contact the school for more information or visit our loans tab.
 






           Do I have to be a music/theatre/dance/ art/film studies major in order to keep my scholarship?
  








No, you must not be a major in that discipline in order to maintain your talent scholarship. It is asked that you be an active participant in the life of that department or program (i.e.: take a class once a year, participate in a group ensemble, etc).

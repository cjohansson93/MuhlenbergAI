Tennis Teams Fall


Both Muhlenberg tennis teams lost matches to regionally ranked opponents.

Competing without their No. 1 player, the women fell at Wilkes, ranked 12th in the Atlantic South Region, 8-1. The lone point for the Mules came from the team of senior Amanda von Taube and sophomore Danni Yaron at No. 3 doubles.

Muhlenberg (5-4, 5-9) now turns its attention to what amounts to a playoff match in its regular-season finale at home against Dickinson on Saturday. If the Mules win the match, they will earn a Centennial Conference playoff berth as the fifth seed. If they lose, the fifth playoff spot will go to Washington, barring an improbable loss by Franklin & Marshall to Bryn Mawr.

The men were shut out by Franklin & Marshall, the ninth-ranked team in the region, in their home finale. The closest Muhlenberg came to a point was at No. 3 singles, where freshman Derrick Eng went to a third-set supertiebreaker.

The Mules finish up their season at Ursinus on Saturday.

Senior Samantha Mayden of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team shattered the school record in the 5,000 meters at the Penn Relays.

Running in the Olympic Development race, Mayden placed ninth out of 31 runners. The top six finishers were all from running clubs; the only collegiate runners to
beat Mayden were from Divsion I Central Michigan and Division II Mansfield. 

Mayden’s time of 16:47.15 broke the previous mark of 17:13.55 she set last year by more than 26 seconds. It is the third-fastest time in Division III this
season; second-fastest belongs to a Johns Hopkins runner, and until this season to Centennial Conference athlete had run faster than 16:50.

The Invasion of Public Relations on the Internet:
We're Being Exploited and We Don't Even Know It!
History has repeatedly proven that every new technological form of communication is received with two distinct perspectives. There are those with a techno-utopian outlook, who believe the technology is an instrument for unifying people, thought, and accountability for large corporations and the government. Unfortunately, there are those who see the same technology as a means for domination, exploitation, and profit. As technology becomes more sophisticated, so do the ways in which that technology is exploited. This essay exposes the different ways big business use the Internet as a public relations tool-and explores the irony that techno-utopians unwittingly create the upbeat perceptions that, in turn, enable corporate public relations to be effective via the Internet.

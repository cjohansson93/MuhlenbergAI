Muhlenberg will be a host campus for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) program for the first time this summer.
âCTY is pleased to bring our challenging programs for bright students to Muhlenberg College this summer,â said Amy Shelton, interim director and director of research for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. âMuhlenbergâs enthusiasm for CTYâs mission and welcoming, well-appointed campus close to many major cities make it well-suited to host CTY students from around the country and the world.â
A global leader in gifted education, CTY is dedicated to identifying and developing the talents of academically advanced pre-college students around the world. The center serves bright learners and their families through research, advocacy and counseling, as well as through its signature gifted summer, online, and family programs. A nonprofit, CTY awards more than $5 million in financial aid to income-eligible students annually.
Muhlenberg will host students in grades 7 and above over two, three-week sessions from June 23 to July 12 and July 14 to Aug. 2. These sessions include challenging courses in the humanities, writing, math, computer science, economics, and science. Approximately 200 students and 50 staff are expected to attend each session at Muhlenberg.
CTY was founded in 1979 in response to a national need to recognize and develop the academic talents of bright elementary, middle, and high school students. Today, it is accredited for students in grades K-12 by the Middle States Association of College and Schools. There are more than 165,000 CTY alumni around the world, including the founders of Facebook and Google, Regeneron Science Talent Search winners, Rhodes Scholars, and MacArthur Fellows. For more information, visit cty.jhu.edu.

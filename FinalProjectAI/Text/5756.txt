football breaks into top 10


The Muhlenberg football team achieved another landmark in its incredible 2007 season when it moved into the top 10 in the 
American Football Coaches Association poll.

The Centennial Conference champion Mules (9-0), who are tied for 10th with St. Norbert, are in the top 10 for the first time in their Division III history. Only one other men’s team in College
history has been ranked in the top 10 in Division III – men’s soccer, which made numerous appearances in the upper regions of the rankings in the
late 1980s and 1990s, most recently at No. 8 in 1997.

One of nine undefeated teams in Division III and one of 12 to have clinched a bid to the NCAA Tournament, Muhlenberg is ranked 15th in the 
D3football.com poll.

The Mules remain in the top 10 in Division III in several statistical categories. They are second in scoring defense, total defense and pass efficiency defense, trailing only
top-ranked Mt. Union in all three.

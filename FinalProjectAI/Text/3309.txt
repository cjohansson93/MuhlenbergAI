rankings, honors for soccer teams




Both Muhlenberg soccer teams are ranked in the Middle Atlantic Region by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA), and both had newcomers named player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

The Mule women are ranked eighth in the region after defeating St. Joseph’s and Kean in their first two games. Freshman Renee Dessimone (left) scored
four of the eight goals and was named Centennial Conference player of the week. She had a hat trick vs. St. Joseph’s in the first game of her career.

Muhlenberg’s men’s team is seventh in the region following a 3-2 loss to William Paterson – which received votes for the national top 25 – and a 4-0
shutout of Neumann. Sophomore Tom Reilly (right) scored four goals, including three against Neumann for the Mules’ first hat trick in eight years, on only
five shots.

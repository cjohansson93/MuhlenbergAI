The Biology Department at Muhlenberg College is composed of distinguished faculty who are highly engaged in their teaching and research, and students who are equally enthusiastic about studying the diversity of life in a liberal arts environment.  As a department, we value the breadth of our discipline.  At all levels, we engage students in the creative and investigative process of science as they develop critical and analytical skills and an understanding of the methods by which biologists study nature. Many students collaborate with faculty on research that leads to professional presentations and publications, choose to do internships or study abroad. Our students are active in the Muhlenberg community through clubs such as Synapse, Biology Club and Muhlenberg College EMS.

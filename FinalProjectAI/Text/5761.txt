Football Climbs Polls


The undefeated Muhlenberg football team continues to rise is the national and regional polls.

The Mules (8-0) are ranked 12th by the American Football Coaches Association and 16th by D3football.com. Their AFCA standing is the highest in program history and ties the best for any Muhlenberg squad since the field hockey team climbed to No. 7 in 2003. The Mule men’s soccer team was ranked 12th early last season.

Muhlenberg also climbed to No. 3 in the Lambert Poll, behind only Washington & Jefferson and St. John Fisher. 

A loss by Occidental late Saturday night left the Mules as one of 11 undefeated teams in Division III.

On the Division III statistical leaderboard, Muhlenberg is in the top 10 in seven categories. The Mules are second in scoring defense and pass efficiency defense, third in total defense and turnovers lost, seventh in sacks, eighth in rushing defense and 10th in passes had intercepted.

Senior Lauren Rutt was a first-team selection, a year after making the second team. The Mules’ field leader from her central midfield position, Rutt has scored a career-high five goals, including the game-winner in overtime in Friday’s 2-1 victory against No. 19 Gettysburg. Ten of her 13 points came in CC games. 

Senior Nikki Rhoads became the fourth player in Muhlenberg history to earn All-CC honors three times, landing on the second team. She earned second-team honors in 2005 and honorable mention last year. Rhoads leads a defense that ranks fourth in the CC in goals-against average (1.56) and has allowed more than one goal only five times in 18 games. She also has contributed to the offense with a goal and three assists.

Sophomore Nicki Notarianni was a first-time CC honoree, receiving honorable mention. Notarianni is tied for eighth in the CC with a team-leading 11 goals, including six in CC play.

Muhlenberg tied for third in the CC and will face No. 8 Johns Hopkins in a CC semifinal on Saturday at Ursinus.

On Monday, March 21, 2005, Muhlenberg College will host University of Notre Dame professor Luke C. Gibbons for a lecture entitled “Fracturing the Future: Joyce, Contingency, and the Irish Narrative.” Gibbons appears as part of the College’s John D.M. Brown Lecture Series. The lecture will be held in the Lithgow Science Auditorium of Trumbower Hall at 7 p.m. A reception will precede the lecture at 6:30 p.m. in the Trumbower Foyer. Gibbons will also be available for an open conversation in Seegers Union, room 109 at 4:30 p.m.
Luke Gibbons holds the Keough Family Chair in Irish Studies and directs the graduate program in Irish Studies at Notre Dame where he teaches in the Department of English and in the Department of Film, Television, and Theater. In 2003, Cambridge University Press issued Professor Gibbons' most recent book, Edmund Burke and Ireland: Aesthetics, Politics and the Colonial Sublime 1750-1850, hailed in the Irish Times as a bracing read” with “much to say” and, in the New Hibernia Review, as “an exemplary interdisciplinary work in which aesthetics, ideas and history are mutually activating.”
Gibbons has also pioneered the study of Irish cinema, co-authoring (with Kevin Rockett and John Hill) the first scholarly, critical study of Irish film, Cinema and Ireland (1988). His most recent publication is Gaelic Gothic: Race, Colonialism and Irish Culture (2004), and is working at present on a study of romanticism and the Enlightenment in Ireland, as well as a book on James Joyce, modernism and memory.
As one of Ireland's most prominent public intellectuals, Gibbons has served as a contributing editor to The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (1991) and has recently co-edited Reinventing Ireland: Culture, Society and the Global Economy (2002) and The Theatre of Irish Cinema (2002). Gibbons also serves on the Board of Trustees of the International James Joyce Foundation and as a consulting editor of Interventions: A Journal of Postcolonial Studies.
The John D.M. Brown Lectureship is supported by a generous gift from the late Mary E. Brown, in loving memory of her husband, Dr. John D. M. Brown (1883-1951). Brown served as a Professor of English at Muhlenberg for 37 years.

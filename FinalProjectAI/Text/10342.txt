Teaching Interests
I teach biology courses at the cellular and molecular level. Courses I have taught include BIO 152 Principles of Biology III: Cells and molecules, BIO 225 Microbiology (lecture and lab), BIO 334 Immunology, BIO 487 CUE: Host-Bacteria Interactions (W). Based on our curriculum, my courses are offered to sophomores, juniors and seniors. My teaching philosophy is to create an environment where students actively engage with the material and think through it. In lectures, I present the material in PowerPoints and/or on the board and I ask students questions to gauge their attention and learning. In labs and recitations I create scenarios where students "teach each other" and discuss the material. This requires mastery and critical thinking of biological processes. Many of my assignments include communication of these biological processes verbally (oral presentations), in writing (papers) and with drawings and diagrams (within papers). The goal of these assignments is to give the students a chance to convey complex biological processes to others. By the time students complete any of my courses, they should be able to understand and communicate complex molecular and biological processes to non-experts.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research focuses on the interactions between commensal and pathogenic bacteria with the human host, mainly in (but not limited to) the oral cavity. These interactions, in healthy individuals, remain at homeostasis. However, alterations may lead to the onset of oral diseases such as periodontal disease. My lab is currently studying interactions between periodontal pathogen Porphyoromonas gingivalis with macrophages. Thus far, our results indicate that P. gingivalis can escape macrophage phagocytosis. We have also been studying the role of oral commensal bacteria in the invasive process of P. gingivalis. Our data suggest that oral commensal bacteria protect host in the context of P. gingivalis infections but the mechanisms remain unknown. 
Another important and novel factor to oral host-bacteria interactions is the aerosol from electronic cigarette devices. To date, there is limited information about the effects of vaping in host-bacteria microenvironments in the mouth. My lab is starting to dissect the role of vaping in commensal and pathogenic bacteria, in the human epithelial tissue and in the host-bacteria interactions. Our data, thus far, show a significant effect of vaping in the growth of oral commensal bacteria and oral epithelial cells. Therefore, vaping may contribute to oral diseases.

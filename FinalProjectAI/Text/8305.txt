When Kaci Gregory â18 was a senior in high school, she was studying three (!) different languages: French, Spanish and Italian.
âI always loved languages,â Gregory says. âBut when I took all three at once, sometimes it could be a little complicated. I'd walk into Spanish class saying âbonjourâ because I would have both classes on the same day.â
When she moved on to college, she narrowed her focus to the one sheâd stuck with the longest: French. What attracted the French & francophone studies and media & communication double major to Muhlenberg was its academic rigor, she says, as well as its athletics programâshe was recruited as a middle-distance track runner. However, the fact that more than 50 percent of Muhlenberg students study abroad during their four years was a nice bonus.
âI told my parents early on in high school that I was going abroad in college,â she says. âAnd the more I learned about the program at Muhlenberg, the more interesting it seemed to me.â
It was so interesting to Gregory that she ended up doing two semesters away from campus through the office of global education: one in France, during the fall semester of her junior year, and one in Washington, D.C., a year later.
At the Institute for American Universities (IAU) in Aix-en-Provence, Gregory stayed with a host family and participated in the honors French immersion program. That meant she took five courses, all taught entirely in French.
âI had great professors,â she says. âOne, Muriel Cros, didn't know really much English at all, but she was just the most passionate French woman I have ever met in my entire life. She loves the French language, and I feel like her enthusiasm made me even more excited about the language and breaking down some of the nuances.â
In D.C., Gregory (pictured at right during a visit to the White House) worked as a marketing and communications intern for the French Academy, which offers French classes and education for students of all ages.
âOne idea of mine that we were able to bring into fruition was a holiday workshop: We had people come during the holidays to do wine-tasting, try different cheeses and learn different French terms,â she says. âIt was an opportunity for people to come together and have a fun evening but also learn French.â
Eileen McEwan, associate professor of French who was a visiting professor at IAU during Gregoryâs semester there, taught Gregory at Muhlenberg and in France. 
âI loved having her in class because she was always engaged, curious and loved to speak French,â she says. âVery frequently she would come into class and tell me about someone she met who she overheard speaking French somewhereâlike during a visit to the MoMA or in a restaurant or on the streetâand how that contact developed into a friendship. Her network is huge due to her warm personality and her eagerness to use her French in every way possible.â
Gregory is currently working at a payroll company in Allentown. Sheâs keeping up her French by tutoring and reading French novels en route to a very specific long-term career goal: to be a brand strategist for a French cosmetics company. The time she spent in France, she says, was critical in helping her develop the conversational language skills sheâd need in such a role.
âOur idea of fluency is something that seems so easy to attain, but we don't realize that there are so many nuances in the languages,â she says. âI learned so much while studying abroad. Iâm so much stronger in my French now.â

men’s basketball downed in 2007 finale


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team lost to DeSales, 60-50,
in the last athletic contest of the calendar year.

The Bulldogs (8-1), who came in 14th in Division III in scoring defense, kept the Mules (5-5) off the scoreboard for the first eight minutes of the game, opening up a 9-0 lead. 

Muhlenberg clawed back to within four points, at 22-18, late in the half, but back-to-back three-pointers — two of only three DeSales made in the game — quickly
put the margin back at 10. The Bulldogs kept the Mules at bay the rest of the way, leading by at least five points most of the second half.

Muhlenberg, which was 33rd out of 382 Division III teams in scoring defense, held an opponent to 65 points or fewer for the seventh time in 10 games. The Mules actually
made more field goals than DeSales (20-19), but the Bulldogs had a big advantage in free throws.

Sophomore Obi Nwizugbo (left) led Muhlenberg with 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Junior Mike Bernardini added 11 points.

This partnership complements the existing articulation agreement between the two institutions and offers a streamlined admissions process for LCCC students interested in furthering their studies at Muhlenberg College.
Signed by LCCC President Dr. Ann D. Bieber and Muhlenberg College President John I. Williams, Jr., the agreements are designed to ease students’ transition from LCCC associate degrees to six Wescoe School bachelor’s degree programs with related curriculums.
“Through our Wescoe School, Muhlenberg has enjoyed a longstanding alliance with Lehigh Carbon Community College, and we consider them a respected and trusted partner in providing high-quality educational opportunities to the local community. Over the years, many adult students have come to Muhlenberg to build on the solid academic foundation they received at LCCC,” said Williams.
“This agreement further broadens the opportunities LCCC students have when choosing to transfer to earn their bachelor’s degree,” said LCCC president Dr. Ann Bieber. “For both Muhlenberg and Lehigh Carbon, student success is a priority. This agreement confirms that by allowing and encouraging students to continue on to earn their bachelor’s degree and for making that process seamless.”
The initial six pairings of programs were chosen because, with strategic planning/advising (choosing electives that meet both LCCC degree requirements and Muhlenberg general academic requirements), students will transfer to Muhlenberg needing only the 17 modules/units in their chosen accelerated degree program.
“This new agreement identifies certain programs that are especially well-aligned at our respective colleges. LCCC’s two-year curriculum prepares students well in a specific field or industry. These students then come to Muhlenberg ready to focus on the knowledge and skills necessary for future leadership positions,” Williams added. “This cooperative venture will only enhance the already complementary relationship and shared mission between our institutions.”
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education and public health. A member of the Centennial Conference, Muhlenberg competes in 22 varsity sports. Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

The English & Creative Writing major and The Writing Minor encourage its students to study abroad during their junior year and/or to participate in one of our MILA courses in Ireland, Italy and in the United States.
Our MILA course to Ireland, Theater and Creative Writing in Ireland, is offered every other spring and is currently taught by Professors Linda Miller and Brendon Votipka. We travel for approximately 3 weeks to Galway, the Connemara, the Burren and the Aran Islands.
Our MILA course to Italy, Writing About Place, is offered every other spring, in rotation with the Ireland MILA. The course is currently taught by Professors Dawn Lonsinger and Linda Miller. We travel to the Italian Alps and stay at the Brunnenburg Castle for 3 weeks.
Our newest MILA is This Land Is Your Land: The Potomac and will be offered for the first time in Spring 2022. The course is taught by Professors Linda Miller (English), Matt Moore (Theater) and Jeremy Teissere (Neuroscience). The course travels from the base of the Potomac in southern Maryland to its northern fork in West Virginia.

women’s lacrosse wins by the numbers


11 was a big number for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team last year: it was the program record for number of wins in a season. Now, two games into their 2009 campaign, the Mules continue to put up big numbers. 

20-4: The final score of the game against Moravian. The Mules scored the first six goals of the game 



Junior Katie Ferris made her first career start and picked up a game-high six ground balls.



and never looked back, jumping out to a 10-goal lead (13-3) at the half and allowing just one Greyhound goal in the second. 
“The offense is really seeing each other this year,” said junior Amanda McGovern. “We know how we play, and with each game the attack gets stronger. We really work as a team; our unity is a big strength this year.” 
“Our connections from offense to defense was why we scored so many goals today,” said sophomore Danielle Rosen. “Our offense took their time and our defense played well. We were on our feet and ready for anything.” 
The Mules have been on their feet against Moravian for 



Junior Ashley Foltiny scoops up one of her four ground balls. Her play helped Muhlenberg extend its Matte Award lead over Moravian to 7½-3½ .



the past seven years. 130 is the number of goals Muhlenberg has scored on Moravian versus the 33 the Greyhounds have netted. 
4:02: The time it took Rosen to make four of her five assists and score the first of her three goals. 
Seven and Seven: The total number of goals Rosen scored last 
season and the number of goals she has in two games in 2009. 
Three: The number of hat tricks for Muhlenberg. McGovern found the back of the net five times and senior Ruth Morrongiello and Rosen added three goals apiece for the Mules. Three is also the number of Mule players who scored their first career goals. 
“Today was a real confidence booster for those players,” said Rosen. “In games like this they’ve got nothing to lose, so we tell them to go out and prove themselves. And tomorrow in practice, they’ll be telling themselves, ‘hey, we can do this.’” 
“It just shows how ready this team is to play,” said McGovern. “Everyone on this team is just as important whether they’re on or off the bench.” 
35: The number of consecutive games senior Sara Hiller has scored in; she had two goals against Moravian. 
24: The number of consecutive non-conference games Muhlenberg has won. 
“By winning non-conference games, we have a more positive attitude and when we win our intensity is higher,” said Rosen. 
The Mules will need that intensity, when they begin Centennial Conference play this Saturday at No. 6 Gettysburg. 
“We have a few wins under our belt,” said McGovern. “We’re really competitive and really strong and we’re very ready to make a big impact in the conference.”

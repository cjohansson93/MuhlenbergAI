Allentown, Pa. (Oct. 22, 2019) â Muhlenberg College dancers tell their stories through movement, as the Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance Department presents âMoving Stories,â a showcase for dance works created by emerging choreographers, Nov. 7-9 in the Collegeâs Baker Theatre.
Artistic Director Megan Flynn says the program âfeatures original dances as diverse as the choreographersâ points of view and approaches to dancemaking â from narration in physical form to the poetic abstraction of a single idea.â
âThrough collaboration and creative expression,â Flynn says, âtalented advanced choreography students create works that explore the hustle and bustle of a daily commute, draw inspiration from the dynamics of the dinner table, or illuminate the human condition during challenging times.â
âMoving Storiesâ will showcase the work of 12 student choreographers, and feature more than 60 dancers from the departmentâs dance program, which is among the most highly regarded programs of its kind. The concert features costume and lighting designs by the departmentâs acclaimed professional staff.
The 12 original dances feature styles inspired by modern, jazz, tap, hip-hop, partnering work, and Gaga, a movement language developed by Batsheva Dance Company.
Choreographer Heather Downey â20 derives influence for her piece from her appreciation of modern and tap dance. The piece includes both modern dancers and tap dancers, and the tap dancers provide the sound for the work.
âThe rehearsal process is much different from anything I have done here because I have to navigate many pieces of choreography happening simultaneously,â Downey says. âI want the audience to have a strong sensory experience, and I want them to pick and choose what they decide to see and hear.â
Choreographer Maura OâReilly â20 created a piece inspired by the grief, despair, and hopelessness she sometimes felt as an adolescent in the face of ecological crisis. The piece derives choreographic patterns from storytelling moments, which OâReilly hopes will help audiences understand the despair adolescents often feel in this age of climate uncertainty.
âWe have had a lot of discussions around what it means and how it feels to be a young person in the face of this crisis and the sociopolitical impacts of the climate crisis on different people around the world,â OâReilly says.
Choreographer Karlie Lynn Zabin â20 explores an â80s sci-fi inspired theme, sparked by the television show âStranger Things.â
âI hope the audience is transported to a different world,â Zabin says. âMaybe it is the Upside Down, or an â80s sci-fi universe, or a simulation. I hope they feel the textural qualities of the movement and music coinciding.â
Other featured choreographers include Heather Dutton, Greyson Gerdts, Lilianne Gering, Emi Giuseffi, Alex Goshert, Abigail Linnemeyer, Morgan Litzenberger, Hailey McMichael, and Ashley Veglia. Fangfei Miao serves as associate artistic director. Paul E. Theisen Jr. designs lights, and Lex Gurst designs costumes.
âMoving Storiesâ runs Nov. 7-9 in the Baker Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance, Muhlenberg College, 2400 Chew St., Allentown.
Performances are Thursday and Friday, Nov. 7-8, at 8 p.m.; and Saturday, Nov. 9, at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults; $8 for patrons 17 and under; and $8 for students, faculty and staff of all LVAIC colleges.  For groups of 15 or more, tickets are $13.

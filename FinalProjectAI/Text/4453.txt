Slow start dooms men's basketball





The Muhlenberg mens basketball team fell into a 7-0 hole to start the game and could never recover, falling at Dickinson, 67-56, in its last game of 2010.

The Mules (5-3, 1-3), who return to action at Moravians Greyhound Starters Classic on the second day of the New Year, closed to within three on five occasions in the first half, the last at 25-22 with 4:10 left. Ahead 34-28 at the break, the Red Devils (4-4, 3-1) opened the second half with an 11-3 run and led by double digits the rest of the way.

Junior Spencer Liddic had a huge game, scoring 27 points  nearly half of Muhlenbergs total. He also pulled down a game-high 8 rebounds and blocked 3 shots.

The rest of the Mules starters combined for only 7 points, but the team received good minutes off the bench from a trio of players. Freshman James Albano (left) and sophomore Rob Berish (right) combined to shoot 8-of-11 from the field, scoring 9 and 8 points, respectively. Freshman Timmy Harwood added 5 points.

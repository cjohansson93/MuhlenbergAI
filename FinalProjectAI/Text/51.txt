Newsletter 2000A Night at the OperaA group of students from the French Club saw Georges Bizetâs Carmen. We took a van to New York City, and met a lighted Lincoln Center with open arms. First performed in 1875, Carmen is a tragicomic and very accessible opera. This was a good thing, because for many of us the City Operaâs performance was a first opera. Carmen is a lush tale of the dangerous passion of a gypsy factory girl, for whose favors a troupe of townsmen and officials compete.Jeff Baird â03 Les Faux Amis!Mark Remy (Evening College) created this cartoon to remind students of the many pitfalls of faux amis. These are French words that look as if they were cognates and should translate directly into English, but donât. Markâs professor Patricia Conrad notes that Hank might find it useful to know that:Quel temps fait-il? is not What time is it? but rather What is the weather like?Physicienne is not physician but a woman physicist.Librairie is not a library but a bookstoreBack to the Main Newsletter Page.

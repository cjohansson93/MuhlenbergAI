Information for Students


The interdisciplinary nature of the biochemistry program draws students with a variety of interests and future goals. In addition to traditional coursework, there are many research opportunities for students to engage in independent inquiry with Biology and Chemistry faculty.  Research can be conducted during the academic year and/or summer months and students very invested in their research project may wish to apply to the honors program. Overall, the major provides students with a solid undergraduate foundation and prepares students to pursue careers in many aspects of science and medicine.  To learn more about what biochemistry majors are doing while on campus and after graduation, please see the student profiles section.

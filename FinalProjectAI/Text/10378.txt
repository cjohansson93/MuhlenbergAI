The Office of Corporate, Foundation & Government Relations (CFGR) seeks funding from corporations, local and national foundations and government agencies in support of the needs of the College and its faculty. 
CFGR unites faculty and administrative interests in fundraising for equipment, facilities, research, scholarships, endowments or programs with resources available through foundations, corporations and other granting organizations. All local, state and federal government competitive grants and appropriation requests are championed by CFGR. 
Our partnerships with legislative officials provides a conduit for assisting in additional regulatory matters of concern to the institution. This includes securing Commonwealth of Pennsylvania building permits and Department of Environmental Protection clearances.All proposals for grants that are administered by Muhlenberg (where funds are to be paid to and disbursed by the College) must be reviewed and approved by CFGR before they are submitted to the funding agency. This policy, endorsed by the president and provost, identifies the CFGR office as an application clearinghouse, thereby safeguarding the College from multiple applications being submitted to one funding source in the same application cycle. CFGR establishes contacts at the funding agencies, attends or accompanies the president on solicitation visits, facilitates the timing of proposal submission and assists in tracking responses to requests for support. We work closely with the Collegeâs treasurer on grant audits.
Our office can assist you with your grant application. Please contact Stephen Payne, director of corporate, foundation and government relations to set up an introductory meeting to begin the grant process.

the NCAA Division III Women’s Basketball Committee.

The Committee will release polls the next two weeks, then use the final poll to determine selection to and seeding in the NCAA Division III Championship.

The rankings are based on in-region record, opponents’ winning percentage and opponents’ opponents’ winning percentage. 

Muhlenberg has defeated the second-ranked team in the region, DeSales, and lost to the third-ranked team, Scranton.

The Mules also rank highly when it comes to the Division III statistical leaders. Through games of Feb. 10, they were second in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio
(1.14) – a figure they improved to 1.17 with their 19-assist, 9-turnover game at Swarthmore last night. Illinois Wesleyan leads the country with a 1.20 assist-to-turnover
ratio. 

Muhlenberg has been in single digits in turnovers in three straight games and ranks seventh in Division III in fewest turnovers per game (14.2).








Freshman point guard Kelly McKeon gets a big “thumbs-up” for ball-handling abilities. She has a team-leading 85 assists and only 44 turnovers.

Winter 2022 - Energy & Environment Survey
Key Findings Report
The following report summarizes the key findings from the Winter 2022 wave of the National Surveys on Energy and the Environment (NSEE). This survey wave marks the 25th in the series, dating back to the projectâs origin in 2008, under a partnership between Muhlenberg College and the University of Michigan. Beginning in 2020, the NSEE has been produced exclusively by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.

KEY FINDING ONE: American Acceptance of Global Warming Reaches Highest Level on Record
The results from the Winter 2022 NSEE indicate that 76% of adult Americans believe there is solid evidence that temperatures on the planet have risen over the last four decades. This 76% mark is the highest level of acceptance recorded since the inception of the NSEE in 2008. The most recent survey marks the 10th consecutive survey wave, dating back to 2016, in which at least 70% of Americans indicated there was solid evidence of global warming. This consistently high level of acceptance of climate change indicates increasingly durable views among Americans regarding this matter.
 


KEY FINDING TWO: A Solid Majority of Americans Attribute Global Warming at Least Partially to Human Activity
The latest NSEE results show that just under 6 out of 10 Americans (59%) think that there is solid evidence of global warming and that the warming is being at least partially caused by human activity. This result marks the 12th consecutive NSEE wave, dating back to 2015, in which a majority of adult Americans expressed the view that human activity is altering the planetâs climate. In the 2022 findings, 37% of Americans indicated that there is solid evidence of a warming planet, and that the warming is caused primarily by human activity. An additional 22% of Americans agreed there is solid evidence of global warming, and that humans are at least partially responsible for these changes. Notably, nearly 1 in 5 adult Americans (18%) indicate that while there is solid evidence of global warming, the warming is the result of a natural cycle. The 18% level marks the highest portion of Americans to fall into this category since the inception of the NSEE in 2008.


KEY FINDING THREE: A Majority of Americans Report Feeling the Effects of Climate Change
Are Americans experiencing climate change in their daily lives? An expanding body of scientific research indicates that the impacts of climate change are becoming evident in the United States.[1] The results of the latest NSEE wave show a majority (57%) of adult Americans agree that they have personally felt the effects of climate change. Individuals living in the northeast and western United States were the most likely to report experiencing climate change, with 61% of northeasterners, and 60% of westerners indicating they have personally experienced climate change effects.

KEY FINDING FOUR: Americans Continue to Prioritize Mitigation as an Element of Climate Policy
As Americans have overwhelmingly accepted the existence of a warming planet, and most say they have personally experienced the effects of the changing climate, efforts to curb U.S. greenhouse emissions have not produced major success. Given the struggles in mitigating climate change, have Americans concluded that the climate policy focus should turn to adapting to a warming planet? Over the past decade, the NSEE has tested this proposition. When asked if they agree that, âInstead of trying to stop global warming from occurring we should focus on adapting to a warmer climate,â 61% of Americans disagreed with this option in 2022.  This result is very similar to the 2011 findings, when 66% of Americans disagreed with this proposition. The similarity in results suggests that despite a decade of mounting evidence of climate change, and limited mitigation policy achievements, most Americans do not yet believe itâs time to walk away from mitigation as a priority of the nationâs climate policy.

KEY FINDING FIVE: Most Americans View Climate Change as a Public Health Emergency 
A growing body of research points to significant public health impacts from climate change. From exacerbated heat-related illnesses to increased exposure to vector-borne diseases and natural disasters, scientific evidence increasingly links climate change with diminished public health conditions.[2] The NSEE results indicate that a majority (56%) of Americans agree that climate change is a public health emergency, with over a third (37%) strongly agreeing with this characterization. As with many aspects of public opinion regarding climate matters, partisanship is demonstrated to be a key determinant of American views on the public health challenges associated with climate change. Over 8 out of 10 Democrats (82%) agree that climate change is a public health emergency, compared to only about 1 in 4 Republicans (27%) that maintain this opinion.

METHODSThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 720 adult residents of the United States between January 13 and February 8, 2022. Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (202) and cell phones (518). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income and educational attainment to reflect national population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2022. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult residents of the United States, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The sample for the project was generated by the Marketing Systems Group in Horsham, Pennsylvania. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 6%. Due to rounding, the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument, presented in its entirety in the following section, was designed by Dr. Christopher P. Borick, Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO), and Professor of Political Science, in conjunction with Dr. Erick Lachapelle of the University of Montreal. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at christopherborick@muhlenberg.edu.

Women's Tennis Beats Ursinus to Extend Streak
 Thursday, April 17, 2014 - page 2







					 






The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team doubled up Ursinus, 6-3, to extend an impressive and unmatched streak.

The win guaranteed that the Mules (6-3 spring, 5-2) will finish at .500 or better in the Centennial Conference for the 14th consecutive season. That’s no small
feat in an ultracompetitive league that currently has five of its 11 teams ranked in the top 20 in the region (including Muhlenberg at No. 20). No other team
in the CC has finished at .500 or better in each of the last 14 years; Washington entered the 2014 campaign with a 13-year streak but is 0-8.

Muhlenberg finished well above .500 in most of those seasons and is 99-38 (.723) in CC action since 2001.

As they have for most of the last 14 years, the Mules won with balance up and down the lineup. Of the seven players who competed against Ursinus, six picked up
at least one win. Juniors Sharen Resnikoff (left) and Jennifer Goldberg were winners at both singles and doubles.

Ahead 2-1 after doubles, the Mules clinched the match by winning at the top three singles spots. Senior Nina Sanders (right) improved
to 3-0 in the CC at No. 1 with a 6-1, 6-3 victory, and senior No. 2 Emily Szulman prevailed in similarly comfortable fashion (6-1, 6-2).

Goldberg won her second set at love after outlasting her opponent 7-5 in the first.

The win solidified Muhlenberg as one of six teams battling for the five CC playoff spots. The Mules have tough matches against No. 3 Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore
in the next five days, and it is very possible that their regular-season finale at Dickinson (also 5-2) next Saturday will determine a playoff berth.

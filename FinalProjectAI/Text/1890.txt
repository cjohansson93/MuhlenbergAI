Life After 'Berg
After completing our program, graduates transition to a variety of career and educational paths. Many become teachers and work in a variety of settings, from elementary to high school and higher education, including urban and suburban schools, and from public to private to charter schools. Alumni surveys indicate that our graduates find success on the teaching job market and are well prepared to tackle the professional challenges of teaching.
Our students exhibit strong leadership qualities, so it is no surprise that many program graduates end up as school administrators further down the road.
Recent graduates have completed advanced degrees in education at highly respected institutions in the field, such as Michigan State University, Standford University, Bank Street, University of Pennsylvania, University of Hawaii, University of Maryland, Teachers College-Columbia University, Villanova University, Lehigh University, The College of New Jersey, Virginia Commonwealth University, Montclair State University, Towson University, and Northeastern University. Some students pursue specialized degrees in education, such as special education, literacy and math education, teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), as well as students pursuing PhDs in education and other fields.

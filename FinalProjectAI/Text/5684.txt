Women’s Basketball Stymied at Dickinson


For the fourth time in the last two years, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team couldn’t solve the Dickinson defense.

The Mules (12-5, 7-3) went dry from the field for an 11-minute span of the first half and lost to the Red Devils, 64-49, in a battle for first place in the 
Centennial Conference standings. Dickinson (10-5, 9-1) leads Muhlenberg by two games.

Muhlenberg took a 12-9 lead on freshman Kelly McKeon’s
steal and layup with 11:20 left in the first half, but did not make another field goal until junior Erin McSherry made a layup with two seconds left in the half. By then,
Dickinson had a double-digit lead, which swelled to 27 in the second half before the Mules made a late run. 

Last year, the Mules lost three times to the Red Devils, never scoring more than 42 points.

McSherry led Muhlenberg with 12 points, and McKeon finished
with 11.

The Muhlenberg supporters bid farewell to four senior wrestlers in the final home match of the year for the 2007-08 season. 

Joseph DeCampo (141), David Lavin (165), Chris Swensen (197) and Joe Tartar (heavyweight class) were honored for their contribution to the 
Muhlenberg wrestling team prior to the encounter against King’s, lost 27-12.

Lavin and Swensen were two of the four Mule grapplers who recorded a victory on the night. Tartar also fought very well, but lost a close 3-2 decision, while 
DeCampo couldn’t participate because of an injury. 

In the 149 weight class, junior Rob Kein extended his winning streak to four straight bouts after defeating Frankie Davis, 6-4. Billy Hall registered the 
biggest win for the Mules, claiming a 9-2 decision against Anthony Miele at 141.

On March 14, 2005, The Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics will host a discussion by Mark Andrejevic, a professor in the department of communication studies at the University of Iowa, at 7 p.m. in Moyer Hall. This lecture, the second in the semester-long series Ethics in the Information Age, is free and open to the public.
In this talk, entitled "Reality TV: Surveillance, Voyeurism, and the Appeal of the Real," Andrejevic uses cultural theory and interviews with fans, cast members and producers to consider the increasingly productive role of surveillance in the digital era. His analysis of reality television demonstrates how modern society is caught up in the promise of interactivity, a fascination with new media technologies, and an increasingly ambivalent attitude towards surveillance, privacy and voyeurism.
Andrejevic, in addition to being an acclaimed speaker and much-admired professor, is the author of Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched, (2004: Rowman & Littlefield) and has published several journal articles on reality T.V., surveillance and interactivity.

field hockey arrives in barbados


Prior to the start of its regular season, the Muhlenberg field hockey team is spending 10 days in Barbados. Senior Jess Kasza will be sending
reports back during the trip so those of us stuck in our offices can be jealous. Here is her first report on the team’s arrival.

I would like to say our first day was a breeze getting on and off airplanes but it actually started off pretty rough. 
For future reference, one of the least fun things you could ever do at 2 a.m. is get on a mini-Muhlenberg bus with broken air conditioning and 



take a trip to JFK Airport. I know it's not something you would normally do, but I just thought I would let you all know in case you were 
considering doing it. 

After about two hours and five pounds lost in sweat, we arrived at JFK to meet the rest of the team for our first of two flights. Our team greeted 
each other after being apart all summer and, in some cases, even longer for those on the team who were abroad in the spring (Amanda DiMarco and 
Chessie Martinez). The flight from JFK to Miami was relatively painless aside from the cramped seats and we got to Miami on time. 

Our second flight after our 10-minute layover was from Miami to Barbados. We had barely enough time to get off of one plane and on to the other, 
but no one seemed to mind seeing as our ultimate destination of Barbados was so close. However, when things are going that smoothly, it just 
seems like there always has to be some kind of problem. We boarded the plane and it started pouring. Here is where I fell asleep but I was told 
that the rain was the least of our concerns because we still had to wait for a copilot to find his way to the plane. 
Then, after we sat for two hours on the tarmac for varying reasons, we were finally allowed to take off for Bridgeport, Barbados. 

The wheels hit the ground around 4:30 p.m. and this is where we met one of our tour guides, Domonic. We were in the lobby of the Blue Orchids 
Beach Hotel by 5:30 p.m. and down by the ocean water by 5:31 p.m. We met up with our coaches and Domonic and then we were off to dinner at a 
restaurant called Bubba's. The food was decent but kind of expensive; I would give it a 2.75 out of a 5 point scale. 
The exchange rate is US $1 to Barbados $2, in case you were wondering. 

After dinner it was definitely time for everyone to get some sleep because tomorrow the fun starts (aka training sessions and games). 
And no, I did not see Rihanna .......... yet.

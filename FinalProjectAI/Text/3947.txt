Rosen earnsall-region honor


Senior Danielle Rosen of the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team was named to the All-Metro Region second team as selected by the Intercollegiate Womens Lacrosse Coaches Association. 

A two-time All-Centennial Conference honoree, Rosen set career highs with 76 points and 28 assists this season. She ranks second in program history with 212 career points and is in the top 10 in assists (4th, 70) and goals (6th, 142).

Rosen collected nine hat tricks this season to bring her career total to 29, the second-most in Mule history. She also scored eight points in a game five different times this spring, becoming the first player in school history to accomplish that feat.

It is the third year in a row that Muhlenberg has had a player named to the team, and Rosen is the schools 13th all-region selection.

The Centennial Conference dominated the Metro Region, grabbing 21 of the 32 spots on the first and second teams.

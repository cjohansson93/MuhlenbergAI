boyle finalist for all-america team



Although the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Friday, one of its players is still alive.

Junior Lauren Boyle was named one of 40 finalists for the 2008 State Farm Coaches’ All-America Division III Basketball Team. 
The 40 finalists, who are voted upon by Women’s Basketball Coaches Association member coaches in each of the eight WBCA award regions, 
are now in the running for selection to the 10-member State Farm Coaches’ All-America Team, which will be announced next Thursday.

One of five finalists selected from Region 4, Boyle helped lead the Mules to the Centennial Conference championship by averaging a team-high 14.9 points per game.
She also topped the squad in free-throw percentage (.778) and was second in assists (94), steals (36) and blocked shots (14) and fifth in rebounds per game (4.1).
Boyle improved her statistics in just about every category from last season, most notably in assists, where she jumped from 2.5 per game to 3.4.

Boyle scored in double figures in 21 of 28 games, with eight 20-point efforts. She was named to the All-CC first team for the second year in a row and was a
two-time CC player of the week.

Boyle, who will enter her senior season third on the program’s all-time scoring list, is the second Muhlenberg player to be named a finalist for the All-America team. The first
was Meghan Courtney last year.

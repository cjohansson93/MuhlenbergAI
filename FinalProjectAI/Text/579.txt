Writing Assistant
This program puts tutors in the classroom. WAs are assigned to First-Year Seminars taught by faculty from various departments, and work closely with the professor to help students make the transition from high school to college writing. WAs attend class, know the class material, lead workshop sessions on writing, and meet one-on-one with each student at least three times throughout the semester.

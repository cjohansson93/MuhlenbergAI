After the weekly challenges of a college life, we know the calming and restorative features of rest and Shabbat bring so much comfort to our souls. We gather every Friday night for Shabbat services and dinner. Check out our calendar for more information about Shabbat and holiday experiences, including services and meals!
For more information, check out our FAQ about the 2021-2022 academic year.
For the collegeâs Religious Holidays and Class Attendance Policy, click here.
If you would like to spend a Shabbat with Hillel overnight please contact either Melissa Falk, Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid in Admissions or April Cunningham, Assistant Director of Hillel with at least two weeks notice. We can try to accommodate requests on shorter notice, but cannot make any guarantees as we need to coordinate with student hosts.

women’s basketball returns to broadway


Last year, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team started what it hopes will be a tradition when it went to see Hair on Broadway in
early January. The team returned to New York last night, and senior Sheila Cook filed this report:

Yesterday, the Muhlenberg womens basketball team went on a different kind of road trip.  Rather than packing our bags for a game, we dressed up for a trip to Manhattan to see Billy Elliot on Broadway.  

After a long two-and-a-half hour practice, we all headed home to shower and get ready. By 2:15, we met back at Memorial Hall and boarded two vans. One van had a lively trip filled with chatter and even a spelling bee.  Sophomore Kate Clawson claims to be the winner of the bee, but it was all in good fun.

The vans dropped us off at the Secaucus train station.  We bought our tickets, our coffees from Dunkin Donuts and found our track.  This was 




the first train ride for our manager, freshman Morgan Duggan, and she proved to be quite surprised when an express train passed through our station without stopping.  Lets just say, there might have been a scream heard, and I think she was a little nervous to get on our train when it arrived. But we all boarded and less than 10 minutes later, we were in Pennsylvania Station.

The team headed toward Times Square to show some of the freshmen the 
more touristy sights.  It was Colleen Caldwells first trip ever to Manhattan and only Katy Mittons third. Colleen said that while New York City reminded her of Philadelphia, there were A LOT more people walking like they were on a mission and the lights were much brighter.  

In Times Square, we met up with former womens basketball players Kaitlin Strumph 09, Katelyn Tolan 10, Maiza Mock 10 and Erin McSherry 09.  Since we had now acquired such a large group, we made the executive decision to split up into two parties.

The first party, under the direction of junior Kathleen Naddaff, went to Dallas BBQ in the heart of Midtown.  They enjoyed a delicious dinner and even got up for a few dances on the large dance floor.  Needless to say, this group was the life of the Thursday night dinner crowd.

The second group headed up a few more blocks to the Lime Jungle.  Here, we enjoyed some delicious Mexican treats.  Juniors Katy Rossino and Alexandra Chili had found this restaurant together on a previous trip to the City.  We had a great time catching up with the alumna and sharing funny stories of the previous semester at the Berg.  Alexandra Chili was, in her own words, obsessed with dinner.

After dinner, we made the walk to meet up with everyone at the Imperial Theatre.  Junior Kimberly Mui kept the Twitter Nation abreast of any interesting breaking news or quotes from that walk.  Senior Alexandra Berlins quote asking if there was a halftime (meaning intermission) was definitely my favorite. 

We made it just in time for the play.  I could not have been more impressed.  I love Broadway, and Billy Elliot is definitely one of the best plays I have ever seen.  The story was extremely heartfelt and at times quite sad.  But, moments later I would find myself hysterically laughing from some hilarious line, typically said by Billys best friend Michael or grandmother.  Even though many of the actors were in their preteen years, they were absolutely fabulous, but nothing compared to the dancing!  It was amazing.  

However, as with everything great, the play did eventually come to an end along with our stay in Manhattan.  We made the walk back to Penn Station, boarded our train and began a lively discussion of the play.  

Coach Rohn said that his only wish was that we would talk as much on defense as we did in during the train ride.

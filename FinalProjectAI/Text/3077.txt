Janice isn’t a name you’ll find anywhere on the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse roster, but she plays an important role for the team this season.

“She is our inspiration,” said senior Megan Wilson, a two-time varsity letterwinner and returning midfielder for the Mules.

The team has strong relationships on the field and off, and Janice

is just one of the group’s inside jokes that keep the morale up and the laughs coming.

“Janice is our alter ego,” explained Marguerite Farrell, one of the Mules’ senior captains. “She’s a hypothetical person that describes a personality trait — Janice is a louder, bigger, beefier version of us; she helps us throughout the season.”

After a breakthrough year in 2008 that included school records for wins and goals in a season and the first playoff appearance in school history, Muhlenberg is aspiring to be just as Janice-like in 2009 as it opens its season Sunday at Randolph-Macon.

“Last year we worked hard and were really driven,” said Farrell, “and it’s carried over

to this year. With fall ball and in the preseason everyone had a lot of intensity. The seniors set the bar pretty high last year, but we’re confident we can get there again.”

“There’s pressure, but it’s a good pressure,” said Wilson. “It’s an exciting feeling.”

The Mules are returning 12 varsity letterwinners, including two of the team’s All-Centennial Conference selections from last year, and four players who recorded 30 or more goals in 2008.

“We’re well-rounded and have depth all over the field,” said Wilson. “We have a lot of people doing different things. Everyone brings something different to the team and we really need everyone.”

“We have balance all over the field,” agreed Farrell. “We don’t just have one or two key players, but we’re strong all over.”

Leading the Mules’ attack is senior Sara Hiller, who enters the 2009 season with a school-record 33-game scoring streak, dating back to her sophomore year. Hiller scored 32 goals last season and ranks second among current Muhlenberg players with 108 career points. Sophomore Danielle Rosen, the other returning letterwinner in the attack, will look to build on her seven-goal, four-assist season in 2008.

Other top scoring threats come from the midfield, led by seniors Ruth Morrongiello and Wilson. Morrongiello paced Muhlenberg with 41 goals last season, a number that included her 100th career goal; she leads active Mule players with 139 career points. Junior Amanda McGovern returns after a 37-goal, 17-assist, All-CC year in 2008. McGovern was also second on the Mules with 33 draw controls. 

Juniors Ashley Foltiny, who scooped up 36 ground balls, second on the team, and Alyssa Bascelli, who led the team with 20 caused turnovers, will also see plenty of time in the midfield, as will junior Danielle Scarrone and sophomore Lauren DeCarle.

The defense is led by seniors Farrin Jay and Farrell. Last season Farrell was third on the team with 32 ground balls and 14 caused turnovers. They will lead three newcomers on the defense.

Allisyn Vachon returns between the pipes after starting all 16 games in goal and making 140 saves as a freshman last season.

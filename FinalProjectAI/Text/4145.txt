Women’s Lacrosse Drops Home Finale






The Muhlenberg women's lacrosse team had its playoff prospects take a hit with a 17-9 loss to Dickinson in its last home game.

The Mules (7-7, 3-5) are still mathematically alive for a Centennial Conference playoff berth but will need to beat Ursinus in Friday's regular-season finale and get some help.

After falling behind 3-0, Muhlenberg appeared to be in good shape when it scored four straight goals to take a 5-4 lead with two minutes left in the first half. But the Red Devils (6-9, 3-4) tied the score, went ahead 6-5 with 16.8 seconds on the clock and then reeled off the first eight goals of the second half to break the game open.

Sophomore Molly Davin scored four goals to lead the Mules, while senior Danielle Rosen netted three points to move into second place on the program's all-time scoring list with 211 for her career. At the opposite end of the spectrum, freshman Claudia Rogers scored her first career goal,
and junior Becky Ritter notched her first goal of the season.

Freshman Kaitlyn McCaffrey, who entered the week 11th in Division III in caused turnovers per game, added four to her total to move
to within two of the school record of 38 in a season. Sophomore Jill Freda also caused four turnovers.

Rosen (above middle) was honored along with fellow seniors Lauren DeCarle, Christine Van Hise, Allisyn Vachon and Maggie Sullivan (left to right) prior to the game.

The Muhlenberg men's golf team made an early visit to the site of next weekend's Centennial Conference Championships and came away with a good feel for the course.

The Mules shot a 314 at the Stonewall Golf Links in Elverson, Pa., to finish in second place, one stroke behind York. The five other CC teams at the tournament were all at least 16 strokes behind.

All five Muhlenberg golfers shot 81 or better. Senior Jordan Carpenter (above) finished second with a 5-over-par 75, tying his career-low round. Senior Zachary Oyer tied for fourth at 78, two strokes ahead of freshman Chris DiMaio.

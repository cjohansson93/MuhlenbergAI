This fall, the Muhlenberg College English Department will sponsor the semester-long course "Living Writers," which brings six burgeoning and established authors to campus.   In addition to interacting with students, each author will hold a public reading and book signing, all of which are free and open to the public.
Students enrolled in the course read recent works from the selected authors and then interact with the writers directly as they visit campus for a day. Writers attend classes, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening.  
For more information on the series, please the English Department website.

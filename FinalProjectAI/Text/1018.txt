25Live FAQ's











          What is 25Live Pro?
  








CollegeNetâs 25Live Pro is Muhlenberg Collegeâs central source for all event reservations and room bookings. This system enables users to view event information and request the use of a location from any computer with internet capability.






          How do I access 25Live PRO?
  








You can access 25Live PRO through the following link: https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/muhlenberg
Sign in to 25Live PRO using the Muhlenberg College ONELOGIN Portal with your username and password. For faculty and staff, your user name is your first and last name, all one word. For students, your user name is your network ID. The password is what you use to log into your Muhlenberg desktop computer. Contact the Support Desk for username and password assistance.






          Who can use 25Live PRO?
  








Anyone with a Muhlenberg Login will be able to access 25Live PRO. Faculty, staff and a limited number of student representatives from each College recognized student club/organization will be able to request locations and resources. Visitors to the website can view basic event information.
 
Student Representatives:
There are two club/organization members who are designated to access 25Live Pro on behalf of each recognized club/organization in good standing.  This is typically selected by club/organization officers and defaults to the top two officers if no names were provided. If you are the primary scheduler for a club/organization, please work with Student Activities to make adjustments to Organization contacts to access 25Live Pro and to complete the appropriate forms.






          Why should I use 25Live PRO? Can I just call the location scheduler to reserve a space or check availability?
  








25Live PRO as it is the only acceptable and recognized method for scheduling events on campus. Using this system is an efficient method of finding an available location for your event. 25Live PRO also provides you with valuable information regarding our campusâs locations including photos, diagrams, capacities, features, etc.






          What are the recommended Browsers?
  








Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are recommended. Internet Explorer and Safari are strongly discouraged.






          What should I do if I need extra setup and breakdown time?
  








If you need additional time in a location prior to the beginning of your event or after your event concludes, you can add this to the pre-event and post-event fields. Be sure to also schedule the appropriate amount of setup time for housekeeping, as well as pre-event and post-event times for catering per the Collegeâs scheduling policies displayed to the right of these fields on the event wizard.






          What should I do if the location for my event is locked?
  








Please contact Campus Safety at 484-664-3112.






          How do I request a specific setup for a location?
  








After selecting a location for your event in 25Live PRO, click on the View Occurrences link below the name of the room. A list of available setups for the location you are requesting will appear. Select the setup you wish to request and enter the maximum anticipated headcount. If you are requesting a diagram, select See Diagram as the setup. Contact  teamseegers@muhlenberg.edu with either a drawing of the diagram requested or a copy of a diagram from a past event which you would like to replicate.






          I want to give instructions about my locations, resources, etc. Where should I put them?
  








Any additional information you wish to share with the location scheduler or resource managers should be included in the Comments field at the end of the form.






          Can I order Media Services equipment through 25Live PRO?
  








Media Services requests are not available through 25Live PRO at this time. Media Services should continue to be requested via the Media Services Request Form on the Collegeâs Departmental Forms site. This form is only accessible to faculty/staff members. Students should ask their clubâs advisor to complete the form for their events.






          How do I request catering for my event?
  








You can request Catering within 25Live PRO through the Resources section of the request form. Search for the type of catering service you wish to request (Example: breakfast, lunch, reception, break) and click on the resource to add it to your request.






          Why doesnât my event appear on the calendar in 25Live PRO immediately after I submit my request?
  








Only approved and confirmed events are displayed on the 25Live PRO calendar and availability grid. When an event is submitted, it is initially a tentative event. The event is not approved until the location scheduler reviews the request, approves or denies it, and changes the status to either âconfirmedâ or âdeniedâ. You will receive an e-mail from the location scheduler with either a confirmation or denial.






          Who determines whether my request is granted or denied?
  








There is a designated location scheduler for each location on campus who determines whether a request is granted or denied.






          How far in advance may I make a request for a location?
  








You may submit a request for a location 365 days in advance.






          I misspelled the title of my event, can I correct my mistake online?
  








If your event is still in the tentative state, you can correct this mistake in 25Live PRO by clicking âEdit this Eventâ. If your event has been confirmed, you can correct this mistake by completing the online Change/Cancellation form. Select âModify An Existing Eventâ from the drop down menu and then describe the changes you are requesting in the description field.






          How long does it take to receive confirmation or denial for my requested location?
  








You should expect a response from the location scheduler within 3 business days. Please note, during peak periods in the semester, response times may take up to 5 business days.






          Need more help?
  








25Live PRO has a built in Help page that you can access by clicking on the âHelpâ button in the top right hand corner of the site. You can also e-mail teamseegers@muhlenberg.edu.

Scotty Wood Tournament 2011 Similar to Scotty Wood Tournament 2010

The 30th Scotty Wood Tournament did not lack for excitement, but fortunately for fans of the Muhlenberg basketball programs, it was not much in the area of originality.

For the second year in a row, the Muhlenberg women’s and men’s team swept the Scotty Wood titles. It’s the first time in the 19 years the women have
been part of the tournament that both teams won in consecutive years.

Even the tournament MVPs were the same: preseason All-Americans Alexandra Chili for the women and Spencer Liddic for the men.

In both championship games, the Mules rode a late first-half surge into the locker room and were never seriously challenged in the second half. The women defeated
New Jersey, 74-63, and the men outscored Immaculata, 99-83.

Baseball Can't Hold Early Lead and Falls in Florida Finale

Vila is hitting .500 with 20 RBI in 11 games. He has a .905 slugging percentage.


The Muhlenberg baseball team finished an incredibly successful Spring Break trip with a rough loss.

The Mules (9-2) led 12-0 after four at-bats, 
but Baruch scored in each of the last six innings and won 14-13 on a walkoff single in the bottom of the ninth.

Still, Muhlenberg went 6-2 in Florida – its best Spring Break record ever.

The Mules built their early lead with two big innings, scoring five in the first and seven in the fourth.

 Freshman Jimmy Cody, batting leadoff for the first time in his Muhlenberg career, took an immediate liking to the position, homering on the third pitch of the game. Another freshman, Nick Plinio, hit a three-run triple later in the inning. 

The big hit in the fourth inning was a grand slam home run by senior Nick Busillo. Freshman Chris Manfredonia followed the big blast with a triple and scored the final run of the inning on a passed ball.

The bats went quiet after that as the Bearcats (2-5) clawed back in the game. The Mules managed only three baserunners in the final five innings, one coming in the eighth when junior Joseph Vila hit his third home run of the season.

Manfredonia finished 3-for-5 with an RBI, and Vila went 2-for-4 and scored three runs.

The three home runs gave Muhlenberg 11 for the season, one more than it had all last year.

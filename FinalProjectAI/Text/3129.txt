women’s hoops back in top 25


After two weeks out, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team returned to the D3hoops.com top 25.

The Mules were ranked as high as 14th earlier in the season, but dropped out following losses to Moravian and Marymount – both top-25
teams. Muhlenberg rebounded with four straight wins and is No. 25 in this week’s poll.

The Mules have remained in the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association poll, which is released on Tuesdays, all season. They were No. 23 the last
two weeks.

Muhlenberg is 11-2 overall and is in first place in the Centennial Conference with an 8-0 mark. Of the five teams with two or three losses, the Mules
have beaten three of them and face the other two for the first time this week: Dickinson (5-2) at home on Thursday and Washington (3-3) away on Saturday.

The statistics show one of the reasons for the team’s success: Muhlenberg leads the CC in both scoring offense (69.8 points per game) and
field-goal percentage defense (.372).

Defensive Player of the Year McDonoughleads all-CC football selections







Fresh off a record-tying ninth Centennial Conference championship, the Muhlenberg football team landed eight players and one coach on the all-conference team.




McDonough has amassed 220 tackles in his three-year career.





Cobb earned CC player of the week honors after his 4.5-sack performance against Ursinus.



Five Mules earned first-team honors to bring Muhlenbergs all-time total to a CC-high 119 first-teamers.

Senior linebacker Patrick McDonough was also recognized as the conferences defensive player of the year. He averages a CC-high 10.7 tackles per game and is the fourth Mule linebacker to be named player of the year. McDonough was also only one of two unanimous first-team selections.





Joining McDonough on the defensive first team were junior defensive lineman Kenneth Cobb and junior defensive back Chris Hartzell.

Cobb has set a new Muhlenberg single-season record for sacks (11.0). He also has made 16.5 tackles for loss this season, while forcing three fumbles and breaking up seven passes.

Hartzell has been a disruptive force on both defense and special teams. He ranks second on the team with 38 solo tackles and is third in the CC with 13 passes defended (11 pass breakups and 2 interceptions).






On the offensive side of the ball, sophomore running back Terrence Dandridge and junior offensive lineman Michael Porembski were both named to the first team.




Dandridge is already ninth on Muhlenbergs career rushing list with 1,546 yards.



Dandridge leads the CC in rushing (104.1 ypg) and




Donnelly is the winningest coach in Mule history.



 has set a new Mule sophomore single-season rushing record (1,041 yards). He also leads Muhlenberg in scoring with 10 rushing touchdowns.






After starting the final three games of last season, Porembski has been a rock at center from the beginning of practice in 2010. He is the cerebral leader of an offensive line that has helped pave the way for the conferences second-highest rushing attack (159.1 ypg). 

Senior offensive guard  Mark Bigelli earned all-conference honors for the second time in his career. After being named to the second team in 2008, Bigelli missed most of last season with an injury. He has returned to the lineup this fall and performed well, earning second-team honors once again.

A pair of big hitters, senior linebacker Mark Accomando and junior defensive back Chase Nadell, were named to the second-team defense. Accomando is second on the team with 54 tackles, including five tackles for loss.

After being named an honorable mention defensive back last season, Nadell has picked off three passes and made 43 tackles this year. He was also named the conference's second-team kick returner. Nadell leads the CC and ranks third nationally with an average of 30.6 yards per kickoff return. He has also added an 80-yard kickoff return for touchdown against Juniata.




Porembski has started 13 straight games at center.





Hartzell has made six interceptions and broken up 15 passes in his career.






Rounding out Muhlenbergs contingent is 14th-year head coach Mike Donnelly. He earned the CCs coach of the year award for the second time in three seasons after leading a turnaround that saw the Mules go from 3-7 and tied for seventh in the conference last season to 7-3 and league co-champions in 2010.

This is the 10th time in the past 12 years, and 17th time overall, that Muhlenberg has had at least four players named to the All-CC first team. 

The Mules finished in a three-way tie for the CC title and received the conferences automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament. Muhlenberg is schedule to play at Wesley in a first-round matchup at noon on Saturday.

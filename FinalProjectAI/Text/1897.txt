Professor Sally Richwine has been teaching in the Education Department at Muhlenberg since 1989, becoming a full time Lecturer and Director of the Fieldwork Program in 1994.
She earned her undergraduate degree from Muhlenberg and her Masterâs in Education in Counseling and School Psychology certification from Lehigh University. She was a practicing school psychologist in the public schools from 1979 to 1986.
Her current courses include Introduction to Special Education and Seminar in Assessment and Evaluation. She has also taught Educational Psychology. As Director of the Fieldwork Program, she works closely with surrounding school districts, both urban and suburban, placing 125-150 students each semester.
Her research interests include work in the field of Aspergerâs Syndrome, having coauthored an article with her colleague in the Psychology Department, Mark Sciutto. She and Dr. Carbone (Education) recently presented their scholarship that examines the effects of NCLB on teacher work, classroom practices and pre-service teachersâ conceptions of teaching.
She was inducted as a founding charter member of the School of Continuing Studies chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda, the national Honor Society for nontraditional students. Her Muhlenberg ties extend beyond the campus. She is married to a Muhlenberg graduate and has two daughters who are 2003 and 2009 alums.

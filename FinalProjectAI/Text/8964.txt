Applying to Graduate School in Sociology or Anthropology?
Here are some things that you should include as part of your application packet:


Statement of purpose/interest*


Curriculum vitae* (a.k.a. the academic resume)


Official transcripts* (1-2 copies)


GRE scores*


Letters of recommendation (usually 3)


Writing samples* (0-2)


Application fee ($50-100) â check with the graduate school office of the institution to which you are applying to see if this fee can be waived for financial hardship.


Deadlines for submission (usually between Dec. & Feb.)


* indicates more information below
The Statement of Purpose:


This is possibly the single most important part of your application


Should be approximately 1-2 pages


Should include the following information:

Why you are applying to the department/institution
Your broad research interests (and how they fit with the departmentâs overall perspective)
Your background in addressing/developing these interests (e.g., fieldwork conducted, papers written, conference presentations, travel abroad, competitive awards, key courses that have prepared you or made a significant impact)
Your theoretical approach to the discipline (or approaches/scholars that have influenced your way of thinking about the discipline)
Do you have a specific research project in mind that you would like to pursue for your masterâs/doctoral degree?
Which faculty members are you most interested in working with at that department and how do your interests intersect with theirs?




Curriculum Vitae:


This is your resume of professional/scholarly activity


Generally, you should include some variation on the following subjects:

Education (college level, dates of graduation, GPA, cum laude, etc.)
List of research interests
Honors/Awards (related to your scholarly work; e.g., Deanâs List, Phi Beta Kappa, departmental/university awards, paper awards, etc.)
Conference presentations/Publications (Most schools will not expect publications at this point, so donât worry if you donât have any!)
Research Experience (Participation in field projects, laboratory projects, data collection, etc.)
Language Skills
Service/Membership in professional societies
List of Referees (people submitting letters of recommendation on your behalf and their contact information




Official Transcripts:


You will have to request official transcripts from the Registrarâs office (they will send them to the schools/departments to which you are applying)


Plan ahead b/c they cost $$

$5 (5-7 days processing + regular mail)
$20 (Immediate processing + regular mail)
$35 (Immediate processing + overnight shipping)




Graduate Record Examination (GRE):


Testing is year round at several locations including Prometric Testing Center in Allentown


Online registration: www.gre.org


Score reporting takes approximately two weeks


You will be taking the General test (there are no subject tests for Anthropology or Sociology)


Cost = $140


3 Sections: Verbal, Analytical, and Quantitative


You can take it once a month â your second score is almost always at least 100 points higher than your first


Take a PREP course or download some practice tests:

Writing Samples:


Each application will specify whether you should provide writing sample(s)


If you are not asked to provide a writing sample, do NOT provide one.


If asked to submit a writing sample(s), remember that it does not necessarily have to be a paper written in your discipline. The school wants to see your potential as a writer: your writing style, your analytical skills, and your ability to think/write critically about a topic.

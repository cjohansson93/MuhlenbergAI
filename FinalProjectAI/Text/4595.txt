They led 10-9 before the Crusaders (3-3) closed the set on a 16-5 run.

After opening its season with a pair of 5-0 wins, the Muhlenberg men's soccer team is ranked fourth in the region by the National Soccer Coaches

Association of America.

The Mules are one of four Centennial Conference teams 



in the top five in the region, behind Johns Hopkins (No. 1) and Swarthmore (No. 2) and ahead
of Dickinson (No. 5). Defending national champion Messiah is ranked third in the region, while future Mule opponents DeSales and Drew are No. 8 and
No. 10 , respectively.

Two of the players responsible for the strong start were honored by the Centennial Conference. 



Junior Cody Antonini was named co-offensive player
of the week, and senior Matt Cecconi was named defensive player of the week. 

Antonini (right), the 2009 CC player of the year, picked up where he left off, becoming the first Mule in 43 years to open a season with 
back-to-back multiple-goal games. He had two goals and an assist vs. Marywood (one of which is shown above) and two more goals vs. Centenary, 
helping Muhlenberg tie a school record with 10 total goals in its first two games.

Cecconi (left), the only returning starter in the Mules' back four, led a defense that allowed only five shots (three on goal) in 
the two games. He also contributed to the offense with an assist against Centenary after intercepting a pass.

A Visit by Chilean Poet Leonel Lienlaf
The Mapuche poet Leonel Lienlaf will visit Muhlenberg this March. Lienlaf, whom Professor James Barnhart-Park met as he researched his dissertation, is the author of several documentary scripts relating to indigenous rights and cultural / environmental conservation. He has done scholarly work on ethno-semiotics and the nature of oral poetry, and has made a musical compact disc containing his reading of his own poetry accompanied by traditional Mapuche music. He has also lead and participated innumerous literary workshops in Chile and abroad. Lienlafâs 1989 collection Nepey Ãi GÃ¼Ã±Ã¼n Piuke (Se ha despertado el ave de mi corazÃ³n [The bird of my heart has woken]) was the first full-length collection of poetry to be published in bilingual format (Mapuzugun/Spanish) in Chile. It earned him the Premio Municipal de Literatura â a national prize also given to Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda. His work has been published in various anthologies, and translated into several languages.

mckeon breaks career recordin women’s basketball win


For directory assistance, dial 411. For basketball assistance, call on Kelly McKeon

The senior point guard became the career assists leader for the Muhlenberg womens basketball program as the Mules defeated Dickinson, 68-52.

McKeon came into the game needing three assists to overtake Kristen Piscadlo (2003-06) and got exactly that many, breaking the record when she fed sophomore Alita Zabrecky



Senior Sheila Cook was one of four Mules in double figures, scoring 11 points.





for a layup with a long pass late in the first half. McKeons 425 assists rank fourth in Centennial Conference history.

Im very excited, said McKeon on breaking the 

record. Part of the point guards job is to be the team leader. Ive done it for a number of years and this is a good record that shows it.

Three more good records are 84-22 (the Mules record since McKeon arrived as a freshman), 16-5 (the Mules record this year) and 12-4 (the Mules CC record this year). The win against 





Despite missing the first eight games, McKeon leads the Mules with 51 assists this season.





Dickinson kept Muhlenberg in second place in the CC with four games to go, a game behind Johns Hopkins and a game ahead of Gettysburg.

McKeons night included much more than the assists record. She also scored a game-high 17 points, pulled down 5 rebounds and recorded 3 steals without committing a turnover in 29 minutes. Three times in the second half, she made a jump shot just ahead of the shot-clock buzzer, simultaneously helping the Mules take some time off the clock and extend their lead on the Red Devils (8-13, 6-11). 

It was a vintage performance for the 2010 CC player of the year, and a far cry from the last time Muhlenberg played Dickinson. That was McKeons first game of the season after missing the first eight with an injury, and she was rusty as the Mules suffered their first loss of the season, 63-60.

I think Ive just been trying to get better every game, she said. I feel like I have my legs now, and Im definitely more in synch than I was the first game at Dickinson.

We had [the loss at Dickinson] in our minds, she added. I think everyone was pumped up to play this game.

It showed. Muhlenberg was particularly sharp on defense in the first half, forcing 15 turnovers and holding the Red Devils scoreless for a nine-minute stretch. 

Already ahead 19-11 with 10:50 to go in the half, the Mules went on a 14-0 run before Dickinson scored again with 1:45 on the clock. Twice during that span, on back-to-back possessions, Muhlenberg forced Dickinson to take a rushed shot with the shot clock winding down.

The Red Devils hit three three-pointers in the last two minutes of the half to make the score 35-20 at the break. They continued to cut into the lead at the start of the second half, drawing to within 11 (at 42-31) before the Mules slammed the door with consecutive layups in span of 19 seconds.

On the first, freshman Leeann Lanza was inbounding the ball against the press when she tried to find Zabrecky near halfcourt. The long pass sailed in between Zabrecky and a Dickinson player and right into the hands of junior Alexandra Chili, who dribbled in for an easy two.

On the next possession, McKeon stole the ball, leading to Zabreckys fast-break layup off a pass from Chili. The Devils never got closer than 13 points the rest of the game.

Chili finished with 13 points, shooting 3-for-5 from three-point range, to move into 18th place on the CC all-time scoring list with 1,376 points. Reigning CC player of the week Zabrecky added 10 points, Lanza recorded 8 points and 8 rebounds, and junior Kathleen Naddaff blocked 4 shots.

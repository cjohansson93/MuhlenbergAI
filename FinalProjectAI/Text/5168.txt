Five members of the Muhlenberg softball team earned recognition from the coaches in the Centennial Conference.

Senior second base Samantha Crist was voted to the All-CC first team. Senior catcher RiRi Ferrigno and sophomore utility player Ashley Brewer made the second team, while sophomore pitcher Alyssa Bruckner received honorable mention.

First-year head coach Roni Rivera was named coach of the year after turning the Mules from a team that tied for last place in 2008 to one that finished a game out of first in 2009. The eight-game swing in CC play tied for the best in league history. 

Crist carries only a .217 batting average but leads the team in stolen bases (12) and walks (13) and is second in RBI (17). She drove in 12 runs with only 10 hits in CC games and tied for the league lead with seven stolen bases in league play. She also hit five of her seven doubles against CC opponents.

Ferrigno led the CC with a .471 batting average in league games. Overall, she is hitting .367 with three home runs and 27 RBI.

Brewer was third in the CC in both batting average (.438) and earned-run average (1.66) in league play. Her average of .417 in all games ranks fourth in the CC, and she is fifth with 102 strikeouts as a pitcher.

Bruckner is 9-6 overall with a 1.96 ERA and six shutouts. Four of her shutouts came in CC games, including a no-hitter against Dickinson.

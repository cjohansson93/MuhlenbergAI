It Grows Like Ivy
The Caring Place is a free healthcare clinic of the Lehigh Valley hospital in Allentown, PA. Started from scratch with minimal operatinghours and volunteer staffing, The Caring Place has grown to becomeone of the best-funded projects by Lehigh Valley Hospital. Now, uninsured citizens from across Allentown, the third biggest city in Pennsylvania, come to The Caring Place for all types of care ranging from dia-betes education to prenatal group visits. It Grows Like Ivy picks up thenarrative of The Caring Place at a poignant and liminal time in theclinicâs development. The transition from a smaller free clinic to a largerfederally-funded health center unearths major questions for Dr. AbbyLetcher, a head doctor at the clinic. Struggling with the success of herultimate goal to bridge healthcare and community building, Abby care-fully pioneers a revival of a personalized model of medicine with anever-questioning, introspective slant.

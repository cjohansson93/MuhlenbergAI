Gil Schpero '11, assistant director of Hillel, was recently named an "Ally of the Year" by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) for his efforts in guiding student activism. He was honored, along with three other individuals, at an event celebrating the most accomplished AIPAC-trained student activists, campus professionals and innovators in the nation on March 3, 2013.
Other recipients of "Ally of the Year" include Rabbi Pini Dunner, Mashgiach Ruchani at Yeshiva University Boys High School of Los Angeles; and Elan Carr, International President of Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity.
Muhlenberg College Hillel serves the most active Jewish campus population in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. Over 33% of the 2200 member student body at Muhlenberg College is Jewish. Over two-thirds of the Jewish students on campus are active in Hillel, making it the largest student organization of any kind on campus. Hillel is recognized by the college administration as a model for quality student-focused programming and chaplaincy. Jewish students are a proud and energetic group at Muhlenberg.
AIPAC is a 100,000-member grassroots movement of activists committed to ensuring Israel's security and protecting American interests in the Middle East and around the world. AIPAC’s priority is to ensure that both America and Israel remain strong and that they collaborate closely together.

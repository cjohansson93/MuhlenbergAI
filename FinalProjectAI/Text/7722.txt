Women's Soccer Ties Best Start in Program History
 Thursday, September 11, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team tied the best start in program history by winning at Bryn Mawr, 2-0, in its Centennial Conference opener.

The Mules’ 5-0 record matches the start of the 2008 team. The 2014 Mules have outscored their five opponents by a margin of 8-1. It’s the first time ever that Muhlenberg has allowed only one goal total in its first five games.


For the third straight game, Muhlenberg outshot its opponent by at least 10, taking 16 shots to six for the Owls (1-3). Sophomore Tori Gonzalez made three saves for her second straight shutout.

Freshman Carly DeNigris (left) took advantage of a Bryn Mawr miscue to score the first goal of the game, picking up the ball after a giveaway off a back pass in the 21st minute and firing it into the net for her first career goal.

That goal stood up as the only one for almost the entire game. The Mules were trying to kill off the clock in the corner in the waning minutes, but when Bryn Mawr doubled the ball, it was passed back to freshman Phoebe Shields, who lofted it into the box. Junior Jacelin Muschlitz beat the goalie to the ball and headed it in for her fourth career goal.

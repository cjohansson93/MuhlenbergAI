Research InterestsLack of awareness of radon risk is a major public health issue. Over 21,000 Americans per year die from lung cancer caused by inhalation of this naturally-occurring, odorless, colorless, radioactive gas that can accumulate in homes, schools, and other buildings. My research is in environmental health risk communication, specifically on the detrimental health effects of radon gas exposure, the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking.   Currently, three students are working with me to determine what areas of the Allentown community are most vulnerable to the health effects of radon, and how we might better communicate radon risk to these vulnerable populations.  In addition, we are looking at ways to change policy by revising building code regulations in Allentown that would require radon testing in rental properties and mitigation if levels are found to be too high.  Students who are interested in working with me on my radon research or independently on their own public health research project are encouraged to contact me.

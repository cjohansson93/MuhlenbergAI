baseball piles on runs in florida finale


The Muhlenberg baseball team needed its 20-hour bus ride back home from Florida to rest up after circling around the bases all morning and afternoon in its Spring
Break-closing doubleheader 



Junior Edward Risener had a two-run single in the seven-run inning and drove in four runs on the day.




against Wisconsin Lutheran.

The Mules evened their record at .500 with a 15-2, 21-6 sweep. The 36 runs shattered the school record for scoring


Softball Drops Two



The Muhlenberg softball pitching staff had a rough day in Florida, allowing 28 runs in losses to 24th-ranked Washington (Mo.) and Walsh.

Freshman Alyssa D’Addio hit her first career home run, a two-run blast in the 17-4 loss to Washington.

The Mules went 3-7 on their trip to Florida.

in a doubleheader; the previous mark was 29 vs. Gettysburg in 1982.

In the second game, Muhlenberg 

was the home team, meaning it scored 21 runs in only six turns at bat. It was the first time since 1981 that the Mules reached the 20-run mark
while winning a doubleheader game; they lost to Hartwick, 22-21, in a seven-inning game in 2006.

Freshmen Jeff Puklin and Adam Scarzafava, who entered the day with a combined total of two hits and no RBI, enjoyed breakout games, with Puklin driving in
six runs in the opener and Scarzafava duplicating that feat in the nightcap. Puklin, batting eighth in the order, ripped two-out, bases-clearing doubles in both the
first and seventh innings of Game 1. Scarzafava went 3-for-3 in Game 2, recording two of his six RBI with a single in the seven-run second inning.

Another freshman, Joseph DiCecilia, also drove in six runs, three in each game.

Junior Christian Conti continued his hot hitting, going 5-for-7 in the two games with his fifth triple of the season. Through eight games, Conti is hitting .536.

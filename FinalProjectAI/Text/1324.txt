Parents' Council
Members of the Parents' Council are invited annually by the president for a one-year, renewable term. They represent Muhlenberg families and are asked to share their perspectives and questions on College matters with the administration.
Members are expected to attend at least one of two meetings each year (during Family Weekend and a weekend in March/April), to become familiar with official College communicatons and to review information communicated by the Parents' Council chairs. Attendance at a fall reception and a spring dinner, hosted by the president, is appreciated.
Advocacy can extend beyond membership requirements as members of a network that serves the Career Center and/or as peer resources for newer parents during events such as Orientation, Move-in Day and Family Weekend.
Members are expected to make an annual gift before December of each year. Many also lend philanthropic support to programming and capital projects in addition to their annual contributions based on their interests and current needs.
For more information, contact Louis Diez, executive director of annual giving, at 484-781-2332 or louisdiez@muhlenberg.edu.

Muhlenberg’s losing streak reached six with a 9-5 home loss to Ursinus.

The Mules (9-17-1, 3-6) took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the first when senior Edward Risener blasted his third home run of the season. They led 4-2 after four, but the Bears (14-8-1, 6-3) scored twice in the fifth and twice in the sixth to go ahead, then added three insurance runs in the eighth.

Men’s Golf



Despite improving its score on the second day, Muhlenberg fell in the standings and finished Mid-Atlantic Regional in eighth place, one stroke behind Franklin & Marshall. Sophomore Zachary Oyer was one of 16 golfers in the field of 75 to shoot in the 70s in both rounds.

A big last-inning rally and three school records highlighted the Muhlenberg softball team’s doubleheader split at Swarthmore.

The Mules won the first game, 9-3, and dropped the second game, 5-4. The Garnet has qualified for the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last three years.

In the opening game, 



The Mules’ all-time leader in home runs and RBI, Ferrigno needs two doubles to add that category to the list.



the Mules (14-11, 8-2) let up two unearned runs in the bottom of the sixth and were two outs from defeat before rallying to score eight runs in the top of the seventh. Sophomore Alyssa Epstein began the rally with a one-out pinch-single, and sophomore Jess Kasza followed with her second double of the game.

Freshman Shelby Smith drove in the first run of the inning with a single, and after an intentional walk, senior RiRi Ferrigno brought in the tying run with an unintentional walk. Freshman Maggie Scarpelli singled to give Muhlenberg the lead, and senior Samantha Crist drew another bases-loaded walk to make it 5-3.

Four more runs scored on a single by junior Jenna Van Waalwijk, a forceout and two infield errors.

The game marked the second time in four days that the Mules came back from two runs behind to win in their final at-bat. Prior to Saturday’s first game against Washington, Muhlenberg hadn’t done that since a 2004 game against Dickinson.

Ferrigno became the Mules’ all-time leader with 84 career RBI when she hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning of the second game. It was her sixth career home run, tying the school record. 

Scarpelli and Van Waalwijk also went deep in the fourth, giving Muhlenberg a school-record three home runs in the game. Swarthmore (10-13, 1-5) broke a 4-4 tie in the bottom of the sixth, however, and held on to break the Mules’ eight-game winning streak.

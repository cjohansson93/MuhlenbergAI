Mission Statement
We will investigate, develop and promote sustainability in our research and curriculum, administrative and facilities operations, campus community and other communities to which we belong, as well as in our individual behavior. We define sustainability as meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Vision Statement
We are committed to being good citizens of the Earth, and to making institutional decisions that are mindful of our complex relations with the ecosystem. We seek to minimize our resource use and to be good stewards of the natural resources entrusted to us. We seek to create ways to positively impact our environment. As an institution of higher learning, we seek to create a culture on campus that supports sustainability.
Values Statement
We believe that our individual and institutional actions can have a significant impact on our local, regional and global environment.
We believe that integrating sustainability into the educational experience is vital to preparing students for lives of leadership and service as responsible global citizens.
We believe that it is our responsibility as individuals and as a college to model environmentally sustainable practices, both within the campus community and beyond it.
We believe that good environmental stewardship is best realized through collaboration, when the diverse actors that make up a college are working together.
We believe that sustainability and good business go hand in hand, and that the ethical, scientific and economic dimensions of sustainability can and should be balanced.
We recognize that the notion of sustainability integrates economic growth and development with environmental protection and social justice, and we operate under that guiding principle.

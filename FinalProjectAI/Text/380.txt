Our Approach
Our goal in the Office of Financial Aid is to help as many students as possible afford a Muhlenberg education. We do this through a combination of need-based and merit-based loans, grants and scholarships. The average first-year financial aid offer from all sources is more than $42,200, and the average total first-year financial aid package (including all grants and scholarships, federal student loans and campus employment) is more than $40,000. We help students and families navigate the application process from start to finish. 
Why We Do It
We strive to educate and inspire the most talented and diverse student body we can. We know financial aid is an important factor in the college choices of many families.

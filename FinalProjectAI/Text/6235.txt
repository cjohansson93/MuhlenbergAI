Track Teams in Good Position After Day Two of CC Championships
 Saturday, May 5, 2012







					 


In addition to her javelin and shot put, junior Tara Keegan of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team had another tool that turned out to be just as important when she competed in the heptathlon at the Centennial Conference Championships.

With the sun shining for most of the two days of competition, Keegan spent most of her time between events huddled under an umbrella to try to beat the heat. 




Senior Andrew Henry was a part of the men’s 4x800 relay that finished sixth.





The tactic worked, and Keegan improved upon her personal best by almost 200 points, finishing third with a score of 3,866. She moved up a spot after sitting in fourth after the first day of competition to win her first career CC medal.

“It was a really competitive field, so it felt great to medal,” Keegan said of the highest Mule finish in the heptathlon since 2007. “Yesterday was really hot, and it was brutal just trying to get through it. But my stronger events were today, and I just wanted to improve.”

While Keegan’s performance gave the Mules a solid start to the day, the women’s 4x800 relay provided a fantastic finish.

The team of juniors Erica Bash and Samantha Mayden, sophomore Nicki Cronin and freshman Cassiah Sahl picked up the women’s team’s third medal of the championships, taking silver.

The time of 9:24.20 ranks second on the school’s performance list and was almost six seconds faster than the third-place time.




Bash posted the second-fastest time of the day (2:17.32) to move on to the finals in the 800.





Senior Michael Baer and sophomore Scott Reutter finished fifth and seventh, respectively, in the decathlon. Baer’s score of 5,236 ranks third on the school’s all-time performance list, while Reutter improved upon his personal best by more than 120 points.

Seniors Marc Brookland, William Lowrey and Jim Gamrat rounded out Muhlenberg’s day two placewinners. Brookland took fifth in the long jump, while Lowrey finished seventh in the steeplechase in a time of 9:48.97, the second-fastest in school history. Gamrat finished a personal-best sixth in the discus.

The rest of day two consisted primarily of preliminary trials, which the Mules took full advantage of, advancing 12 to tomorrow's finals.

Senior Peter Rice qualified for the finals in both the 200 and 400, and he will be joined in the 200 by classmate Kyle Sullivan and sophomore Isaiah Vaughn. Sullivan and Vaughn also both qualified for the 100-meter dash finals.

Senior David Kurtis and sophomore Jeffrey Phillips advanced to the finals in the 400 hurdles. Kurtis, one of just two competitors to break the 58-second mark, set a new personal best by more than .2 seconds.

On the women’s side, sophomore Stephanie Carnevale advanced to the finals in both the 100 and 100 hurdles. She’ll be joined in the hurdles by sophomore Amber Lee Wojtkowski. Freshman Kirsten Kuchera ran the fifth-best time on the Mule performance list (26.81) to advance in the 200.

The Mule men currently sit in fourth place in the team race, while the women are fifth. And according to Keegan, they are in prime position of achieving their goal of improving on their seventh-place finish at the indoor championships. 

“We had some really strong performances all around,” she said. “Everybody looked good and comfortable. We’re in great shape, now we just have to come out tomorrow and keep it going.”

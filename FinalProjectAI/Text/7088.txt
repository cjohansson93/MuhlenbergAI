The Muhlenberg volleyball and women’s soccer teams got their Centennial Conference seasons off to a flying start, each earning victories at McDaniel in their CC openers.



Volleyball’s sweep of the Green Terror was part of a 2-0 day in which the Mules (6-4) also posted a 3-0 win over Goucher. 
Sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller led the way in the McDaniel match, producing a team-high 10 kills and three blocks as Muhlenberg 
took the first two sets by a score of 25-15 before edging the Green Terror, 25-23, in the third. 

Sophomore Joanne Josephson turned in a solid all-around performance with nine kills in only 13 attempts, three digs and three blocks 
in the CC opener, while sophomore Katherine Boll (six kills, four aces, two blocks), 
freshman Allison Glass (six kills, two aces, five digs) and sophomore co-captain Chelsea Kaser 
(team-high 15 digs) also played well.




Tied at 23 in the third set, Josephson’s kill gave the Mules a match point, and sophomore Erin Murphy came up with a block to seal the victory. 


The passing of sophomore Vanessa Pulice and junior Nikki Dickson (23 combined assists) enabled Muhlenberg to hit an astounding .326,
with only eight attack errors.

Glass (left) had 12 kills, four aces, and nine digs against Goucher.

Women’s soccer, meanwhile, scored an early goal and held on for a 1-0 victory at McDaniel, the Mules’ third consecutive shutout.

Freshman Abby Lazofsky (right) netted her second career goal off a corner kick by senior co-captain Stephanie Tramutola in the 
20th minute, giving the Mules (3-2, 1-0) an early lead. That was all Muhlenberg would need, as sophomore goalie Jen Mermelstein 
(three saves for her first career shutout) and the rest of the Mule defense made sure the advantage held up. 

The Mules, who outshot McDaniel, 12-5, for the contest, avenged a 1-0 setback at the hands of the Green Terror in last season’s conference opener.
Since then, Muhlenberg has allowed only two goals in 10 CC matches.

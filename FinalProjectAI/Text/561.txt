In 1341, the great poet Francesco Petrarca became the first man to be crowned Poet Laureate in Rome since classical antiquity. With his revival of this ancient ceremony â the placement of a laurel crown (la corona d'alloro) on the head of a poet by the Roman Senate â Petrarca sought to raise the dignity of poets to that which they had enjoyed in ancient Rome. He began his acceptance speech by quoting the poet Virgil â sed me Parnasi deserta per ardua dolcis / raptat amor ("but over the lonely heights of Parnassus, a sweet love captivates me," Georgics, Book 3) â expressing the difficulty of the solitary labor required by academic pursuits coupled with the gratifying exhilaration of intellectual successes.
The Corona d'Alloro Prize in Italian Studies is awarded each year to the student who best demonstrates intellectual excellence in Italian Studies at Muhlenberg. The prize was inaugurated in 2015 thanks to a financial gift from a very generous anonymous donor interested in promoting Italian Studies at Muhlenberg College.
 

 
2021

Alexander Mast '21 is the winner of of the 2021 Corona d'Alloro Prize in Italian Studies.  Alex is a Music Major and Italian Studies Minor. Arriving at Muhlenberg as a sophomore transfer with two semesters of French on his transcript, Alex decided to shift his gaze south to the sunny climes of il bel paese: a fateful decision.  Immediately following his first Italian class, ears still ringing with mellifluous Italian vocabulary, lyrical sentences, and dreaming of stones filled with stories amongst the streets of Italyâs most beautiful cities, Alex was confident that his migration to Italy was the right decision.  Before he knew it, Alex was committing the Italian Studies Minor to compliment his major in Music. Italian Studies minorled Alex to study abroad  in Florence, where his stories became a part of those stones he heard about in class back in Allentown. Senior year, he successfully launched a project as president of the Italian Club entitled La Passeggiata, a weekly newsletter meant to engage with the clubâs audience and provide a weekly dose of the magic that Italian students experience at Muhlenberg every day in class.
 The following are Alex's reflections on studying Italian at Muhlenberg.

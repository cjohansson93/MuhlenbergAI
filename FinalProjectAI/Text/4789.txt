 Womens tennis honors



number eight is great for faust



In 2011, for the first time in five years, the Centennial Conference womens pole vault title will be up for grabs.

Muhlenberg senior Alex Faust completed a clean career sweep of the vault by winning for the eighth straight time on the first day of the 2010 CC Outdoor Track and Field Championships, hosted by Swarthmore. She is the first Mule athlete to win an event all four years both indoors and outdoors.

And Faust did it in style. Her winning height of 12 feet, 8¾ inches broke the

school, CC, meet and venue records and qualified her automatically for the NCAA Championships. As of the start of the meet, only two women in Division III had cleared that height this season. The automatic qualifying standard is 12-8.

Faust won the gold medal with first successful vault, as her starting height, 10-11, was the height that the silver and bronze medalists failed to clear. She cleared 11-5 and 12-0 on her first tries, but needed her third and final try to make 12-4. From there Faust went on to her record vault before missing three times at 13-0.

The pole vault was one of two championship finals on the first day of the three-day meet, and the Muhlenberg women scored in both of them. Senior Jayne Condon (left), running the 10,000 meters for the first time in her career, finished fifth with a time of 38:02.49  the second-fastest in program history.

Freshman Ryan Hellings scored a point for the mens team by finishing eighth in the pole vault. Sophomore Michael Baer was fifth after the first half of the decathlon.

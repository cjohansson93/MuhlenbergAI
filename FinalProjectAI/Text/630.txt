Links Student Projects High Energy Particle & Nuclear Physics
Background Ph.D. - Physics / Iowa State Univeristy B.A. - Physics / Grinnell College
I have always loved teaching, and I hope to deepen the ties between the nuclear physics research community and the liberal arts environment here at Muhlenberg. I currently study high energy collisions between the nuclei of atoms. The premier experiments in this field are being performed with the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) located at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island.
This summer, I am working with four students at Brookhaven National Laboratory to assist in the construction of a factory that will assemble and test high energy particle physics detectors based on resistive plate chamber (RPC) technology.The conditions created at RHIC are similar to those that are believed to have existed several millionths of a second after the Big Bang, so this research has important implications for cosmological models.
I was educated first at Grinnell College, and then at Iowa State University. Before that, I lived in New York City where I was an actor for eight years. I grew up in New Jersey, and enjoyed astronomy, acting, and violin when I was a kid.
I currently live with my wife Sara, our daughter Sophia, and our son David. I also have a daughter, Laura, who lives in Rhode Island.

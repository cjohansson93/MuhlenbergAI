Men's Lacrosse Leaps Back into Win Column
 Wednesday, February 29, 2012 - page 2







					 





Rheiner has scored 10 goals in three games this season, just one fewer than he netted all of last year.



February 29 is a day that comes along only once every four years. But what juniors Doug Rheiner and Jack Reilly did for the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team on Leap Day is even less frequent.

Rheiner scored a career-high five goals and Reilly recorded four assists to lead the Mules to a 9-7 win at Susquehanna in their first road game of the season. It’s the first time in the modern history of the program that Muhlenberg has had five-goal and four-assist performances in the same game.

Reilly’s four helpers, three of which came on Rheiner goals, were one short of the school record and helped the Mules (2-1) bounce back from their first loss of the season.

Muhlenberg trailed 3-1 before reeling off five straight goals in the second and third quarters. Two of the goals came in man-up situations, including one by junior AJ Diaz to close out the run.

The Crusaders (0-2) came back to score the next two goals to close to within one, but another man-up goal by Diaz, with 30 seconds left in the third quarter, put the Mules up 7-5.

Susquehanna scored off the fourth-quarter faceoff to cut the gap to one again but never took a shot with a chance to tie. Rheiner scored off passes from Reilly and Diaz in the fourth quarter to give the Mules some breathing room.

Diaz matched his career total entering the game by scoring four points on two goals and a pair of assists. Junior James Fasola made 10 saves, and junior Ian Jones had another strong game in the X, winning 12 of 19 faceoffs.

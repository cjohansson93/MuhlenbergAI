Call Me By Any Other Nameâ¦ Just as Sweet
A World Premiere Queer Deconstruction of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet
Oct. 21â24, 2021
Adapted & Directed by Nigel Semajwith new text by Jack Saleeby & Brayden Stallman
 This explorative new adaptation steps outside of how we have typically viewed and experienced the story of Romeo and Juliet. By using inspirations from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, Call Me By Any Other Nameâ¦ Just As Sweet examines the role of fate and who gets to love, while reimagining the narrative and staking a claim for Queer storytelling.
Content Notice: This show includes depictions of violence and self-harm.

Field Hockey Breezes to 10th Win

Three seniors on the Muhlenberg field hockey team just couldn’t wait to celebrate Senior Night.

Lauren Jordan notched her first career hat trick, Kayleigh Thies tied a school record
with three assists and Meghan Gill nearly doubled her previous career total with six points as the
Mules rolled to a 9-1 home victory against Swarthmore.

The win left Muhlenberg, which will hold its Senior Night for real on Friday, in sole possession of third place (tied in the loss column with two other teams) in the Centennial
Conference with two league games remaining. The Mules (10-3, 6-2) reached double digits in wins for the first time in seven
years and the 13th time in program history.

Since the CC went to a five-team playoff field in 2004, no team with six wins has failed to earn a berth.

Another senior, Christine Germaske, contributed a goal and an assist as Muhlenberg scored its most goals
since a 10-1 win vs. Bryn Mawr in 2007.

The game was little more than a minute old when Thies put in a rebound of her saved shot to start the scoring. At 70 seconds,
it was the second-fastest goal for the Mules this season. Jordan deflected in two hits by Thies to make it 3-0 a shade more than nine
minutes into the game.

Jordan completed her first career hat trick – the second by a Mule this season – just 1:06 into the second half.
Thies’ record-tying third assist came on the first goal of the season by Gill (right), who finished with two goals and two assists
after entering the game with career totals of three goals and two assists.

Freshman Gwen Remaley and sophomore Rachel Strow also scored goals, and freshman
Alexandria DeAngelo netted her first career point with an assist.

Mens golf clinches Matte Award at Lehigh Valley Cup


Even strong winds could not blow the Muhlenberg mens golf team off course in its bid to secure the Matte Award at the Lehigh Valley Cup. 

Of course a little help from Moravian made the task a whole lot easier.

The Mules shot 413 to finish third behind a pair of Division I teams  Lafayette and Lehigh. The Greyhounds, meanwhile, did not register a team score, meaning the Matte Award stays in Allentown for the seventh consecutive year.
 


Named for the late Aaron Matte (Muhlenberg 70), a strong supporter of local college athletics, the award goes to the school with the better record in head-to-head regular-season competition in all sports. 

It was unfortunate that they werent able to have a team score, senior Eric Boskey said. But we posted some pretty good scores, so Im confident that we couldve won even if they had had five players. Its a really cool feeling to be the team that clinched the award, especially with it being my senior year.

Teams were allowed to enter to seven players to the tournament, which was played at the par-72 Grace Course at Saucon Valley Country Club, with the five lowest scores counting towards the team total. Moravian only sent four golfers, so the Greyhounds were not able to record a team score.

Even so, Muhlenbergs top four scores still beat Moravians top four scores by five strokes. The Mules also beat the Greyhounds by a stroke at their own Moravian Spring Invitational on the last day of March.

On a day when winds gusted in excess of 20 miles per hour, pins were hard to get close to and fairways were difficult to find, according to Boskey.

It was a tough day to go low, he said. But thats golf. The conditions are not always going to be perfect, so youve got to just suck it up and battle through it. And I think we did a pretty good job of that today. We didnt get too frustrated, and we played within ourselves.

Junior Matthew Cohen led the Mules with a 79. He finished tied for eighth and was the only non-Division I player to break 80.

Boskey carded an 82, while seniors Zachary Oyer and Jordan Carpenter, and sophomore Brandon Davis (left) each posted 84s to round out the Mule scorers.

It was good to be able to get out and compete in some tough conditions, Boskey said. Of course we'd love to be playing in 80-degree temperatures with no wind, but with the way the weather has been lately, theres no telling what it will be like at the conference championships. So this was a good test to see how we can play in strong winds.

And of course it always feels great to beat Moravian, especially when the Matte Award is on the line.

Softball Returns to Action with Historic Win

Fifteen days is a long time to wait, but it isn’t nearly as long as 24 years.


In its first game since wrapping up a 7-1 Spring Break trip to Florida on March 5, the Muhlenberg softball posted a landmark win, defeating The College of
New Jersey, 6-0, in the first game of its home-opening doubleheader. It was the first win ever for the Mules against the six-time national champion Lions;
in a series that began in 1990 (a year before any current team member was born), they had come up short 41 straight times. TCNJ came back to win the second
game of the twinbill by the same 6-0 score.

Muhlenberg (8-2) eliminated the biggest zero on its list of series records thanks to Kelsey Jones  putting up zero after zero. The junior
pitched a four-hitter for her eighth career shutout, striking out four. Jones allowed only one runner past second base, on a two-out triple in the third,
and did not allow two baserunners in the same inning until the seventh.

Senior Kelly Kline gave the Mules all the runs they would need by lining a ball over the fence in right field for a two-run homer in the bottom
of the third. It was career home run No. 25 for the player who wears No. 25.

Kline was a tablesetter when Muhlenberg put the game away with four runs in the sixth. After getting hit by pitch to lead off the inning, she went to third
on a double by sophomore Taylor Trifiolis and came around to score on a pinch-single by sophomore Amie DeFeo (left).

RBI hits by junior Jaimie Klotz and sophomore Nicole Iannanrone, sandwiched around a run-scoring groundout by sophomore
Alexis Giovinazzo, capped the four-run outburst.

The bats were quieted in the second game, and the Lions (5-9) sent 11 batters to the plate to score all six of their runs in the top of the fifth. Trifiolis hit
another double for her fourth straight game with a two-bagger.

Muhlenberg College Mourns the Loss of Dylan Domenick '13


	 Sunday, November 10, 2013  04:01 PM

To Members of the Muhlenberg Community,
We are sad to share the news that Dylan Domenick '13, died Friday at his apartment near campus. No cause of death has been reported. We hope you will join us in offering support and prayers for Dylan's friends and family. President Helm has spoken with Dylan's father and offered condolences on behalf of our community. We also urge Dylan's friends to seek counsel and comfort from our Chaplains or our Counseling Center.
If you would like to speak with a counselor today (Sunday) or after-hours this week, you can reach the on-call counselor by calling Campus Safety at 484-664-3112. Counselors will also be available in the Counseling Services office during the day tomorrow and throughout the week at 484-664-3178.
If you would like to speak with a Chaplain, call 484-664-3120 or cisabelle@muhlenberg.edu.
The College community is invited to a vigil tomorrow (Monday, November 11) at 8:00 p.m. in Egner Chapel. This simple gathering will include a chance to share memories, light a candle and pray together as we remember Dylan. If you would like to be part of the planning of this vigil, please contact Chaplain Callista Isabelle at cisabelle@muhlenberg.edu.
Dylan's family will be having a funeral mass on Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. at St. James Church, 184 South Finley Avenue, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920. A repass will follow within the same church's facilities.
Sincerely,
Randy Helm, PresidentKaren Green, Dean of StudentsAnita Kelly, Director of Counseling ServicesCallista Isabelle, College Chaplain

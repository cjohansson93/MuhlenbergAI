Missions accomplished.

The Muhlenberg women’s cross country team came  into the Centennial Conference Championships with the intention of beating Gettysburg, a team ranked higher in the
region, and the men had the goal of improving their standing from a year ago. Both came through with flying colors.

The women came in fourth for the second year in a row, behind three teams ranked in the top 15 in Division III but ahead of Gettysburg. It matched the best finish in
program history. The men were fifth after two years of sixth-place finishes.

Appropriately, the margins were small, meaning that every runner and every place counted toward the team success. The women were six points ahead of Gettysburg, while
the men edged out Franklin & Marshall by two points.

For the women, who were just 22 points behind 15th-ranked Dickinson, senior Samantha Mayden (left) placed fifth overall and became the first woman and only the second Muhlenberg cross country runner ever to earn first-team all-conference twice. She was
sixth last year.

Joining her in the top 20 were junior Nicki Cronin in 18th and senior Erica Bash in 19th. During her career, Bash improved her place at the CC meet from 86th to 60th to 29th to 19th.

Freshman Melanie Tramontina came in 45th overall in her first career CC race, beating out the last two Gettysburg scorers. Junior Jackie Shulack, also competing in her first CC meet,
rounded out the top five.

Junior Charlie Kline (right) led the men by placing 31st overall. The men had a great pack as the top five runners (Kline, sophomore Luke Munyan, junior Bobby 
McGetrick, sophomore Kenny Wohl and senior Brendan Smith) were within 54 seconds of each other. Smith sealed the Mules’s fifth-place finish by coming in
29 seconds and four scoring places ahead of Franklin & Marshall’s fifth runner.

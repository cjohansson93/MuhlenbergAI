Travel writer Brandon A. Schultz â06, who was a psychology major and anthropology minor at Muhlenberg, worked in book publishing for seven years before going freelance in 2018. During that time, he wrote four books (including three pet-centric titles, like 2015âs Cooking for TwoâYour Cat & You! Delicious Recipes for You and Your Favorite Feline) and built a network that would eventually allow him to freelance full-time. His first magazine travel piece appeared in Out in 2014. Now, he travels 50 weeks out of the year, has a travel column on Forbes.com and contributes to more than a dozen other outlets. He authored three chapters of Fodor's Best Road Trips in the USA: 50 Epic Trips Across All 50 States, out this month. His first solo-authored travel book, 111 Places in Philadelphia That You Must Not Miss, publishes next summer.
Muhlenberg Magazine What has it been like to be a travel writer during the COVID-19 pandemic? 
BAS Oh dang, not ideal! Obviously, I had to stay home for a while, and that was a serious lifestyle change. I got to spend so much more time with my partner and my pets. That was a tremendous silver lining personally, but it definitely required a dramatic change in content professionally. I wrote loads of travel-related product guides for those five months that I was completely grounded and then transitioned to road-trip stories when domestic travel opened up slightly in late summer of 2020.
MM Whatâs the most challenging part of your career? 
BAS Freelancing is a constant hustle. As a new friend recently said to me, we wake up unemployed every day until we find someone to hire us. Thatâs frightening to a lot of people. And, while I know everyone says they are tired all the time, itâs extremely exhausting being in new places at least weekly, and often a couple times per week, changing time zones regularly, catching a few hours of sleep on a plane when possible and never knowing what day or, sometimes, what month it is.
MM Whatâs the most enjoyable part? 
BAS Seeing the world for free is amazing. Before my study abroad year in Rome through Muhlenberg, I had never left the country. My family never took vacations and we didnât have a lot of money, so travel just wasnât part of my life, though I always wished it were. I still canât believe that I get to do it almost every day now.

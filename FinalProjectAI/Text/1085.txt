Weekly Community Update from President Harring
Tuesday, May 12, 2020

Dear students, faculty and staff,
I am happy to share news with you about a series of programs we are calling the Muhlenberg College Red Door Initiatives. These programs are designed to help support our students through the COVID-19 period by providing funding and opportunities to those most in need. The first programs were rolled out over the past two weeks and include the summer Muhlenberg Extended Learning (MXL) program and the COVID-19 Emergency Grant program.


MXL provides funds for up to 100 returning and 100 first-year students to apply for a grant to take one online summer course for free. First-year students can also opt to take their Personal and Professional Development course to get a head start on their studies. Following the announcement of this program, we received a large volume of applications. Thanks to the great work of our provost, admissions and financial aid offices most of these applications have been reviewed and many of the grants have been awarded.




Additional Red Door Initiatives include the disbursement of CARES Act fundingâstudents received notice via email yesterdayâand the expansion of the Collegeâs COVID-19 Emergency Student Grant program. For more information about these programs, please go to the Red Doors Initiatives page on our website.


Our Career Center, in partnership with the Office of Alumni Affairs, is also working to provide internship opportunities for our students both on and off campus. If you are an alum or a parent and can provide an opportunity for one of our students, please contact the Career Center at careers@muhlenberg.edu.
Last week, following guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Office of Housing & Residence Life shared the process with students for the retrieval of their belongings from campus residences. The process will follow the necessary precautions to maintain the health and safety of all involved. Please go to the Student Resources section of the Muhlenberg COVID-19 Information webpage for all of the details.
Finally, I just want to share again the dates and timing concerning a couple of year-end events.


Our Virtual Senior Days will take place from May 13-17 and will include a pub night, Last Lecture, cap decorating, my year-end address and a class toast. There will also be plenty of opportunities to share the experience on social media as well.




On-campus commencement activities have been scheduled for October 18 and 19. We are currently reviewing the suggestions from seniors regarding the activities to hold and will share information at a later date.


Once again, I invite you send me your general questions about how Muhlenberg is moving forward in these unusual times to presquestions@muhlenberg.edu so that I can answer via video in my next messageâhere is this weekâs video update:

Please remember that when we review the questions you send, we look for themes so I can try and provide answers to some of the questions that many of you raise. If you have specific questions for a College office, please contact that office for a more detailed answer. Contact information for relevant offices can be found on the College website.
I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy.
Sincerely,Kathy HarringInterim President

 Georges Rouault     (French, 1871-1958) C’est par ses meurtrissures quenous sommes gueris, 1922 Engraving
 During World War I, Rouault began collecting material for his greatest and most moving series of prints, the Miserere, commissioned by the art dealer, Ambrose Vollard. Rouault began the project in 1916 and did not finish until 1948 when the series of prints was published in 450 sets.
In the text accompanying the suite of plates for the Miserere series, Anthony Blunt wrote “whatever one’s belief, one cannot but be impressed and moved by the intensity of his emotion, and by the conviction with which he conveyed it through his works.” Blunt is describing the work of Georges Rouault, the Expressionist painter from France. The statement specifically refers to Rouault’s work depicting Christ from the Miserere series entitled, C’est par ses meurtrissures que nous sommes gueris.

Women's Basketball Goes Back-to-Back, Moves Up in Standings
 Wednesday, February 6, 2013 - page 2







					 





Sophomore Emily Lesher had four points, five rebounds and two steals.


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team had less than 24 hours between last night’s tipoff against Dickinson and tonight’s game at Bryn Mawr.

And like the short span between their two games, the Mules, led by senior Alita Zabrecky, wasted little time jumping ahead of the Owls en route to a 77-43 victory for their second win in two days.

The victory, combined with losses by Johns Hopkins (to McDaniel) and Haverford (to Ursinus), moved Muhlenberg (14-8, 11-6) from fifth place to third place in the Centennial Conference with three games remaining in the regular season. The Mules can clinch a playoff berth with a win in one of those games.

Zabrecky scored all eight of Muhlenberg’s points in the first 3:28 of play. She finished with 10 points and three steals, and now ranks seventh on Muhlenberg’s all-time list with 184 career steals.

The Mules forced turnovers on 10 consecutive possessions and tallied seven steals in just under four minutes at the beginning of the game. They would force 35 turnovers by the end of the night. 

Muhlenberg grabbed its first double-digit lead with 13:15 until the halftime break and extended this lead to 23 less than eight minutes later. They led 39-18 at the conclusion of the first half.

Senior Kate Clawson netted a team-high 13 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the field and has averaged 12.8 points per game over the past four games. She also added a career-high four steals.

Sophomore Abby Stenger also hit a career mark with her four steals.

All but one Muhlenberg player scored at least two points. Junior Katy Mitton and freshman Christina Santone each netted nine. Santone also grabbed four rebounds, three of them offensive, and blocked three shots.

The Mules held a huge 26-14 advantage over the Owls (1-20, 0-17) on the offensive glass.

Sophomore Hannah Rush dished out six assists, and junior Colleen Caldwell added four. The duo combined for only one turnover.

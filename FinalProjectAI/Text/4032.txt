men’s golf grabs early lead


While many golf enthusiasts sat in front of their televisions to watch the dramatics from Augusta on the final day of The Masters, the members of the
Muhlenberg golf teams took to the links themselves.

The Mule men's players were masters of the course at the Glenmaura National Collegiate Invitational, taking the lead after the first of two rounds.
Muhlenberg shot a 303 - two strokes better than host Scranton - to match its lowest score of the year.

All five Mules shot in the 70s, led by senior Zachary Oyer with a 74, three strokes off the lead. Junior Zack Meyers and freshman
Chris DiMaio both carded a 76.

The women's golf team had its first competition of the year, the Gettysburg Spring Invitational. Senior Amy Venuto, the lone
Mule to compete, shot a 105 to finish 14th.

Cano Wins Discus Gold to Lead Track at CC Championships
 Saturday, May 3, 2014 - page 2







					 



Daniel Cano won a gold medal in the discus to lead the Muhlenberg track and field teams in the second day of the Centennial Conference Championships.


Cano’s throw of 139-1 was a little more than half a foot better than the closest competitor, giving the sophomore his second career medal at the conference meet. Cano, who finished fourth in the discus a year ago and second in the shot put indoors, became the first Mule ever to win gold in the event.

With one day of competition remaining, the Mule women sit in fifth place, just two points behind Gettysburg and six back of third-place Swarthmore. The men reside in fourth.



Freshman Michelle Gaykowski was one of three Muhlenberg women to place in the discus, pacing the trio with a fourth-place finish and an ECAC-qualifying throw. The rookie’s mark of 118-11 landed her in third on the program’s all-time performance list. Sophomore Jessica Thimmel and junior Cora Wallace placed seventh and eighth, respectively.

Senior Scott Reutter won the long jump portion of the decathlon en route to a sixth-place showing. Sophomore Ashley Riley (left) was fifth in the long jump after an eighth-place finish at the indoor championship meet.

Freshman Jaryd Flank captured his first CC place with an eighth-place performance in the steeplechase, and sophomore Michael Schwarz took seventh in the long jump.

The Mules also put themselves in position to pick up more points on the meet’s final day with solid performances in qualifying heats.  

Senior Lauren Zakheim was one of the stars of the day, finishing fifth in prelims with an 800-meter time good for fifth all-time at Muhlenberg. 

Sophomore James Knight (110-meter hurdles) and junior Cody Geyer (100-meter dash) also earned spots in Sunday’s finals, as did senior Jeffrey Phillips (right), who was eighth in the 400-meter hurdles prelims.

Cross Country Teams Successful Long and Short

The Muhlenberg cross country teams hope to be successful in the long run, when they compete at the NCAA Mideast Regional in November. At the site of that important meet, the
Mules were successful in the short run as well.


The women finished second and the men took third place at the Dickinson Long-Short Invitational. It was the highest finish ever for both programs at the meet.

The women (left, with their second-place plaque) finished behind Dickinson, which is ranked second in the region and 12th in Division III. Muhlenberg is ranked seventh in the region. 

The two other teams at the meet ranked higher in the region, Haverford and Elizabethtown, did not enter a full complement of runners in both races. 
Schools had to run at least three runners in each of the long and short runs to qualify for the combined team score.

Mule women finished second in both races. Senior Samantha Mayden came in second in a field of 213 runners in the 6K, while junior Nicki Cronin, competing for the first time this season, was the runner-up in the 4K.

 Senior Brendan Smith finished 10th in the men’s 4K. Junior Charlie Kline (right) was the first Muhlenberg runner across the finish line in the 8K, in 40th place overall.

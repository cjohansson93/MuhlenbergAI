Field Hockey Wins in OT on Senior Night
 Friday, October 24, 2014







					 



There were two big reasons why Alexandria DeAngelo was eager for a win when the Muhlenberg field hockey 
team hosted Gettysburg.

For one, the reserve freshman forward grew up in Gettysburg, and her Gettysburg High School team would attend the college
games, even playing the first game of high school-college doubleheaders a few times.



More importantly, DeAngelo and her Mule teammates wanted to win for their nine seniors on Senior Night.

Their wishes were satisfied on all counts when senior Kayleigh Thies scored with 2:42 left in the first overtime
for a thrilling 1-0 victory.

The win moves the Mules (11-3, 7-2) closer to a spot in the Centennial Conference playoffs. They will clinch a berth
for sure tomorrow unless Dickinson and Washington both manage to win on the road against Ursinus and Franklin & Marshall, 
respectively, both of which are ranked in the top 10 in Division III.

Muhlenberg’s second win in three nights didn’t come easily against the Bullets (4-10, 2-6), whose only wins in 
the previous nine games came against two teams that are winless in the CC.

Gettysburg took the first two shots of the game, both in the first nine minutes, and did not take another one for the
remainder of regulation. The Mules dominated the play, particularly in the second half when they took 17 shots,
but could not score a goal.

Overtime was more evenly played, with both teams getting excellent chances. Senior Sierra Lenker stopped consecutive shots
on her pads midway through the period, and shortly after that each team missed a golden opportunity when a cross to an
open player at the post was just a shade off.


“It was so intense,” said DeAngelo, who played a good chunk of the overtime. “It was very back and
forth; we kept going from offense to defense and back. Everyone was working their butts off. 
Our energy was up and we really wanted it.

“When Kay scored that goal, it was an amazing feeling.”

The goal – the fourth overtime winner of Thies’ career, one in each year – was set up when Thies saved a
ball from going over the endline. She played it back out and Muhlenberg passed it around before sophomore Emily Boyle
received a pass inside the circle. She dribbled through a pair of Gettysburg defenders, then passed off to Thies for a 
reverse sweep that made the Mules 3-0 in overtime games this season.

The goal gave Thies 99 career points and ensured that Senior Night will long live on in her memories and those of her
classmates – Allie Califano (who scored a dramatic winning goal in the last 30 seconds of 
regulation against Gettysburg last year), Ray Gallagher (left), Christine Germaske, Meghan Gill, Lauren Jordan,
Lenker, Heather Porrini and Samantha Swire.

“They are huge mentors, all of them,” said DeAngelo of the seniors. “They’ve helped me so much
tranistioning from high school to college. They’ve been so welcoming and have made my college experience so much
better. I’m going to miss them so much next year.”

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team went as cold as the weather in the second half and lost at Swarthmore, 10-5.

The Mules (1-7, 0-2) cut a 6-3 deficit to one by scoring the last two goals of the first half on a chilly, windy night. But Muhlenberg would not find the back
of the net again, coming up empty on all 13 of its second-half shots.

Junior Jason
Mertz scored two goals and assisted on two extra-man tallies for his third consecutive multiple-assist game. His season total of
17 assists is tied for the fourth-highest in team history. 

Junior Michael Heenan (left), sophomore
Steven Casella and freshman Brad D’Alessandro neeted a goal apiece. (corrected 3/27)

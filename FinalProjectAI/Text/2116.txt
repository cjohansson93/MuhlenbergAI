Summer Research Poster Session
Every fall, the summer research students from the Biology, Chemistry, Math, Physics, and Psychology Departments participate in the Summer Research Poster Session. This event provides an opportunity for the students to present and discuss their research as they would at a scientific conference.  Typically, there are 30 to 45 student presenters.  The entire campus community and the presentersâ families are invited to attend this event.

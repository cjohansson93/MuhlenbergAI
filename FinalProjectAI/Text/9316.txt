The Muhlenberg College Department of Theatre and Dance presents “Dance Emerge,” an intimate dance concert presenting the new works of rising student choreographers, April 22-25 in the college’s Trexler Pavilion for Theatre and Dance.
Under the artistic direction of Corrie Franz Cowart, lecturer in dance at Muhlenberg, dance students will premiere original works of “vigor and fresh perspectives,” Cowart says. Each dance presents a unique movement statement, displaying a wide array of movement styles and ideas and represent the culmination of a semester-long choreographic process. “This concert presents a vastly diverse offering,” Cowart says, “from innovative interactions with props, to dynamic hip hop, to modern day morality tales, to humorous forays into what it means to be a woman. These students combine choreographic skill with an enthusiasm for the subjects they explore. It’s an enthusiasm that is embodied by the performers, and I think the audience will be able to feel that.” The student choreographers draw from deeply personal life experiences in creating their pieces — as well as from their diverse liberal arts education, finding inspiration from a wide range of disciplines.  “If you have an interest in what’s important to college students today, this concert puts those issues front and center in an energetic, physical and highly creative way,” Cowart says.
“Dance Emerge” reflects the unique dynamic of the Muhlenberg College Dance program, among the highest-ranked programs of its kind in the country. The Fiske Guide to Colleges names both the theater and dance programs among the top small college programs in the United States; Muhlenberg is one of only eight colleges to be listed for both theater and dance. Senior Aubrey Kupstas ’10 builds upon her previous choreographic explorations into gender roles in our society with a new work that explicitly investigates “societal baggage” — more than 20 bags and suitcases playing a pivotal role in the performance. Maggie Griffin ’11 delves into the state of women’s preventive health care and the social inequalities in our current system. Lynn Lisella ’11 and her cast of three males and three females utilize dynamic partnering to challenge traditional roles of support and strength. In his piece “Tempted … Are You?” Kadeem Alston-Roman ’12 and his cast of 13 dancers explore how the seven deadly sins can control and manipulate people in the blink of an eye. Jeremy Arnold ’12 puts authority figures to the test in a hip hop piece for fourteen dancers. “Dance Emerge” also showcases the works of AlexJo Natale ’12, Krista Bacchieri ’12, Laura Baehr ’12, Emily Daly ’10, Katie Fierro ’11 and Ashley Sleeth ’11. 
Artistic Director Corrie Franz Cowart is an active performer, choreographer, independent filmmaker and dance educator. “Dance Emerge” performances are Thursday and Friday, April 22-23, at 8 p.m.; Saturday, April 24, at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sunday, April 25, at 2 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for youth. Performances are in the Dance Studio Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre and Dance, Muhlenberg College, 2400 Chew Street, Allentown. Call 484-664-3333, Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. for ticket reservations, or online at www.muhlenberg.edu/tickets.

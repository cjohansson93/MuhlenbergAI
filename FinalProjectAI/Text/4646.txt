lots of love for tennis teams



Six-love was a popular score as both Muhlenberg tennis teams picked up road wins.

The women extended their winning streak to three and moved to 2-0 in the Centennial Conference with a 6-3 victory at Ursinus. The men scored their second straight shutout win, 9-0 at Arcadia in a non-CC match.

Of the 10 singles wins recorded by the Mules in the two matches, four included at least one 6-0 set.

The leader in love was sophomore Jordan Ruttof the mens team, who rolled 



past his No. 1 singles opponent 6-0, 6-0. With his normal doubles partner out, Rutt also teamed up with classmate Michael Robbins (right) for an 8-4 No. 1 doubles win.

Junior Robbie Goldwein (No. 2) and senior Mark Apostolos (No. 5) each dropped only game in their singles wins, and at No. 6 freshman Ari Nutovits won his second set 6-0 after going to a tiebreak in his first. 

Winning 6-0 for the womens team were junior Sara Sutker at No. 2 in the first set and junior Danielle Winston at No. 3 in the second set. Muhlenbergs other two singles victors, juniors Caitie Druker (No. 1) and Lindsay Schmidt (No. 4), each won a set 6-1.

Druker (left) and Sutker made history when they breezed to an 8-1 win at No. 1 doubles. That gave them 22 career wins together in spring dual matches, breaking the school record of 21 set by Kerri Waldowski and Marissa Lutzer from 1998 to 2001. 

Hot on the heels of the Mules new all-time winningest doubles team is the duo of Winston and Schmidt, who tied the old mark with their 21st win together.

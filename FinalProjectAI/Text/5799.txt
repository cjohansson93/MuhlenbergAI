best possible ending forwomen’s soccer seniors




Senior Day truly belonged to the seniors in the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team’s 1-0 win over playoff-bound Gettysburg. 

Senior Megan Francis scored the game’s only goal in the 51st minute off of a centering pass from senior Maura Hendsey. Sophomore Kimberly Hacker also 
assisted on the play. 

“It’s really gratifying to score a goal in my final game, and it means so much that my fellow senior Maura assisted,” Francis said. “It was a collective effort; 
I was able to just poke the ball into 



Sophomore center back Samantha Hoffman and the Mule defense record six shutouts in 2007. 




the net.” 

After the goal, the Mules (8-6-3, 5-4-1 CC) seized control of what had been an evenly played game. Muhlenberg held a 13-1 edge in second-half shots and hit the crossbar 
twice after Francis’ goal on shots by Kasey and Kimberly Hacker. Sophomore goalkeeper Kate Morrissey made three saves to finish her first as the starter
the same way she began it, with a shutout. 

In a perfect world for the Mules, this wouldn’t have been the last game of the year. Muhlenberg beat the fourth (Haverford) and fifth (Gettysburg) seeds in the 
Centennial Conference playoffs, with today’s win forcing the Bullets (7-10-1, 6-4) to play their first-round match on the road. But a loss to Franklin & Marshall and a 
tie with Dickinson kept the Mules out of the playoffs.

“We were playing for heart and soul,” said Francis. “It’s great that we were able to end the season with a win.” 

The victory clinched a winning record for Muhlenberg, the team’s 10th in the last 11 years, and was the 150th in the career of head coach Leslie Benintend.

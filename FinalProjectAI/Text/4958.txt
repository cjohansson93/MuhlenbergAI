The fall 2009 season for Division III ended officially on December 19 with the Stagg Bowl in football. The end of the season brings the final
NCAA statistical rankings, and the Muhlenberg fall teams ranked in the top 40 in the country in a slew of defensive categories.

Men’s soccer ranked 28th in Division III in shutout percentage, with eight in 17 games, and 40th in team
goals-against average (0.74). Junior all-region goalie Jason Daniels was 34th with his goals-against average of 0.70.

Field hockey was 16th in save percentage (.810) and 27th in goals-against average (1.46). Freshman Kristen Dornenburg,
who played every minute in goal for the Mules, was 22nd and 30th in the same categories, respectively.

The volleyball team ranked 26th in Division III with 19.02 digs per set. Senior Christina Cangelosi also was 26th
with her average of  5.87 digs per set en route to becoming the program’s all-time leader in digs.

Football has a long history of making the statistical leader board in defensive categories, and 2009 was no exception.
The Mules were 13th in total defense (256.7 yards per game), 19th in scoring defense (15.8  points per game) and 21st in rushing defense (85.4 yards
per game). Junior Michael Katz was the only Muhlenberg team or athlete to rank as one of the best in an offensive category; the kicker tied
for 19th in field goals per game (1.00).

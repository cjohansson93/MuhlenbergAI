Muhlenberg College has announced the following faculty awards, which were presented at the College’s Honors Convocation ceremony on April 17, 2005. 
The Robert C. Williams Faculty Award, presented annually to honor the scholarship and creative work of a junior faculty member, was given to Dr. James Peck, assistant professor of theatre, who joined the College’s faculty in 1999. Peck is an honors graduate of Carleton College and earned his M.F.A. in directing from the University of California at San Diego, as a well as a Ph.D. in performance studies at New York University. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Peck is also a frequent director of theatrical productions.
The Outstanding Faculty Advisor to First-Year Students was established in 1987 as testimony to the high value the College places on advising for incoming students. The recipient, chosen by nominations by students in first-year advising groups, is Dr. Sue Curry Jansen, professor of communication. Jansen received her undergraduate and graduate degrees from the State University of New York at Buffalo. She began teaching at Muhlenberg in 1985. Jansen’s accomplishments include more than 80 publications, including two books. Previously, Jansen has received the Williams Award in 1990 as well as the Class of 1932 Research Professorship in 1992.
The Class of 1932 Research Professorship provides an opportunity for a faculty member to pursue a year of full-time research. The professorship for 2005-2006 was awarded to Dr. Douglas Ovens, professor of music.
This award will allow Ovens time to develop a theoretical and artistic exploration of non-pitched percussion sounds. Ovens intends to explore ways to unite complex percussion, electronic and ambient sounds to create structures that are both compelling and beautiful.
The Donald B. Hoffman Research Fellowship is given to encourage scholarship, research, or creative activity that results in publication, performance or exhibition. The Hoffman Fellowship for 2005-2006 was awarded to Dr. Bruce Wightman, associate professor of biology. This award will allow Wightman time to develop a molecular genetic analysis of the nhr-67 gene of the Namtode C. elegans. His findings will ultimately lead to publication and will provide preliminary finding to ground future grant proposals as well as provide opportunities for students to participate in laboratory work.

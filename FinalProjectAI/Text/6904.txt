Baseball Comes Back Three Times, Walks Off with Win

Although a couple of important things – namely the weather and the winning rally – were different, the Muhlenberg baseball team picked up right where it left off in Florida in its northern opener.



Just like they did on Saturday against Penn State Behrend in Fort Pierce, the Mules posted a walkoff win against a team from Pennsylvania with postseason experience.

This one was against rival Moravian, 6-5 in 10 innings. The win pushes Muhlenberg’s lead in the Matte Award standings to 6½-4½ with five sports remaining. Two points will be up for grabs at the next Matte event, the Muhlenberg Invitational track and field meet on April 6.

In the Penn State Behrend game, the Mules (9-3) got seven straight singles to start a five-run bottom of the ninth. Against the Greyhounds (6-5), they got just one, a line single to right-center by sophomore Jimmy Cody, who wheeled around to third when the next batter, junior Nick Kennedy, hit a ball that went right through the legs of the shortstop.

An intentional walk to senior Joseph Vila loaded the bases with nobody out and brought up sophomore Nick Plinio. The designated hitter fell behind 0-2, then worked the count even before hitting a slow roller to the left side of the infield. The shortstop came in to backhand the ball and throw home, but he booted it as Cody scored with the winning run.

In a game that started with a light mix of rain and snow falling – a far cry from the ideal Florida weather – Muhlenberg rallied from behind three times. Cody (right) hit his fourth triple of the season in the middle of a two-run rally in the third that gave the Mules a 3-2 lead. Junior Brett Rosen had two two-out RBI hits, the second a double to deep center in the bottom of the sixth to tie the score at 4-4. 

After the Greyhounds scored the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth, Muhlenberg again struck with two outs in the bottom half of the inning. Sophomore Kurt Johnson singled to right, went to second on a walk and scored the tying run on a sharp single by senior John Muha, who went 2-for-5 for his fifth straight multiple-hit game.

Senior Ryan Rechten worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the top of the 10th to earn the win.

men’s tennis drops close finale



The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team finished up its season with a long, hotly contested match at Elizabethtown. The three-and-a-half hour marathon featured four three-set matches and four tiebreakers, with the Blue Jays prevailing, 5-4.

The Mules finished their season 5-9. Elizabethtown is 12-4 and the top seed for the Commonwealth Conference playoffs.

Trailing 2-1 after doubles and 3-1 after the first singles match was completed, Muhlenberg came back to tie the score with wins and fifth and sixth singles, with 
junior Wayne Mitchel (left) rebounding after dropping the first set to win at No. 5.

Elizabethtown won a three-set match at No. 2 to take a 4-3 lead. Muhlenberg tied it back up when sophomore Jordan Rutt prevailed in three sets against a player who won the No. 1 singles bracket at the Mule Classic back in September. Rutt won the No. 4 singles flight at the same tournament.

Rutt’s win made the No. 3 singles match the decisive one. Muhlenberg senior Matt Kral and Elizabethtown junior Bryan Metz split the first two sets, both of which went to tiebreakers. Metz eventually prevailed 6-3 in the third set, which included a short delay because of a dispute over a referee’s call.

With his win at No. 5, senior Mark Apostolos ended the year with a team-best 8-3 singles mark.

Women suffragists picket in front of the White House, 1917. Author unknown.
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification and adoption of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. And while the amendment itself is considered a landmark moment for the women's suffrage movement that started in the mid-nineteenth century, historians at Muhlenberg and around the nation are using the anniversary to complicate a popular narrative and to draw attention to marginalized individuals and groups that still seek equality.
âA Century of Struggle: Women's Rights Before and After Suffrageâ will bring together leading scholars on multicultural and majority women's rights, women's health, women's employment as well as historical and contemporary legislation that has impacted women.
"We are interested in exploring not just the significance of [the passage of the 19th Amendment] but also the lapses and inequities between that moment and now," says Cathy Ouellette, associate professor of history.
Jacki Antonovich, assistant professor of history, agrees. "We asked ourselves, 'How do you commemorate an event that is held as a great moment in history?' while also acknowledging the limitations of that act, which didnât affect many women of color, for example. Our idea for this speakersâ series is walking a line between commemoration and exploring the real story of history."
The program's concept was initiated by Muhlenberg students in the College's History Club, who sought out professors and mentors for help building a lecture series that explored issues affecting women, framed specifically around the 100th anniversary of suffrage in the United States. Faculty in history and public health and staff in administrative rolesâincluding Kathleen Harring, the College's first woman president, and Lin-Chi Wang, the College's associate dean of students and director of equity and Title IXâwill act as speakers for events throughout the series.
Event Schedule
All events will be held at 7 p.m. on the A-Level of Muhlenberg College's Trexler Library and will accompany an archival exhibit, "An Innovation Revisited: 170 Years of Women on Campus" in the Collegeâs Rare Books Room. The display will open January 23 and be accessible through April and will be curated by Susan Falciani Maldonado, special collections & archives librarian.
All events are free and open to the public.

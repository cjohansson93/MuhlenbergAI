Disclosure of Disability

Colleges and universities are required to provide students with appropriate academic accommodations, auxiliary aids and services that are necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal access and opportunity to participate in the school's facilities, programs, and activities. At the postsecondary level, it is the student's responsibility to disclose his/her diagnosed condition, to request reasonable accommodations and to follow established procedures for requesting those accommodations.
Students with diagnosed conditions that may rise to the level of a disability who will be requesting accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services are encouraged to identify these needs to the Office of Disability Services, as soon as possible, after their application to the College has been accepted and their decision to attend has been confirmed. Submission of current, detailed documentation of the studentâs diagnosed condition, along with the completed Disability Disclosure Document is required in order to initiate the disability determination process. Please consult the Disability Determination Process Checklist for a comprehensive overview of the required steps in the process. The Office of Disability Services website contains all appropriate information to guide you in this process.
After an interview with the student, the Office of Disability Services will review submitted documentation, including medical and/or educational evaluations, IEPs, â504â Plans, and supplemental materials along with the completed Disability Disclosure Document.
The student should print a copy of the Disability Determination Process Checklist and the Disability Disclosure Document and include the completed form with the submission of documentation.

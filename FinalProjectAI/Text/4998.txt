MEN’S BASKETBALL WINS SCOTTY WOOD CONSOLATION




 Women Fall in Championship 


The No. 10 Muhlenberg women’s basketball fell behind early and never recovered, losing to No. 5 Scranton 62-42 in the championship game of the Scotty Wood Tournament.

Scranton built an 11-2 lead in the early going, but a 9-2 run brought the Mules to within two. Muhlenberg got as close as 22-21 with under two minutes to play in the first period after an 8-0 run, but the Royals closed out the half on a 9-0 run to enter the break up 30-21.

Sophomore Alexandra Chili hit a layup and three-pointer to make the score 40-29 with 11:35 to play, but Scranton went on a 14-0 run, holding the Mules scoreless for nearly six minutes, to pull away.

Scranton is the only school other than Muhlenberg to win the Scotty Wood championship in the last seven years. The Royals also won it in 2007.

Chili led the Mules with 11 points, and junior Sheila Cook pitched in nine points and five rebounds. Both were named to the all-tournament team.

Last Saturday, several members of the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team worked the Moravian-Muhlenberg football game as the chain gang.

A week later, the Mules went to work on Moravian, topping the Greyhounds 66-52 in the Scotty Wood Tournament consolation game.




Freshman Rob Berish scored seven points in the first half and finished with nine for the game.



The game not only gave Muhlenberg its first win of the young season and new head coach Scott McClary his first “W,” it also gave it some retribution for falling to Moravian in the final of the Greyhound Starters Classic last season.

“As our rival, it’s always great to beat Moravian,” said sophomore Spencer Liddic. “We had a bad taste in our mouth after last year when they beat us.”

The Mules had no such problem this year, as they never trailed in the game and jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead by hitting their first three buckets. After a steal by senior Obi Nwizugbo on the game’s opening possession, Liddic put in a turnaround jumper. Senior Brian Frankoski set up the next two scores, finding senior Peter Barnes by the basket for a layup and senior Ryan Foster for a three-pointer.




Liddic averaged 12.5 points and 10.0 rebounds per game for the tournament.




Moravian fought back to cut the deficit to 13-11, but the Mules’ lead swelled to as high as 13 in the first half behind timely threes, clutch free-throw shooting (Muhlenberg shot 11-12 from the line in the period) and superb defense. Sophomore Justin Greenstone drew charges on consecutive possessions, then came up with a steal on the next. Foster also drew a charge with 24 seconds remaining in the half, sending the Mules to the break up 37-27.

“All of our guys are willing to sacrifice their bodies for the team,” said Liddic. “Those plays are such momentum changers. Someone takes a charge and everyone gets excited –
it can turn the game around.”

For the game the Mules held the Greyhounds to just 26.2 percent (16-for-61) shooting.

“We just tried to use our size advantage,” said Liddic. “We wanted to extend out on them and make it difficult for them to shoot over us.”

A fantastic three-point play by Liddic gave Muhlenberg its biggest lead at 64-45 with 4:32 to play, and the Mules held on from there.

Barnes and Liddic both recorded double-doubles. Barnes finished with 15 points and a career-high 16 rebounds to land on the all-tournament team, while Liddic added 13 points and 11 boards. Foster nailed four treys as part of a 14-point performance, and Frankoski had a game-high six assists.

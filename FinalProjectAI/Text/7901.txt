Men's Soccer Season Ends in "Sweet 16"
 Saturday, November 22, 2014 - page 2







					 




A memorable season for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team came to an end with a 2-0 home loss to Tufts in the 
“Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament.

The Jumbos (13-2-4) scored twice in the second half to earn a spot in the quarterfinals against two-time 
defending national champion Messiah, a 6-0 winner against Cortland State in the first game of the day.

Muhlenberg managed only six shots against the New England Small College Athletic Conference regular-season 
champion.

The Centennial Conference-champion Mules finished their season with a record of 15-2-3 – the first time since 1995
that they lost fewer than three matches in a season.

“I’m disappointed, but I’m really proud of our guys and how hard we fought,”
said senior Lance Dotzman, who served as team co-captain with Bryan Attanasio
(right). “No regrets.”

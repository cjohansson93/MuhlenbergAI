Baseball Wins 2 of 3 on Opening Weekend
 Sunday, February 24, 2013







					 





Sophomore Phillip Balseca pitched four innings in relief, tying a career high with five strikeouts, to earn the win in the first game of the Gallaudet doubleheader.


The Muhlenberg baseball team opened its 2013 season by winning two of three games in Washington, D.C.

The Mules swept Gallaudet on Saturday, winning 8-4 and 4-3, before suffering an 8-3 loss to Catholic on Sunday.

Two Muhlenberg veterans  were up to their old tricks in the first inning of the first game. In the top of the inning, senior Joseph Vila, one of the program’s all-time leaders in extra-base hits, doubled in two runs. In the bottom of the frame, senior Rob Shannon, who led the Centennial Conference in pickoffs last season, walked the first batter he faced, then picked him off.

The Mules led 3-2 after three and scored three more in the fourth, with sophomore Jimmy Cody (triple) and junior Nick Kennedy (double) providing back-to-back run-scoring extra-base hits.

Kennedy also singled in a run in the fifth with one of his three hits in the game. 

Muhlenberg combined four extra-base hits and a single to score all four of its runs in the second inning of the nightcap. Junior John Scuderi, sophomore Nick Plinio and senior John Muha all had doubles in the big inning, with junior Brett Rosen adding a triple.

Sophomore Matthew Lawsky had a 4-2 lead with two outs in the fifth before allowing three straight hitters to reach base, making the score 4-3. But he averted further damage by getting a groundout to short with the bases loaded, and the game was called after the inning due to darkness.

The Mules took a 3-1 lead in the third against Catholic on Vila’s RBI double and a two-run single by senior Jimmy Aramanda, but the Cardinals took advantage of errors to plate seven runs in the fourth and fifth innings.

Sophomore Chris Manfredonia had his school-record 24-game hitting streak snapped in the first game of the season.

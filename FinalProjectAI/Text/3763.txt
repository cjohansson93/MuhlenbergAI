Championships by 33 strokes in 2001.) 

The team total of 303 was the best for the Mules since they carded a 301 while winning the Messiah Falcon Classic in the fall of 2007.

Four Muhlenberg players were among the 13 golfers, in a field of 102, who shot 78 or better. Freshman Chris DiMaio tied for second, a stroke off the lead, with a 2-over-par 74. Senior
Zachary Oyer was a stroke behind, and sophomore Brandon Davis another stroke back. Senior Eric Boskey came in with a 78.
The Mules have won five tournaments since the fall 2007 season.

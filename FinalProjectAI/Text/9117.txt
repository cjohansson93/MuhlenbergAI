Key Findings

While over 4 in 10 adult Pennsylvanians (41%) report that they are âextremelyâ or âveryâ concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, overall concern levels in the Commonwealth have dropped significantly from March when almost 6 in 10 residents (57%) reported high levels of concern with this health situation.
Approval ratings for President Joe Bidenâs handling of the pandemic have declined in Pennsylvania since the spring, with only 40% of Keystone State adults currently approving of Bidenâs efforts on this issue, compared to 55% last March.
More Pennsylvanians disapprove (44%) of Governor Wolfâs handling of the COVID-19 pandemic than approve (35%) of his performance on this matter
Of adult Pennsylvanians that have received a COVID-19 vaccine, a large majority (76%) have either received or plan on receiving a booster shot.
Over the past 3 months, 1 out of 3 adult Pennsylvanians report that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on their mental health.
Pennsylvanians are highly divided on the issue of employers mandating their employees to get a COVID-19 immunization, with 50% indicating that employers should NOT be able to mandate immunizations, and 49% indicating that employers should be able to establish such a requirement.
A solid majority (60%) of Pennsylvanians agree that public schools in the Commonwealth should require students to wear masks.
About 6 in 10 (59%) Keystone State adults indicate that individuals who have not received a COVID-19 vaccination have put others at risk and have prolonged the length of the pandemic.
The percentage of Pennsylvanians who agree with the following statement varies widely according to political party: "There are major health risks for those that receive a COVID-19 vaccination."


Methodological StatementThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 419 adults in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between November 15 and 22, 2021. Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (88) and cell phones (331). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income, and educational attainment to reflect those Pennsylvania population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2021. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult Pennsylvanians, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 7%. Due to rounding, the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (as seen in its entirety below) was designed by Christopher P. Borick, Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Pubic Opinion (MCIPO), in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College and the Morning Call. For more detailed information on the methods employed please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

volleyball enjoys sweep of montclair state


The Muhlenberg volleyball team hasn't had the feeling of closing in on a win many times this year, so it's understandable that the Mules wanted to make it last as long as possible.

After missing on three match points, Muhlenberg finally completed its sweep of Montclair State with a 29-27 win in the third set. The victory sent the Mules home for their abbreviated Fall Break with huge smiles on their faces.

"It was great to see our hard work finally translate on the court," said junior Jackie Price. "We know 




Freshman Erica Wenzel led the defensive effort, tying her career high with 15 digs against Hopkins, then topping it with 17 in the Montclair State match.




it's been a big rebuilding year, but we've kept our heads up the whole season. Everybody's had a great attitude, and today we had a great result."

In the first match of the day, the Mules (3-19, 0-6) were swept by Johns Hopkins. But they showed their spunk in the third set, cutting a 15-9 deficit to 15-14 with five straight kills before the Blue Jays pulled away to close out the match, 25-19.

Muhlenberg stayed in attack mode right from the start vs. Montclair. Of their 79 points in the match, 50 came on kills, and it was a balanced attack that carried the team. Price, sophomore Jenn Seeba and freshman Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare recorded 10 kills apiece, junior Davi Gordon had 9, and junior Brooke McQueen added 8.

Many of the kills were set up by freshman Morgan Duggan, who had a career-high 41 assists.

Tied 21-21, the Mules closed out the first set with four straight kills, two from Seeba and one apiece from Duggan and Ojo-Ohikuare. Muhlenberg jumped out to a 21-7 lead en route to a 25-15 win in the second set.

The third set looked like it would be another quick one when the Mules took a 16-9 lead. The Red Hawks came back, however, going on a 9-1 run to take an 18-17 lead. It was back and forth the rest of the way. Muhlenberg led 24-23, 25-24 and 27-26 but did not secure the match until Gordon's soft placement into the middle of the court.

"It got a little tricky there in the third set," said Price. "We just took a deep breath, stayed aggressive and never gave up."

Gordon, who had 12 kills with no errors in the Hopkins match, made attack errors - her only two of the day - on her two previous attempts, when she took full swings with a chance to end the match.

"My teammates told me where the open spot was, and I said to Morgan, give me this ball," said Gordon. "I got a great pass and put it away."

And the Mules put away a well-deserved win, their first sweep of the season.

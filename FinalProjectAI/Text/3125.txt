Same old, same old for women’s hoops


Network television favorites like “American Idol” and “Lost” recently started new seasons, but at Memorial Hall reruns are still playing.

Following a familiar pattern (close low-scoring game at halftime, second-half run, win by 10-15 points), the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team knocked



Inserted for defense with 15 seconds left in the first half, freshman Kimberly Mui forced an errant inbounds pass, leading to a driving layup by Maiza Mock that gave the Mules a 21-19 lead at halftime.



 off Dickinson, 67-54, for its sixth straight win.

The Mules (13-2, 10-0) are the fourth team in Centennial Conference history to start off 10-0 in league play, joining Johns Hopkins in 1997 and 1998 and McDaniel in 2004. They have a three-game lead on McDaniel, the only other team in the CC with fewer than four league losses.

Down 17-10 late in the first half, Muhlenberg ended a six-minute scoring drought with an 8-0 run, highlighted by two coast-to-coast layups by sophomore Kelly McKeon.

Wrestlers Lose to King’s



The Muhlenberg wrestling team suffered a 39-6 loss at King’s to fall to 0-3 in dual meets.

Sophomore Keith Swanson (157) and senior Matt Horn (184) won by decision. Swanson’s 4-2 win came early, with two first-period takedowns, while Horn won late, scoring a reversal with 38 seconds left for a 2-1 win against a Monarch wrestler who came in with a nine-bout winning streak. Horn has won 10 in a row.

second half, when an 11-0 Mule run erased a 24-23 Red Devil lead. Back-to-back three-pointers from senior Lauren Boyle and freshman Alexandra Chili capped the surge.

Muhlenberg maintained a lead of 8-15 points the rest of the game.

In their last five wins, the Mules led by three, led by eight (although that was a one-point game with 2:30 left in the half), trailed by one, led by one and led by two at halftime. They won the games by 13, 10, 13, 7 and 13, respectively. In their three 13-point wins, they scored more than 40 points in the second half after netting 21 or fewer in the first half.

Against the Red Devils (7-7, 5-4), a team against which Muhlenberg had trouble scoring 40 in a whole game two years ago, the Mules put up 46 points after halftime. 

Other recurring themes were strong defense and solid ball-handling. In eight games since giving up 98 points to Moravian, Muhlenberg has allowed more than 59 only once. And after committing 11 turnovers in the first half, the Mules, who entered the week sixth in Division III in fewest turnovers, gave it up just four times in the second.

McKeon led Muhlenberg with 15 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. She also guarded Dickinson’s top scorer most of the night, holding her scoreless on 0-for-11 shooting. Boyle and Chili scored 14 points apiece, combining to go 10-for-10 from the foul line in the last 1:06. 

Boyle’s 14 points made her the 23rd player in CC history with 1,300 career points.

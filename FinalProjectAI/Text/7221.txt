Men’s Lacrosse, Women’s Tennis Fall to Tough Opponents


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team suffered a 17-7 setback at the hands of York, which was receiving votes in the latest national poll and took defending national champion Stevenson to overtime in its opener.

Freshman Elliot Dennis went 9-for-15 on faceoffs and scored the first goal of his career for the Mules, while sophomore Steven Casella netted a pair for the second straight game. Sophomore Kyle Larkin played the last 11 minutes at goalie, making eight saves while allowing only one goal.

The Muhlenberg wrestling team competed in the Centennial Conference Championships and the indoor track and field teams tuned up for theirs in style.


Jaryd Flank (right) finished fourth in the 125-pound bracket at the wrestling championships. After losing by major decision to the nation’s top wrestler, the freshman pinned an opponent from Gettysburg to advance to the consolation final, where he was edged, 5-4, in a tight decision by a foe from Stevens.

Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit dropped both of his matches at 149.

Track and field turned in a strong performance at Haverford’s Keogh Invitational a week ahead of the conference meet. The Mules had three winners on the day: seniors Nicki Cronin in the 3000 and Stephanie Carnevale in the 60-meter hurdles and sophomore Brandon Tauber in the high jump. 

Cronin and Carnevale posted ECAC-qualifying times, as did Claire Thornton, who finished third in the 800.



For the second consecutive meet, Muhlenberg turned in 28 performances that fell in the top eight, and 38 were either CC qualifiers or improved on existing conference qualifiers.

Ten Mules worked their way onto or up the program’s all-time top-10 lists. Sophomores Francesca Aldrich (60) and James Knight (60-meter hurdles) vaulted up to third, as did Cronin in the 3000. Junior Cody Geyer (fourth in the 60), Thornton (seventh in the 800), freshmen Jake Waleski (seventh in the 60) and Michelle Gaykowski (ninth in the shot put), and seniors Amber Lee Wojtkowski (ninth in the 60), Bobby McGetrick (10th in the 3000) and Lauren Zakheim (10th in the 800) joined them.

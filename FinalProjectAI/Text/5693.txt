Boyle Named Player of the Week



Junior Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was named Centennial Conference player of the week for the second time this season.

Boyle averaged 21.5 points, 8.0 assists and 6.0 rebounds to lead Muhlenberg to wins against McDaniel and Gettysburg, both of which came into the week with only one Centennial Conference loss. The two wins left the Mules (5-1) tied with only Dickinson (6-1) for first place in the loss column in the CC.

Boyle scored a game-high 21 points against McDaniel and narrowly missed a triple-double with 22 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds vs. Gettysburg. 

Heading into the Ramapo game, Boyle led the CC in free-throw percentage (.837) and was fifth in scoring (16.4 points per game) and sixth in assists (3.33 per game). 
She was tied for the team lead in steals (18) and was third in rebounding (4.9 rpg).




The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team helped put the “o” in Ramapo.

For almost the first 10 minutes of the game, the Mules took more shots that got lodged

between the backboard and the rim (one) than the Roadrunners took that went in. Ramapo (3-11) started out 0-for-14 from the field and did not make a bucket until the 10:08 mark. 

By that time, Muhlenberg had a 14-3 lead, and the Mules went on to their fifth straight win, 70-44.

Muhlenberg shot 52.9 percent on the first half in opening up a 38-21 lead at the break. The Mules (10-3) led by as many as 32 points in the second half and held Ramapo to 27.3-percent shooting.

Junior Lauren Boyle led Muhlenberg with 15 points, and sophomore Maiza Mock added 10 on perfect 4-for-4 shooting. Freshman Kelly McKeon recorded seven points, five rebounds, four assists and four steals in only 18 minutes of action.

The game was an opportunity for the parents of Muhlenberg’s North Jersey contingent – juniors Erin McSherry and Kaitlin Strumph and sophomores Kaitlyn O’Malley and Alyssa Scaglione – to make a shorter-than-usual drive to see their daughters play. All four locals contributed, with McSherry scoring eight points and receiving credit for two blocked shots, Strumph posting six points and five rebounds, O’Malley scoring five points and Scaglione pulling down five rebounds.

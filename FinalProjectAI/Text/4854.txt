Tennis teams sweep McDaniel 



Lacrosse Teams Fall to Gettysburg


The Muhlenberg women's lacrosse team hung tough with No. 3 Gettysburg in the first half but ultimately lost, 18-9.

The Bullets (7-0, 2-0) jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead in the first five minutes, but the Mules (4-1, 0-1) stormed right back. Junior Danielle Rosen scored two goals just 22 seconds apart to cut the deficit to one.



The Bullets eventually went up 10-7 late in the half, and junior Allisyn Vachon made two big saves to keep it that way, stopping a pair of Gettysburg free-position shots in the final 10 seconds of the period.

The Bullets squashed any chance of an upset in the second half, scoring eight of the 10 goals, including six straight over a seven-minute stretch. Gettysburg's goalie stopped 10 Mule shots in the period.

Rosen (right) was the lone Mule with multiple goals, netting four. Vachon turned away 13 shots in net.

The Muhlenberg men's tennis team cruised in its first Centennial Conference match of the season, defeating McDaniel 9-0.

Sophomores Jordan Rutt and Zach Adler (left) had perhaps the biggest victory of the day, winning 8-5 at No. 1 doubles to avenge an 8-6 loss to the same Green Terror (0-1, 0-1) doubles team last season. Rutt also knocked off McDaniel's No. 1 singles player, 6-4, 6-2, who last year won at second singles.

Adler, senior Mark Apostolos and freshman Ari Nutovits all rolled to 6-0, 6-0 victories in singles for the Mules (2-1, 1-0). Junior Robbie Goldwein faced a challenge at No. 2 singles but responded with an impressive 7-1 win in a second-set tiebreak to earn the victory.

Goldwein and senior Yoni Farber teamed up for an 8-1 win at third doubles, and senior Matt Kral and junior Wayne Mitchel did the same at second doubles. Kral also won in straight sets at No. 4 singles.

The women's tennis team also beat McDaniel, winning via forfeit when the Green Terror arrived with only three players (four are required for an official match).

The Mules (2-1) are 1-0 to start CC play for the sixth time in the last seven seasons.

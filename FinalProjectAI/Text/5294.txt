basketball teams sweep cc awards



Muhlenberg basketball players Ryan Foster and Kelly McKeon were selected as the Centennial Conference players of the week.


Foster averaged 16.5 points and 9.0 rebounds while shooting 
75 percent (9-of-12) from beyond the arc in wins vs. Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins that lifted the Mule men’s team
into sole possession of third place in the CC. He poured in 21 points with five triples vs. the Garnet and had 12 points, four threes and 12 rebounds vs. the Jays.
Foster hit two treys in the final 1:04 to turn a four-point deficit into a two-point lead and blocked the potential game-tying shot in the final seconds at Hopkins.

For the season, Foster leads Muhlenberg in three-pointers (47) and free-throw percentage (.796) and is second in scoring (11.6 points per game) and 
third in rebounding (6.0 per game), assists (42), steals (21) and blocked shots (13). In stats for league games only, he is second in the CC in three-pointers.

McKeon had another solid week, leading the Mule women to their 19th and 20th wins of the season. She averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists in wins vs. 
Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins, including a season-high 18 markers vs. the Garnet. McKeon flirted with a triple-double vs. the Jays with 10 points, 10 rebounds and seven 
assists with no turnovers in 38 minutes.

McKeon leads the Mules with 109 assists – the third-highest single-season total in team history. She also tops the squad in rebounding (8.0 per game) and steals (36) and is

Women's Lacrosse Blanks Bryn Mawr for First CC Win

The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team got rid of one zero on its ledger and put another one on.

The Mules shut out Bryn Mawr, 14-0, to snap a five-game losing streak and pick up their first Centennial Conference win of the season.

The shutout was the second this season for Muhlenberg, which blanked Merchant Marine by the same score in March. Entering the season, the Mules had only one shutout 
in their history.

Muhlenberg scored 10 goals in the first 20 minutes, before the Owls (2-12, 0-8) took a shot. Bryn Mawr’s lone shot of the game was a free-position attempt
late in the first half that was saved.

In keeping with the zeroes theme, sophomore Stephanie Umbach picked up two by scoring three goals, giving her an even 100 points for her career. She is the 22nd player in team history to reach the century mark, and the third to do so this season. The three goals gave her 51 for the season, tying the second-highest total in team history. Umbach also recorded nine draw controls to move to within three of tying the Mules’ single-season record of 69.

Junior Michelle Certosimo led Muhlenberg with four points on a goal and three assists. Senior Alexandra Franck (left) was part of the defensive effort that produced the shutout and also scored her first career goal.

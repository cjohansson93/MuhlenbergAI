Season Preview

young team no hairy propositionfor women’s soccer


There's been one constant on the field for the Muhlenberg women's soccer roster the last four years: Lauren Petri. Make that two constants - Petri and her long, braided ponytail.

 Petri is one of only two seniors on a young Mule squad that will take 




Petri cut her hair for the first time after her sophomore year, so her distinctive ponytail is actually a little shorter than it used to be. 





to the field for the first time in 2010 against St. Joseph's at the Kean Classic on Saturday. 

After winning the Centennial Conference regular-season championship and earning an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament with a senior-dominated team last year, Muhlenberg will have a different look this fall. Petri and Valerie Patriarca (who did not play for the Mules as a sophomore) are joined by three healthy juniors; the rest of the team consists of five sophomores and 10 freshmen.

"It's a lot different," said Petri. "When we were coming up through the program we always looked up to the seniors. Now we're much more team oriented - we look to the younger players for advice. We're all involved a lot more."

That will extend to the field, where the Mules will employ a little different style than they have in the past to take advantage of the different talents of their players.

And even though almost half of the team consists of freshmen, it's not like Muhlenberg is 




Patriarca started six games last year and scored a pair of goals.




starting from scratch. "As young as we are, the half of us that are back have a lot of experience," noted Petri.

In fact, the Mules can field all-conference players right up the middle of the field, starting at goalie with junior Michele Toher, who had a 0.95 goals-against average in CC games last year. Sophomore Maggie Neary had a fabulous freshman year, earning second-team All-CC honors while starting at center back.

Juniors Meghan O'Grady and Nicolette Miller have both made the All-CC team each of the last two years. Miller leads all active Mules in career points with 37, and O'Grady is right behind her with 29.

Petri and Patriarca will both move to the back after experiencing success as forwards. Petri had a breakthrough season last year, finishing second on the team with 13 points, and Patriarca scored 10 goals as a freshman.

"I like it," said Petri of her new position. "That's where I played in high school and on my club team. It's working well."

Sophomore Alyssa Meola, a starter in 10 games at center midfield last year, adds to the team's strong central core, and classmates Jessica Gonzalez and Natalie Wizel return after playing in reserve roles last year.

The rest of the lineup will be filled in by freshmen, and between the new faces and new system, the Mules hope to have everything figured out by the time they make their unusually late home opener on September 25.

"We're still working through things, but it's starting to click," said Petri. "Getting some full games in will be good for us."

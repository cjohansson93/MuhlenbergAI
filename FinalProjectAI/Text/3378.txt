Men’s lacrosse breaks through with ot win 


If you’ve looked at the top 15 teams on the Division III lacrosse poll over the past 



The Mules celebrate with Jacobson (left) after his game-winning goal.



few weeks, it looks eerily like Muhlenberg’s men’s schedule. Of the Mules’ six opponents, five were ranked in the top 15 in the division at the time of game.

The Mules weren’t facing a nationally ranked team when they took on Swarthmore today, but that didn’t mean they were in the clear to post their first win. The teams had split the last six games; four of the games were decided by three goals or less.

And it took an extra 4:51 to decide the winner. Junior midfielder Ari Jacobson scored an unassisted 
goal with 3:09 left in the second overtime to lift Muhlenberg to its first win of the season, 4-3.

After falling behind 3-1 at halftime, the Garnet (3-4, 2-2) came back, scoring two goals in the fourth to tie the score.

With the Mules a man down, sophomore goalkeeper Mike Horowitz made a key stop in 



Junior Al Carpetto scored his first goal of the season to give the Mules a 3-0 lead early in the second quarter.



the final 15 seconds to keep the tie and send the game into overtime.

Each team had a shot in the first extra period, but the game remained tied and went on to a second overtime.

Senior John DeLuca won the faceoff at the start of the second overtime, and less than 

a minute later Jacobson netted the game-winner from the left wing for his sixth goal of the season.

The Mule defense held Swarthmore scoreless for the first 24 minutes of the game and for another span of 24 minutes from the second through fourth quarters. The three goals were the fewest Muhlenberg has ever allowed in a Centennial Conference game.

“Our defense and our goaltending were outstanding and definitely won the game for us,” said senior Dan Dugan, who went 6-for-9 on faceoffs to become the program’s career leader with 192 career faceoffs won.

Horowitz had 12 saves. DeLuca scooped up a team-leading five ground balls, with sophomores Tom Brant and Andy Curley picking up four apiece. Brant also caused two turnovers.

“We’re hoping to build off this, just like last year,” said Dugan.

Last season the Mules went on an eight-game winning streak starting with their game against Swarthmore and qualified for the CC playoffs.

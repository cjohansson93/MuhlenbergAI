2010 football captains named




Three Football Players Receive Academic Honor



Three soon-to-be Muhlenberg alumni recently were named to the Hampshire Honor Society by the National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame.

Codie Bender, Matt Boland and Jake Floyd were among 620 college football players who met the following requirements:

• Being a starter or a significant substitute in his last year of eligibility at an accredited NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, Football Championship Subdivision, 
Division II, Division III, or an NAIA college or university; 
• Achieving a 3.2 cumulative grade point average throughout entire course of undergraduate study; and 
• Meeting all NCAA-mandated progress towards degree requirements.

Bender (history major), Boland (accounting and finance) and Floyd (finance) all were four-year members of the Mule football team.





Three defensive players – Scott Gavin, Marc Accomando and Patrick McDonough – were elected captains of the 2010 Muhlenberg football team.

Gavin (above left) is a three-year letterwinner and two-year starter at inside linebacker. A second-team All-Centennial Conference selection in 2008, he will enter
his senior season with career totals of 97 tackles, 7 tackles for loss, 2 sacks and 2 interceptions.

Accomando (above center) was a full-time starter for the first time last year, lining up at rover in all 10 games and finishing fifth on the team with 39 tackles. He also
had a team-high 4 pass breakups. Accomando recorded 41 tackles as a sophomore in 2008.

McDonough (above right) has started at inside linebacker in both of his years at Muhlenberg since transferring from Virginia Military Institute. He was named to 
the All-CC first team last fall after making a team-high 80 tackles, the fourth-most in the CC. He was sixth on the Mules with 44 tackles in 2008.

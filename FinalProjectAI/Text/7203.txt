Cross Country Teams Sweep Team, Individual Titles
 Saturday, September 21, 2013 - page 2







					 



In a week when both Muhlenberg cross country teams learned that they were regionally ranked, they looked the part in dominating the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational.




Munyan (left) and Flank finished nine seconds apart and were the only two runners to complete the 6-kilometer course in under 20 minutes.




Both Mule squads won the team title for the second year in a row, and the meet co-hosts also produced both individual gold medalists in senior Nicki Cronin
and junior Luke Munyan.

It was the fifth time since the meet began in 1993 that Muhlenberg swept the team titles, but the first team that both race winners came from Muhlenberg.




Burns ran seven seconds faster than she did in the same race last year.




A car that drove ahead of runners, beeping spectators away from the course, was the only competition for Cronin, who won by a whopping 46 seconds. She was the seventh
Mule female to win the meet and set a meet record for highest finish by a Cronin – her older sister Jenn, running unattached, came in second last year.

Munyan, on the other hand, had someone to flank him for most of the race – freshman Jaryd Flank, who came in a close second. Munyan is only
the third member of the Muhlenberg men’s team to cross the line first at Cedar Crest, and the first since 2003.

Munyan and Flank led an impressive performance by the men, who had the first four finishers and seven of the top nine. Sophomore Stephen Sroka and junior
Kenny Wohl came in third and fourth, respectively, and after runners from Moravian and Ursinus interrupted the parade of Mules, juniors
Zach Lifman and Joshua Elkan and senior Jarrett Felix resumed it.

Muhlenberg’s 17 team points, only two more than the lowest score possible, were far ahead of second-place Ursinus (71) and third-place Moravian (77).

The women’s race was a little closer, with the Mules finishing nine points ahead of Ursinus despite competing without their No. 2 runner from the first meet of the
season. Sophomore Claire Thornton finished seventh in her season debut, with senior Ramzy Burns (11th), junior Chelsea
Rivenbark (13th) and senior Lauren Zakheim (14th) also placing in the top 15.

Women's Basketball Falls to Undefeated Moravian
 Sunday, December 16, 2012 - page 2







					 





Laney finished with eight points and five rebounds.



The number 60 continued to be a critical figure for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team as it fell to Moravian, 64-60, for its first loss against the Greyhounds since 2008. In all three of the Mules’ losses this season, they have given up more than 60 points.

Despite holding a 31-27 lead at halftime, the Mules (6-3) gave up 37 second-half points to the undefeated Greyhounds (9-0).

While there were four lead changes in the first half, neither team had more than a four-point advantage until after the break. 

Just 44 seconds into the second half, the Mules doubled their lead to eight points on back-to-back jumpers by senior Julie Kelly and junior Erin Laney.

With 7:40 remaining, however, the Greyhounds jumped to a 47-46 lead, their first since the 1:27 mark in the first half.

The Mules took the lead back with 6:07 to play on a lefty layup by junior Katy Mitton, who finished with a career- and team-high 10 points.

A three-pointer by Moravian on the next possession put the Greyhounds on top again, but Muhlenberg proceeded to tie it up 22 seconds later on a three by sophomore Nicole Pepe.

A free throw and a series of offensive rebounds followed by a score put the Greyhounds back up by three with 3:00 to play.

Two baskets by senior Kate Clawson sandwiched around a Moravian three made it 58-56 with about a minute-and-a-half remaining. Muhlenberg came up empty on its next two possessions with a chance to tie or take the lead, and the Greyhounds made four free throws to extend their lead to six with less than 40 seconds on the clock.

Layups by sophomore Hannah Rush and junior Colleen Caldwell cut the gap to 62-60 with 4.3 seconds left, but Moravian iced the win by sinking two free throws.
	
Senior Alita Zabrecky led the team on the boards with 12 rebounds and added nine points, just shy of her fifth double-double of the season. She now needs just seven points to put her at 1,000 for her career.

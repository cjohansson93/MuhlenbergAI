 Elizabeth Kelsey Political Socialization of Eighth-Graders in a Post-September 11 EnvironmentThis study assesses the impact of media coverage of the attacks of September 11, 2001 on children's views toward government institutions. A sample of 25 eighth-grade students and their parents were surveyed about their TV viewing habits and opinions regarding trust in government institutions, civil liberties, and their sense of security. Results revealed that, despite general feelings of political apathy, children exhibited increased levels of trust in government after September 11th when compared with previous levels over a 20-year period. Beginning with the project's inception, I will present a number of documents - both rooted in research and in organization - that speak to the development of this project, as well as items that are considered "final" products of the research

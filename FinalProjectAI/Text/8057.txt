Field Hockey Picks Up First CC Win Behind Thies Hat Trick
 Friday, September 26, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg field hockey team is a well-rounded squad with multiple threats on offense, but during a 5-2 win over Johns Hopkins, senior Kayleigh Thies stood out.

The 2013 All-American notched her first career hat trick in the victory, slicing and dicing the opposition’s defense and ripping accurate shots from all over the circle. The hat trick is the first by a Mule since Tara Cohn scored three against Moravian in 2008.

“I really wanted to score goals for my teammates,” said Thies, who is now tied for sixth all-time on the Mules’ career goals list with 32. “There have been some games that I have been getting assists, but tonight I wanted to send a message to the conference.”

Message received. Since going without a goal in the first three games, Thies (left) has scored five in the last four contests.

At the other end, seniors Heather Porrini, Allie Califano and Ray Gallagher and sophomore Claudia Theriault highlighted a defensive effort that let the Mules climb to a 4-0 lead in the first hour of playing time.

“Personally I wanted to work on doing the small things really well,” said Gallagher, who was a dart throughout the field against the Blue Jays. “I think that was a mindset the entire team had as well.”

Muhlenberg (5-2, 1-1) has been clear since the start of the season that it has a Centennial Conference title in its sights, and beating Johns Hopkins, a team it had not defeated since 2009, shows that it is back on the right track after falling in its CC opener at McDaniel a week ago.



“We play our best when we play as a unit,” continued Gallagher, “and we wanted to send a message to the conference that when we play like this, we can beat anybody.”

The Mules were on the attack early. Senior Christine Germaske got things rolling with a goal in the fifth minute, taking a perfect pass from classmate Lauren Jordan and tapping it in from the left side of the cage.

A little under 15 minutes later, Thies made the most impressive run of the game, dribbling past defenders and ripping a shot with a reverse sweep from the top-left side of the circle for her first goal of the night. Thies would knock in the next two goals less than a minute apart in the second half, giving the Mules a four-goal lead.  The first of the two was off a corner from senior Samantha Swire, giving her a conference-best six assists on the season. 

Sophomore Taylor Smith (right) scored the final Muhlenberg goal, winning possession close to the cage and putting away her first career tally.

The turnaround for the team to get back in the win column was well calculated.

“We all have watched a lot of film this week,” added Thies. “We all met together last week [after the loss to McDaniel] and said this is not how we want our season to be. We have been working really hard as a unit, doing everything together as a team, and it is obviously working really well.”

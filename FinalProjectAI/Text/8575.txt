Kathleen Harring, Ph.D.  â
Muhlenberg PresidentProfessor of PsychologyPresident's Office, 3rd Floor Haas College Center
Background B.A., Franklin and Marshall College; M.S., Ph.D., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
2012-2013 American Council on Education Fellow.
Dr. Harring is a social psychologist with a minor in quantitative psychology. After many years as a respected and beloved full time professor in the department, she served as Provost and now serves at the 13th President of Muhlenberg College. Luckily for us, she will continue to teach one course in the Psychology Department each year, including statistics and health psychology.
She writes: As a psychology professor, I teach students how to think more critically about their own and others' behavior. Because there are so many areas and situations where we can apply psychological concepts, we always have new questions to answer and new ideas to examine. I try to share my excitement for psychology with my students and it is quite rewarding when they tell me that they talk about psychological theory and research with their friends and roommates.
Teaching at a small liberal arts college like Muhlenberg gives me the opportunity to get to know my students at a personal level. Our classes are small and many students take more than one course with me. In addition, I usually have several students who work with me as research assistants.
Another plus about teaching at Muhlenberg are my interactions with faculty and students from other disciplines. Having a biology or business major in my health psychology course adds a different perspective and enhances the learning experiences for both the students and me.
Also -- since Muhlenberg places a high priority on excellent teaching -- the faculty spend a great deal of time thinking and talking about teaching. I enjoy being part of a community that places such a high value on undergraduate teaching!

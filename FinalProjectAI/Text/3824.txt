Two Football Players Tabbed Preseason All-Americans

The first snaps of the 2011 season are still six weeks away, but praise has already started to roll in for the Muhlenberg football team.

Two seniors on the Mule defense, linebacker Patrick McDonough and defensive 



end Kenneth Cobb, were named to preseason All-America teams.

McDonough was selected to the D3football.com first team, while Cobb was a second-team choice by D3football.com and Lindy’s.

McDonough (right) was named second-team All-American, Centennial Conference defensive player of the year, first-team All-CC and first-team All-South Region last year. He led the Mules with 105 tackles in 10 games to become the first Muhlenberg player to average double digits in tackles per game since 1997. He led the CC and tied for 30th in Division III in total tackles, adding 5½ tackles for loss, including 3 sacks, and a forced fumble. 

McDonough had some of his highest totals in tackles against the top teams on the Mule schedule. He recorded a high of 14 stops in the 




season opener against nationally ranked Delaware Valley and had 13 in a 30-27 win at defending CC champion Johns Hopkins. McDonough also made 13 stops in a win at Dickinson and a one-point loss at Moravian, earning the Bianco Award as Muhlenberg’s MVP in the latter game. He had a game-high 9 tackles against Wesley in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 

Cobb (left) was a second-team All-South Region pick after his breakout 2010 season in which he set a school record with 11 sacks and led the team with 16½ tackles for loss. Cobb tied for the CC lead and tied for 14th in Division III in sacks. He finished with 52 total tackles and added 7 pass breakups, 3 forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. 

Cobb’s biggest game came in a 27-20 win against Ursinus that clinched a share of the CC title and an NCAA Tournament bid for the Mules. He recorded 4½ sacks — the most by a CC player since 2004 and one short of the school record — for losses of 46 yards, helping Muhlenberg limit the regionally ranked Bears to 33 rushing yards on 32 carries. 

The McDonough- and Cobb-led Mule defense allowed fewer than 300 yards and 20 points per game for the 10th consecutive year in 2010. Muhlenberg finished the season 7-4 and earned a share of its record-tying ninth CC championship. 

The 2011 season is scheduled to open on September 3 at Delaware Valley, which is nationally ranked in several preseason polls.

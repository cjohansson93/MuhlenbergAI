faust adds another gold in pole vault





Weidmann’s five points for placing fourth in the pole vault helped the Mule women to a third-place standing after two events. Muhlenberg had 17 points to 20 for Johns
Hopkins and 21 for Haverford.



Muhlenberg sophomore Alex Faust is 4-for-4 in the Centennial Conference pole vault.

Faust matched her 2007 outdoor title and 2007 and 2008 gold-medal performances by vaulting 11 feet, 1¾ inches on the first day of the CC Championships, hosted by
Gettysburg. Her height set a meet record and tied the school and conference records she set last year.

Faust is the first Mule athlete to win the same event at the conference championship meet both indoors and outdoors as a freshman and sophomore. She led three Mule 
placewinners in the pole vault, as freshmen Lindsey Weidmann and Hayley Krieger came in fourth and seventh, respectively.

Junior Timothy Van Syckle was the only other placewinnner for Muhlenberg, finishing fourth in the 10,000 meters. The 10K and pole vault were the only contested
finals on the first day of the three-day meet.

Senior Michael Karchner got off to a fantastic start in the decathlon, accumulating 3,088 points in opening up a 289-point lead. Of the five events, he won two,
tied for first in another, and finished second in the other two.

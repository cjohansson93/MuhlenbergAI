Softball Erupts In Nightcap To Earn Split At Dickinson

The Muhlenberg softball team has shown a propensity to score a lot of runs in Centennial Conference play this season. So when the Mules were shut out in the opening game of their doubleheader at Dickinson (10-22, 6-6), chances were good they would light up the scoreboard in the second game. 




Klotz added an RBI single in the seventh inning of game two to finish with two hits, two RBI and one run scored.


 

And that’s exactly what happened as the Mules posted crooked numbers in the first, fourth and seventh to take game two, 9-2. The split moved Muhlenberg into a tie in the loss column with Washington for fourth place in the conference.

After failing to score at least six runs in a CC game for the first time this season in a 1-0 loss to the reigning conference pitcher of the week in game one, the Mules (14-16, 8-4) got started right away in the nightcap.

Facing the same pitcher again, they struck for two runs in the first on a Kelly Kline RBI single and a sacrifice fly from sophomore Chelsea Benjamin.

They added four more in the fourth when freshman Jaimie Klotz and junior Devon Barber delivered back-to-back RBI singles. They both eventually came around to score to make it 6-0.

That would be more than enough for junior Angie Sisco, who delivered one of her best performances of the season, scattering seven hits and allowing just two runs in the sixth to pick up her fourth win of the season. It’s the third time this season she’s allowed two runs or less in a complete-game effort.

Muhlenberg tacked on three insurance runs in the seventh, highlighted by Kline’s RBI double.  It was her record 22nd extra-base hit of the season and brought her season RBI total to 42.

She also tied another school record in the win, but this time it was with her glove instead of her bat. Thanks in large part to Sisco’s ability to keep the ball down and induce groundouts, Kline finished with 16 putouts, tying the school record for a seven-inning game set in 1990 and tied in 1998.

Barber finished the day with three hits, including a triple in the opener, and two runs scored. She also stole her 47th career base, moving within one of second place on the school’s career list. Freshman Alyssa Schell collected two hits in the doubleheader with an RBI and two runs scored in game two. 

Freshman Kelsey Jones was the tough-luck loser in the opener, allowing just three hits in the first five innings before surrendering the lone run in the sixth.

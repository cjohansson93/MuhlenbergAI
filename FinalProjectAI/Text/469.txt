Things that might have happened Selections from Transformational Imagemaking: Handmade Photography since 1960
‌
March 16 - April 16, 2016Opening Reception, March 16 4:30 - 6:00pm.
Transformational Imagemaking originally opened at CEPA Gallery in 2014. The show, curated by Robert Hirsch, featured over 140 works by more than 40 artists. For our exhibition we have selected works where the artist's hand is evident in each piece. Our particular interest is in the politics of process. Disavowing the visionary photographer is not a prerequisite, but often comes to pass when multi-step photographic processes are disrupted by paint, collage, and other forms of obfuscation. This lively exhibition features works by Thomas Barrow, Wayne Belger, Stephen Berkman, Binh Danh, Rick Dingus, Robert Flynt, Judith Golden, Betty Hahn, Harold Jones, William Larson, Martha Madigan, Chris McCaw, Ted Orland, Holly Roberts, Maggie Taylor, and John Wood.
The Reception for Things that might have happened will feature a conversation about some of the works included led by Joe Elliott, Professor of Art at Muhlenberg and Paul Nicholson, Director of the Martin Art Gallery.

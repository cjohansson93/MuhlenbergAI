Ursinus Sweeps Two; Field Hockey in Playoffs


Field Hockey


Despite losing at home to sixth-ranked Ursinus, 8-0, the Muhlenberg field hockey team clinched a berth in next week’s Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Mules (11-6, 6-3) were assured of a postseason game for the second year in a row when Dickinson lost to Gettysburg. Muhlenberg hosts 19th-ranked Gettysburg Friday
night in a game that will help to determine the seedings for the playoffs.

Ursinus (14-2, 8-1), the defending national champion and top-scoring team in Division III, continued its rampage, scoring four goals in each half. Since getting
their 44-game CC winning streak snapped by Franklin & Marshall, the Bears have outscored their last six opponents by a 43-1 margin.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team jumped up to No. 4, its highest ranking of the season, in the NSCAA Middle Atlantic poll.

The Mules (10-3) have won five in a row, including a 2-1 defeat of New Jersey, then ranked first in the Metro Region and tied for seventh in Division III, last week.

Muhlenberg faces a stern test tomorrow when it travels to Swarthmore (fifth in the region) for a key Centennial Conference game. The Garnet is the only team to have
defeated Franklin & Marshall this season.

1. Messiah (14-2)
2. Franklin & Marshall (14-1)
3. Johns Hopkins (13-3)
4. MUHLENBERG (10-3)

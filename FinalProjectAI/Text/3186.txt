deluca, floyd named toacademic all-america team



Two Muhlenberg football players, senior John DeLuca and junior Jake Floyd, were named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-America second team, 
selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

An accounting major, DeLuca (left) was voted the Centennial Conference offensive player of the year after rushing for a school-record 1,634 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
Through games of Nov. 22, he ranked ninth in Division III in rushing yards per game and 15th in all-purpose yards per game. DeLuca ran for at least 100 yards in 10 of the
Mules’ 11 games, with two 200-yard efforts. He finished his career as Muhlenberg’s second leading rusher with 4,041 rushing yards, good for 
sixth on the CC all-time list.

DeLuca, who earned All-America honors in lacrosse last spring, owns the unique distinction of being an All-American in one sport and an Academic All-American in another. The only


other athletes in College history to earn both prestigious honors are Elaine Gratrix ’91 (softball) and Matt Loesch ’07 (wrestling). 

A finance major and double minor in political science and entrepreneurial studies, Floyd (right) was an important member of the defense in his first year as a starter. He started
every game at defensive end and recorded 24 tackles. Floyd was second on the Mules and tied for fifth in the CC with 10 tackles for loss, including three sacks, and forced a fumble.
Muhlenberg is 17th in Division III in total defense.

To be eligible for Academic All-America honors, a student-athlete must be a varsity starter or key reserve, maintain a cumulative grade point average of 
3.30 on a scale of 4.00, have reached sophomore athletic and academic standings at his current institution and be nominated by his sports information director. 
Since the program’s inception in 1952, CoSIDA has bestowed Academic All-America honors on more than 14,000 student-athletes in Divisions I, II, III and 
NAIA covering all NCAA championship sports.

Counting DeLuca and Floyd, Muhlenberg has had 12 football players named to the Academic All-America team, including three in the last two years.

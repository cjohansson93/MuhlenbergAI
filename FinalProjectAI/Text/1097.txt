COVID Alert Level Change: High



A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg community

Saturday, November 14, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
The College continues to monitor the situation on campus and locally to determine the appropriate COVID-19 alert level. The testing conducted this week has revealed additional positive tests. In order to continue to safeguard our community and contain any potential spread of the virus we are raising our COVID-19 campus alert to Level 3: High Alert. I recognize that these restrictions are difficult, however, we are entering our last week of the semester on campus and we each need to be vigilant to protect one another.
The move to Level 3 includes the following restrictions:

All classes will move to remote instruction as of Monday, November 16;
All meals will be to-go only through the Wood Dining Commons as of brunch Sunday, November 15. IMPORTANT: You will receive an email from Kate Shelley with your designated lunch and dinner times. Breakfast will be picked-up along with your dinner. Please enter Seegers Union through north Tower Doors, nearest to the Wood Dining Commons. All other doors will be secured;
Students must shelter in place in their rooms other than to pick up to-go meals. This means no visitors in your room. All facilities on campus other than your residence hall will be closed for access;
Everyone on campus should continue to complete the symptom checker daily, but please remain aware of any health-related changes you may experience throughout the day;
Faculty and staff should work from home wherever possible and only come to campus if absolutely necessary;
Campus facilities (e.g. Life Sports Center, library, academic buildings, Seegers Union, etc.) will be closed; and
All in-person events must move to virtual platforms.

ON-CAMPUS Students:

The phased approach to the residence hall visitor policy has been suspended. There should be no visitors in individual rooms or apartments. Students may socialize in a socially distanced way in the hallway and with doors open only, not in lounges;
All sport practices and group fitness classes are suspended; and
Students should remain on campus at all times and in their individual rooms other than picking up meals. 

OFF-CAMPUS Students:

We are amending our COVID Limitations on Groups Policy immediatelyâthere should be NO student gatherings of any size off campus. You are strongly encouraged to stay home in your apartment with your housemates. Do not socialize with other groups and do not host any visitors.

REMOTE Students:

Do not travel to campus at this time unless you have explicit permission from the College.
Do not travel to Allentown to visit with off-campus students.

Given the need to do everything we can to prevent community spread, students should expect that the COVID-19 Policy will be strictly enforced. Any enrolled students in violation of the Policy and/or these requests by the College can expect to be sent home immediately and will not be allowed to live on or access campus for Spring 2021.
Please make sure to wear your mask properly at all times, maintain social distance and ensure that you are washing your hands throughout the day. Any on-campus students choosing to leave early should notify their RA and turn in their key upon departure.
Please remember that when we have positive cases in our community, anyone on campus deemed a close contact will be notified individually. The College will provide testing and quarantine housing to close contacts as needed.
We expect that everyone will do their part to keep our community safe and healthy.

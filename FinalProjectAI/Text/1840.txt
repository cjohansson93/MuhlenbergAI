Preprofessional Programs


Muhlenberg provides support for students and alumni preparing for careers in law, medicine and the other health professions (dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, etc.). Our mission is to guide those interested in legal and health careers toward setting realistic goals and maximizing their undergraduate education.
We offer guidance at every step of the process: selecting appropriate and challenging courses, gaining relevant experience outside of the classroom, preparing for professional school admissions tests and applying to specific programs. Individual appointments may be scheduled with advisors, and there are also periodic information sessions for all class years.  In addition, we invite law and healthcare professionals to campus to meet with interested students, as well as admissions representatives from select schools.

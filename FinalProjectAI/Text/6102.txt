Wrestlers Compete in Virginia


It was another successful day for the seniors on the Muhlenberg wrestling team with the three combining to go 6-3 in a quad match with McDaniel and New York University at Washington and Lee.

The Mules won five of 11 contested bouts, led by Kevin Homan  and John Sternlicht, who each went 2-1 with a pin and a decision. Classmate Nick Pallotta  also went 2-1 with a pin and a win by forfeit.

In the opening match with Centennial Conference newcomer NYU, the Mules split the contested bouts with Homan needing just 2:05 to pick up his first pin in conference action. Pallotta added another of his 
quick pins at heavyweight, needing just 48 seconds to record the 33rd fall his career as Muhlenberg won the contested bouts, 12-9, but counting forfeits fell, 45-12.

Muhlenberg won three bouts, including two of three contested, against the host Generals. Homan grabbed a 4-1 decision at 149 and Sternlicht pinned his opponent in 1:48. The Mules won the contested 
bouts, 9-6, but fell 30-15 on forfeits.

Sternlicht picked up Muhlenberg’s lone win in the finale against the Green Terror, earning a 5-4 decision at 184 in the 49-3 loss. 

Homan moved to 25-7 on the year with five pins, while Sternlicht improved to 7-6.

distance runners and the men’s relay teams.

Junior Samantha Mayden won the mile with a personal-best time of 5:08.81. Entering this weekend, only one runner in the Centennial Conference had posted a better time this season.

Junior Erica Bash also won her event (the 800) with a personal-best performance (2:22.13). Sophomore Nicki Cronin was second in the mile and fifth in the 800.

Senior Nicolette Miller threatened the school record in the 1,000, clocking in at 3:08.18 – 1.02 seconds off the record – to finish fourth.

Both men’s sprint relay teams landed in the top 10 on the Mules’ all-time performance list. The 4x200, running for the first time this year, posted the fifth-fastest time in team history, while the 4x400 sprinted to fourth place on the performance list.

Seniors Peter Rice and Kyle Sullivan and sophomore Andrew Onimus were on both relay teams. Onimus also added a personal best in the 400, and sophomore Jake Ullmann, who completed the 4x400, entered the performance list in the 400 in sixth place.

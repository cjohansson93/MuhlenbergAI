two earn places at cc wrestling meet



The Muhlenberg wrestling team closed out its 2009-10 season by finishing seventh out of eight teams at the Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by Stevens.

After going through a difficult winless dual-meet campaign, the Mules finished ahead of Gettysburg and just a point behind sixth-place Washington and Lee at the CC meet.

Sophomore Kevin Homan had an impressive run through the tournament for the second straight year. Seeded third, Homan was tied 4-4 with the second seed from Ursinus
when he took him down to his back and pinned him with 
34 seconds left in the third period of his semifinal match. In the final, Homan ran up against a Stevens wrestler who swept through the CC season without a loss and was defeated by technical fall.

Homan (right) ended the year with a record of 14-12.

Muhlenberg’s other placewinner was junior Keith Swanson at 157. Swanson lost his first bout to the eventual champion but came back to win his first two consolation bouts. The second win came by 5-4 decision against a Johns Hopkins wrestler to whom he had lost,  7-4, in the regular season. Swanson was defeated in the consolation final to place fourth.

More than a decade after becoming the first All-American in program history, Jason McLean is returning to Muhlenberg as head wrestling coach.
A 2001 graduate of Muhlenberg, McLean earned All-America honors by finishing eighth at 141 pounds at the NCAA Championships as a senior. He also won the Centennial Conference championship that year, finishing with a record of 34-11 â the second-most wins in a season in program history. McLean also went 28-10 and was the CC runner-up at 126 in 1998. He ended his career with a 71-31 record. "This opportunity to step in at the helm at Muhlenberg means the world to me," said McLean upon his hiring. "I am beyond appreciative of Corey Goff [director of athletics] and the Muhlenberg faithful for giving me this opportunity and look forward to the journey ahead."

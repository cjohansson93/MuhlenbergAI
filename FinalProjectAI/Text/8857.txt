Built in 1965, Benfer Hall offers a unique opportunity for upperclass men and women to live in a suite style arrangement for eight students. Each suite contains four bedrooms, one bath, a living room and a private entrance. Benfer has central air conditioning, and is coed by suite. It also has a laundry room. First year students are ineligible for Benfer openings.
The buildings are located on the hillside next to Benfer Hall and the Trexler Pavilion. They opened in January 2002. The configuration is 4 person suites. Each suite has 4 single bedrooms, a toilet room, a shower room, a 2-sink vanity, a common living room and galley kitchen. The kitchen contains a refrigerator, microwave and sink. There are 2 large recreational rooms with full kitchens, a television and a second floor mezzanine area.  Each set of eight suites share a spacious lounge area.  Both Robertson and South have spectacular views, overlooking Cedar Beach Park.

Elections 2018: The Politics of Urgency and Uncertainty 




Nonpartisan lecture and event series at Muhlenberg College addresses the issues surrounding midterm elections.


	 Tuesday, September 4, 2018  11:45 AM


On November 6, 2018, Americans will elect 435 members of the House of Representatives; 35 U.S. Senators; 39 governors; 6,070 state legislators; and thousands of mayors, city council members, school board members and township commissioners.
In a national political context in which politics is anything but usual, few midterm elections have seemed as urgent or as uncertain. Join the Muhlenberg College community for a series of speakers and events, both before and after the midterm elections, that will address the following questions and more:
How and to what extent will the election be a referendum on the Trump presidency? What will the elections of 2018 reveal about the current state of American political parties and the ideological polarization between liberals and conservatives? How will issues such as race, immigration, national security, trade, reproductive rights and gun control inform the political debate and shape votersâ choices at the polls? What forcesâinterest groups, money, the media, ideologyâhave the great potential to shape electoral outcomes whether in support of or opposition to democracy? How will the outcomes of the 2018 elections matter to national (and international) politics moving forward?
Unless otherwise noted, all Elections 2018 events are free and open to the public. For questions about the program, please contact Lanethea Mathews-Schultz, chair and professor of political science, at mathews@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3737. 
ALL IN Campus Democracy ChallengeOngoing Fall 2018
Muhlenberg College has joined hundreds of other colleges and universities for Civic Nationâs ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, which recognizes campuses that are committed to improving democratic engagement, increasing voter participation rates and graduating informed and active citizens. The Challenge at Muhlenberg links academic departments, offices of student affairs and student organizations, including âBergVotes, in collaborative efforts to increase meaningful campus dialogue, promote voter registration and mobilization and create a more inclusive democracy. The Challenge does not support or oppose candidates for public office or take positions with respect to political parties. Instead, it encourages active and informed democratic participation. For more information about how to get involved, contact Michele Deegan, professor of political science, at deegan@muhlenberg.edu.
Kristin Goss: Whatever Happened to the âMissing Movementâ?Gun Control Politics Over Two Decades of ChangeThursday, September 13Moyer Hall, Miller Forum, 7 p.m.
Gossâ work focuses on how everyday Americans participate in public lifeâwith a particular focus on guns, gender and givingâand why it matters. The Kevin D. Gorter Associate Professor of Public Policy and Political Science at Duke University, Goss is author of âThe Paradox of Gender Equality: How American Womenâs Groups Gained and Lost Their Public Voiceâ (University of Michigan Press, 2013) and âDisarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in Americaâ (Princeton University Press, 2006, 2009) and co-author of âThe Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Knowâ (Oxford University Press, 2014).

âCharlie vs. GoliathâFilm screening with post-film discussionFriday, September 28Seegers Union, Red Door, 2 p.m.
âCharlies vs. Goliathâ is a feature-length documentary about an ordinary manâs extraordinary struggle to shake up the political establishment. It would be hard to find a more unlikely candidate than Charlie Hardy, a penniless, 75-year-old former Catholic priest who spent nearly a decade serving the poor while living in a cardboard shack in a Venezuelan slum. Charlie returned to his hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming in 2011 and decided to run for office in 2014, winning the Democratic Partyâs nomination for the U.S. Senate. The film provides a portrait of this uniquely charismatic septuagenarian while revealing an inside look at a campaign fueled by hope rather than money. Challenging the belief that our political process is fair and democratic, âCharlie vs. Goliathâ explores the questions of how an honest and sincere person without money can make a difference running for public office, and more broadly, whether it is worth fighting an unbeatable foe and dreaming an impossible dream.

Dardaniâs research and teaching interests include law and society, constitutional law, critical race theory, U.S. government and American political thought. He studies how the SupremeCourt influences American politics, the manifold ways law matters to ordinary citizens and the societal forces that shape the U.S. legal system. He has a particular focus on how the Supreme Courtâs decisions involving race relations are influenced by the larger structural forces of U.S. society. A visiting assistant professor of political science at Muhlenberg, Dardani earned his B.A.   at SUNY New Paltz and his Ph.D. at the University of Connecticut in the fields of public law and political theory.

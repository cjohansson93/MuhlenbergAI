The Jewish Learning Fellowship (JLF) is a 10-week experiential, conversational PAID seminar for students looking to deepen their understanding of Judaism on their own terms. Weâre interested in asking big questions. You know, the big stuff â like Who am I? What communities am I a part of? What is worth committing myself to, and why? And we donât purport to have any of the big answers. 

We make no claims about the ârightâ way to practice or not to practice Judaism. Our job is to help you explore the tradition in a safe space and find your own place, on your terms, in Judaismâs Great Conversation.

Committee Members
The current Faculty Handbook (as of March 2022) refers to The Wescoe School; what is stated here aligns with the structure of Wescoe APCC described in the handbook, but is updated to reflect the changes that have occurred since the last time the Handbook was updated.
Membership includes four faculty elected by the faculty, up to three department chairs appointed by the Provost, and two students enrolled in one of the Division of Graduate and Continuing Education (one of whom must be from an undergraduate degree completion program and the other from a graduate program). The Provost, Vice President and Executive Director, Registrar, Dean of Graduate Studies, and Dean of Continuing Studies are ex officio members of the committee. Department chairs must be chosen from departments that contribute to degrees offered through the Division of Graduate and Continuing Education and elected faculty must have taught a course through the Division of Graduate and Continuing Education within the last two years. Elected faculty will serve staggered three-year terms. The chair of the committee will be chosen by the committee from among the elected faculty members of the committee at its first meeting of the academic year.

Frequently Asked Questions



          What is the history of the GCE APCC and when was it created?
  








The GCE APCC was established as a College committee approximately 25 years ago by the faculty. As the Muhlenberg Evening College programs and enrollments expanded in the 1980âs, placing increased demands on the Curriculum Committee (CC) and Academic Policy Committee (APC), the Evening College Academic Council (ECAC) was formed in the mid 1990âs. The ECAC â...provided a place for thorough discussion of Evening College proposals and activities between the Collegeâs faculty and administration and the Evening College. New proposals would have to pass faculty approval in the ECAC before they were brought to the floor of faculty meetings. The committee played a critical role in the inclusion of the Evening College under the umbrella of faculty governance. The first faculty members on the Council were Dr. George Heitmann, Dr. David Nelson, Dr. Franz Birgel, Dr. Donald Shive, and Dr. Alton Slane. The ECAC was an important addition to the College; over the years the membership of the ECAC changed, but it has remained a pillar of support and a place of debate and discussion about the adult student.â (100 Years of Adult Education at Muhlenberg College, 2009). Through several years of debate and refinement the ECAC was established and in 1999 renamed the Evening College Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee, in 2002 renamed the Wescoe School Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee, and most recently in 2020 renamed the Graduate and Continuing Education Academic Policy and Curriculum Committee (GCE APCC).






          How are new programs or curricular changes reviewed and approved?
  








New programs, courses, modules or other curricular changes follow the committeeâs guidelines for proposal. The faculty, program director, Dean or Department Chair will notify the GCE APCC of their intent at earliest convenience. Periodic updates are encouraged to keep the committee informed and allow the committee to provide advice as a proposal is being developed. A proposal is presented to the GCE APCC for review and discussion. Revisions may be requested. Following a favorable vote of the committee, the GCE APCC will present the petition with their recommendation to the faculty at the next full faculty meeting.






          Why is there a requirement to have recent teaching experience in GCE programs to serve on the GCE APCC?
  








Since establishing the ECAC (now GCE APCC) as a College committee it became increasingly evident to effectively serve the adult student first-hand experience and deep understanding of the adult student would be necessary. Understanding the nontraditional student is important to being able to effectively evaluate and advise in policy and curricular decisions that affect the programs designed to include them. Being a nontraditional student is not just about age but also their life circumstances. These circumstances may include any combination of being out of high school for more than 5 years, veteran or active duty service member, having a full- time career or other significant responsibilities such as supporting or having financial dependents, or they may already have a bachelorâs degree and now pursue additional education for career advancement or change. These life circumstances shape how they return to the classroom, bringing greater depth of lived experience, high motivation for learning, limited interest engaging in traditional campus co-curricular activities, extremely pragmatic and strategic in their approach to learning, expectations for responsive College services, support and knowledgeable career advising to name a few.

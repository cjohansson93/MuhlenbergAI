This story was updated on February 13, 2019.
The winner of the 2019 Best Choral Performance Grammy was The Crossing, an ensemble that part-time Voice Lecturer Alexandra Porter is part of, for McLoskey: Zealot Canticles. âI actually found out about the win from a friend who was also on the Zealot Canticles albumâshe posted about it on social media,â Porter says. âIt is an exciting win for the ensemble, and for the composer Lansing McCloskey. I'm very proud to have been part of the process and grateful that I can follow my passions as a career.â
Of the five nominated works in the category, two others were also tied to members of the College community: Director of Choral and Vocal Studies and Assistant Professor of Music Christopher Jackson and part-time Voice Lecturer Fiona Gillespie were nominated as part of the Skylark Vocal Ensemble for Seven Words From The Cross and part-time Voice Lecturer Jessica Beebe was nominated as part of the Clarion Choir for Kastalsky: Memory Eternal.
Nominees are selected by experts in the fieldâmusicians from all over the world whoâve been nominated in the past or whoâve done enough work to be considered expertsâso a nomination itself is a high honor. Jackson cites Muhlenbergâs proximity to both Philadelphia and New York City, which are hubs of choral music in the United States, as an advantage when it comes to attracting talented faculty and providing opportunities to students.
âFor us all to be nominated in the category of Best Choral Performance, it shows that we are out and doing quality work in our field, that we have a variety of experiences and flexibility and creativity in the instruction provided to our students,â Jackson says. âIn addition to being trained soloists, we are working at the top of the field of choral music.â

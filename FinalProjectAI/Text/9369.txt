The Shankweiler Scholars ProÂ­gram is designed for highly motivated undergraduates preparing to pursue a medical degree. As a reflection of Muhlenbergâs excellent health pro­fessions and liberal arts curriculum, the program is particularly well-suited for pre-medical students planning to major in the humanities or social sciences or those with broad intellectual interests planning to maÂ­jor in natural sciences.
âThe Shankweiler Scholars Program brings our strong history in pre-med together with our liberal arts mission to graduate well-rounded students. Itâs a natural fit.â
Muhlenberg President John Williams
âThe medical schools weâve spoken with want students who offer skills and interest in disciplines outside of the traditional sciences,â says President John Williams. âThe Shankweiler Scholars Program brings our strong history in pre-med toÂ­gether with our liberal arts mission to graduate well-rounded students. Itâs a natural fit.â
The honors program is named for John Shankweiler, a 1921 Muhlenberg alumnus and a renowned and beloved biology professor, remembered for his untiring advancement of the sciences and excellent teaching. Current faculty and staff continue this effort across the sciences, humanities and arts, and an interdisciplinary faculty advisory committee will provide students with mentorship and guidance throughout their Muhlenberg experience and the medical school application process.
Students accepted into the ShankÂ­weiler Scholars Program will receive a merit award and participate in a curriculum that supports the human dimensions of medical practice to complement the standard academic preparation for medical school. The Shankweiler Scholars Program will help position students for admisÂ­sion to leading U.S. medical schools, including Boston University School of Medicine and Temple UniversiÂ­ty School of Medicine, with which Muhlenberg has cooperative admisÂ­sions agreements.

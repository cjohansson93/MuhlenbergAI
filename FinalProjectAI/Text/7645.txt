Woods, Shulman, Schindler Win in Men's Tennis Tourney
 Sunday, September 14, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team opened the year by hosting its annual Mule Fall Classic and crowned one singles winner and one doubles winner.

Sophomore David Woods captured the No. 4 singles bracket, while the team of junior Neil Shulman and
freshman Mickey Schindler won at No. 3 doubles.

After rolling to a 6-0, 6-0 shutout in his semifinal match, Woods played a competitive final against an Oneonta State opponent and pulled out
a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 win. Woods’ win prevented Oneonta from sweeping all six singles flights.

Shulman and Schindler, playing together for the first time, won their two matches with relative ease, both 8-1
against duos from Drew and Moravian.

Schindler had an impressive Mule debut all around, reaching the No. 6 singles final before falling in three sets. Shulman (left) 
recorded a 6-0, 6-0 shutout in the No. 5 singles third-place match.

All six Muhlenberg players who competed won at least one match. Senior Eric Chavis finished third at No. 3 singles
and at No. 2 doubles with Woods. The No. 1 doubles team of senior Daniel Lakhman and junior Max Blumenthal lost a close
match in the final.

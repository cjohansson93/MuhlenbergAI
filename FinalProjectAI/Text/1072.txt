Campus Update: Healthcare Community Partnership, March 30
Monday, March 30, 2020

Dear Colleagues,
Iâm writing to share information that was just sent to students. As the COVID-19 virus has begun to impact our campus, we have worked closely with local public health officials and organizations. Since we have moved to remote learning and work status, the number of local cases has continued to increase. As you have likely seen in the news, the health of emergency and healthcare personnelâand their familiesâis critical to helping those who contract the virus. As such, we have recognized the need to offer our support however we can. We first did this by donating supplies and equipment to our local hospitals from our students, academic programs, labs, health center and campus safety areasâfor which they were very appreciative.
Following Governor Wolfâs addition of Lehigh County to the stay-at-home order, Allentown Emergency Services as well as local healthcare providers have reached out to Muhlenberg asking about the availability of some of our housing options to help them house personnel in order to meet community needs. On the surface, this seems like an easy decision. As an institution, we are committed to being active, thoughtful partners in helping to maintain the strength, health and vibrancy of Allentown. But the decision is a complicated one. We understand that, as a result of the students leaving for what was initially a temporary move off campus, most of our studentsâ belongings remain in their rooms. I use the term âtheir roomsâ because we know that to our students, these rooms are their home.
In considering how we can balance the need to help our community and respect our studentsâ personal space, we have developed a plan that will notify students if their residence hall is needed for this community emergency support. They will receive detailed information about how their belongings will be packed and how they can pick them up once we are able to allow people on campus. Belongings will be packed by College employees who will receive training and instruction for carrying out the task with as much empathy, discretion and care as possible. The process will be one that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees, as well. While our recent communication about retrieving personal belongings indicated a charge for packing, under these conditions there will be no charges and pick-up of items, if the student is able, will be curbside when State guidelines allow.
We understand that some students may have items in their rooms not allowed through our housing policies. We plan to exercise amnesty for items such as alcohol and marijuana to the fullest extent possible. While these items will not be returned, students will not face judicial violations as a result. There are other details and answers to potential questions that were shared with students in trying to provide some sense of clarity for a difficult circumstance.
Additional preparations are being made in the event that Allentown Emergency Services needs to use Memorial Hall. We had received an initial request for use of the facility, but that request was put on hold for the time being. We are moving forward with the understanding that the space may eventually need to be used.
I am committed to ensuring that our College community remains up-to-date on changes at the College as we navigate this global health crisis. We will continue to do our best in making decisions that are both in keeping with our institutional values and mission and that prioritize the health and safety of all members of our campus and local community. As always, please take care of yourself and your families during this challenging time.
Sincerely,
Kathleen E. HarringInterim President

Process for Requesting Reasonable Accommodations

âMuhlenberg College values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational opportunity for all of its students. Muhlenberg College is fully committed to complying with all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (as amended 2008), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and to a policy of ensuring that all qualified students with disabilities have full access to programs, activities, and services and are provided opportunities and reasonable accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services to ensure this access. The Office of Disability Services facilitates access to programs and activities, coordinates auxiliary aids and services, provides access to assistive technology, and when necessary, advocates on behalf of students with members of the campus community.
Students with disabilities requesting accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services at Muhlenberg College must complete a multifaceted process and be approved prior to the development of an Accommodation Plan. Students with conditions that may rise to the level of a disability must provide appropriate, comprehensive, and current documentation that outlines the need for the specific college-level accommodations. Documentation must identify the diagnosed condition, present evidence of the conditionâs impact on a major life activity, and provide a history of previously used accommodations and services.
All requests for accommodations are individually reviewed using a collaborative approach after the determination process is complete. Once accommodations are approved, an Accommodation Plan is developed which the student presents to the faculty member. Accommodation Plans are developed each semester at the studentâs request.

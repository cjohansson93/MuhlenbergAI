First Outdoor Meet Worth the Wait for Throwers
 Saturday, March 30, 2013 - page 3







					 




 
  
Junior Scott Reutter placed seventh in the long jump.

 

Over the last few weeks, spring athletes have been waiting for the warmer weather to arrive. It did on the last Saturday in March, which also marked the end of an even longer period of anticipation for some of those athletes.

The javelin and discus throwers on the Muhlenberg track and field team began practice with their teammates last fall but did not get a chance to compete in their events until the start of the outdoor season, at Lafayette’s 7-Way Invitational.

And they made the most of their chance.

Sophomore Tyler Bauer broke an 11-year-old school record in the javelin, coming in fourth in a meet that featured mostly Division I and II athletes with a throw of 198-3. The 2012 Centennial Conference champion surpassed his previous best by almost eight feet and qualified for the ECAC and IC4A championships.

Freshman Jordan Rosenthal, in the first meet of his college career, threw the javelin 175 feet, landing at No. 9 on the all-time performance list.

On the women’s side, freshman Jessica Thimmel, who competed in the shot put indoors, tied one of the oldest entries in the school record book with an ECAC-qualifying distance of 119-6 in the discus. The record was originally set in 1989.

The throwers highlighted an outstanding first meet for the Mules. In addition to Bauer and Thimmel, seniors Samantha Mayden (800 and 1500) and Erica Bash (1500) posted ECAC-qualifying marks. Mayden won the 1500 by more than three seconds.

Two members of the women’s team made the top 10 on the performance list in the 100 hurdles – junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski (seventh) and freshman Katrina Faust (10th). Another freshman, Ashley Riley, recorded the seventh-best triple jump in team history.

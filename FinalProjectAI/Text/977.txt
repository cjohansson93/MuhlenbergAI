The best reason to apply Early Decision is this: You have found a college that is an absolute first choice. You know that itâs the right fit. If Muhlenberg is that college, then please do apply Early Decision. Early Decision candidates should complete the Common Application and select "Early Decision" (ED I) or "Early Decision II" (ED II) as their preferred admission plan in the Muhlenberg questions. Our ED I deadline is November 15 and our ED II deadline is February 1. Admissions decisions will be sent online to ED I candidates in mid-December and ED II candidates between February 15 - 28. Students who are applying to one of our academic partnerships programs must submit additional documents.

Below are directions that we hope will help you in the application process, but as always, we are here to help so please feel invited to contact us, with any questions you may have, at 484-664-3200.












          Visit if you can.
  








We strongly encourage a campus visit to interview and tour. The interview can be an important opportunity to explore âthe fitâ between you and Muhlenberg. It can also be a chance to develop a relationship with an admissions counselor who can then act as an advocate for you. Remember, if you are applying for one of our academic partnerships, you are required to have an admissions interview.






          Complete the Common Application.
  








You may apply online. Note that a $50 application fee is required unless this would present a significant financial hardship for your family or you qualify for an institutional fee waiver. If you have additional questions about our fee waiver policy, please contact us directly at 484-664-3245.






          Select Early Decision I (ED I) or Early Decision II (ED II) as your preferred admission plan on the Common Application online.
  








The Muhlenberg-specific questions on the Common Application online allow students to indicate their preferred admission plan (Early Decision, Early Decision II or Regular Decision). Sometimes students later change their mind about their preferred admission plan. If that happens, please use this Early Decision Agreement Form.Regular Decision applicants may change their application to EDII by submitting the Early Decision Agreement Form through February 15. This option is designed for students, who decide Muhlenberg is their first choice after February 1, to be able to indicate their strong desire to enroll.






          Have your counselor and one teacher provide recommendations.
  








Your recommenders can either send their recommendations through the Common Application online or by downloading the forms on the Common Application website and sending them directly to the Office of Admissions.






          Ask your high school counselor to send an official transcript and keep us updated on your academic performance.
  








Your transcript will complete your application, but please be sure that grade reports for each quarter or marking period are sent to Admissions as they become available throughout your senior year. For the Mid Year Report, your counselor can send either through the Common Application online or by downloading the form on the Common Application website and sending it directly to the Office of Admissions.






          If you're choosing to submit your ACT or SAT scores.
  








ACT or SAT scores can be self-reported on your Common Application or you may submit a copy of score reports via email to: admissions@muhlenberg.edu. If you submit scores through any of the testing agencies, Muhlenberg test codes are: SAT, 2424 and ACT, 3640. If you ultimately enroll at Muhlenberg, and you have self-reported your test scores as part of your application, you will be required to submit official test scores from either the test agency or from your counselor.






          If youâre choosing not to submit your ACT or SAT scores.
  








Respond accordingly to the preferred testing plan question on the Common Application. You may also indicate this by completing the Test-Optional Form. While test scores are optional for admissions, students must submit test scores to be considered for Academic Partnerships.






          Check for missing application materials and your admissions decision in your application status portal.
  








Once your application is received, you will receive an email with directions on how to access this page. You may access your application status portal here.






          Financial Aid
  








We pledge to all Early Decision applicants that we will treat them fairly for financial aid and we will run early need-based and merit aid processes so that students admitted Early Decision know about financial aid before they are required to deposit. In order to hear about need-based aid as quickly as possible after an Early Decision acceptance, please file a FAFSA and Muhlenberg College Scholarship and Aid Application within a week of applying to Muhlenberg. These documents will become available on October 1.
If you wish to be considered for merit aid only, you are not required to submit financial aid paperwork. View more here.






          What is your commitment?
  








If you are admitted Early Decision, youâre expected to withdraw other applications and enroll at Muhlenberg. This is a promise you should take seriously.

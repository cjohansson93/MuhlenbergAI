Soccer Teams to See Red (Devils)



Both Muhlenberg soccer teams were awaiting the results of the first-round matches to know who they would be playing in the semifinals of the CC playoffs at Varsity Field this weekend. 

The answer was the same for both: Dickinson.

The Dickinson men defeated Franklin & Marshall, 2-0, and will face Muhlenberg on Friday at 7:00. The Mules won the regular-season meeting, 1-0.

The Dickinson women needed a goal with less than 10 minutes left in regulation to tie Swarthmore, 1-1, then went on to win in penalty kicks, 5-4. The Red Devils handed the Mules their lone CC loss of the season, 4-1 back on Oct. 3. The rematch is slated for Saturday at 1:00.



The Muhlenberg volleyball team’s season came to an end with a 3-1 loss to Swarthmore in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The fifth-seeded 



Lee finished her career just short of 1,000 digs (987).



Mules (11-13) quieted a rowdy Swarthmore crowd in the first set, cruising to a 25-15 win. Freshman Bryn Baker opened the match with an ace, and Muhlenberg jumped out to an early 7-1 lead behind back-to-back kills by senior Brittany Williams, a block by sophomore Davi Gordon and freshman Jennifer Seeba and an ace by senior Phylicia Lee.

The lead grew 

to 14-5 with a Seeba kill, and leading 21-14, the Mules took four of the next five points, winning the set on a Lee kill.

Muhlenberg stayed hot to open the second set, jumping out to a 5-1 lead with a block by sophomore Jackie Price. But Swarthmore (19-9) fought back, eventually taking a 12-8 lead. The Mules got to as close as 20-19, but the Garnet took five of the last six points to tie the match at one set apiece.

Swarthmore built big leads early in the third and fourth sets to pick up the win. The Garnet jumped out 11-4 in the third and 7-0 in the fourth en route to wins of 25-12 and 25-18.

Williams led the Mules with 11 kills and added 14 digs. Gordon had a team-high 16 digs to go along with nine kills, and Baker concluded her record-setting freshman season with 26 assists. Seeba recorded a match-high five blocks.

Basketball Teams Head Toward Last Week with Playoffs in Sight

On the second-to-last Wednesday of the regular season, both Muhlenberg basketball teams took to the court under very different circumstances, looking to solidify their Centennial Conference playoff chances.

The women, playing at home against winless Bryn Mawr, won for the second time in as many days, 71-39. The 




Senior Kimberly Mui made her first career start and scored two points.



men traveled to defending CC runner-up Dickinson and lost, 79-60, but are still squarely in the midst of the playoff picture.

The women have never lost to Bryn Mawr, and it was clear early on that the streak wasn’t going to 
end this time. The Mules scored the first 14 points of the game and led 33-8 with five minutes left in the first half. They shot 57 percent in the first 20 minutes, went into the locker room with a 41-15 lead, and cruised from there.

Muhlenberg (17-5, 12-5) is tied with Ursinus for third place in the CC, two games behind Johns Hopkins (14-3), which lost at McDaniel. Franklin & Marshall (13-4) is sandwiched in between. The Mules can clinch a playoff berth with a win in one of their final three games.

Junior Alita Zabrecky led the team with 14 points in only 13 minutes of playing time, and senior Alexandra Chili added 11. Freshman Emily Lesher tied her career high with eight points.

All 17 Muhlenberg players had at least one point or assist, and none 




Liddic scored 10 of his 16 points from the foul line and also blocked three shots.



played more than 18 minutes.

The Mules turned the ball over only five times, their fewest since a five-turnover game against Washington College last year, and blocked 11 shots, one off the school record. Senior Kathleen Naddaff led the way with three swats.

The second straight game for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team against 
one of last season’s CC finalists did not got nearly as well as the first.

Second-place Dickinson used a strong second-half run to blow the game open and snap the Mules’ four-game winning streak, 79-60. The loss drops Muhlenberg (14-8, 8-7) into sole possession of fifth place with three games – all against teams in the bottom half of the standings – left in the regular season.

With a 16-point, 10-rebound game, senior Spencer Liddic broke the CC records for career rebounds (957) and double-doubles (42), which he tied in Saturday’s win against Franklin & Marshall. Liddic also moved into ninth place on the conference all-time scoring list with 1,631 points.

The Red Devils (13-9, 10-5) led by six at the break. Muhlenberg got to within four at the 13:59 mark of the second half, but Dickinson used a 31-10 run to put the game out of reach.

Freshman Malique Killing tied Liddic for the team lead with 16 points. Sophomore James Albano had his best game of the season, tying his career high with nine points to go along with six rebounds and a career-high three blocks.

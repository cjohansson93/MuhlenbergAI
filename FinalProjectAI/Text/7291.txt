Women's Basketball Falls at Gettysburg
 Saturday, February 8, 2014 - page 3







					 




Little went right for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team in a 63-50 setback at Gettysburg.

The Mules shot 26 percent from the field against the team ranked seventh in Division III in field-goal percentage defense, making a season-low 13 field goals and committing 31 turnovers in losing on the road for the second time in four days. With the setback, Muhlenberg (12-9, 9-6) dropped into fifth place in the Centennial Conference standings, while the Bullets (14-6, 9-5) jumped into fourth with their fifth straight victory. 

Muhlenberg stills hold a two-game advantage on Swarthmore for the league’s final playoff spot with three games to play.

Junior Leanna Tallamy (11 points, 11 rebounds) and senior Erin Laney (10 points, 10 rebounds) 
notched double-doubles for the Mules, and junior Abby Stenger (right) made all three of the Mules’ three-pointers en route to an 11-point afternoon. 



Wrestling Blanked Twice


The Muhlenberg wrestling team forfeited eight classes and lost Merchant Marine and Johns Hopkins by the same 55-0 score.

Freshman Jaryd Flank lost two close bouts, including a 7-5 decision to a Hopkins opponent who is the defending Centennial
Conference champion and is currently ranked third in Division III.

Despite its struggles, Muhlenberg found itself within striking distance until the final minute, thanks in large part to a sizeable disparity in free-throw success. Led by Tallamy (9-for-10), the Mules made 17 of their first 18 foul shots before falling off late, while Gettysburg finished just 17-of-35 (49 percent) at the line, allowing its opponent to hang around for the vast majority of the second half. 

Muhlenberg closed the first half on an 8-0 run, pulling to within 27-22 at the break despite making just five field goals. Gettysburg, however, took control right back after intermission, starting the second half on an 8-2 spurt to regain a double-digit advantage just over two minutes into the period. The lead eventually reached 14 before the Mules made their move, closing to within 55-49 on a jumper by Laney with three minutes remaining. Muhlenberg, however, managed only a free throw the rest of the way.

Sophomore Christina Santone was effective down low in the second half, grabbing a career-high eight rebounds and blocking a shot in just 10 minutes of action.

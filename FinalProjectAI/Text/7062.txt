Women’s Soccer Needs Win in Finale


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team gave up three second-half goals and lost to Ursinus, 3-0, in its second-to-last Centennial Conference game of the regular season.

Despite dropping into sixth place, the Mules (6-9-1, 4-5) can still clinch a CC playoff berth with a win against Bryn Mawr in their home finale next Saturday. Muhlenberg, with 12 points, currently trails McDaniel (15) and Dickinson (14), who play each other next Saturday. If the Mules beat Bryn Mawr (2-13, 0-8), they would have 15 points, and they would win the tiebreaker against either McDaniel or Dickinson, since they defeated both.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team geared up for an important final week of the regular season by splitting a pair of matches at the E-town October Classic. The Mules (18-9) overcame a 2-0 deficit to force a fifth set before dropping the opener to host Elizabethtown but rebounded to sweep Penn State Altoona in the consolation match.

Junior Nikki Dickson (left) recorded 20 assists to surpass the 1,000-assist milestone for her career. With 1,017, she is the eighth player in program history to reach quadruple digits.

Sophomore Joanne Josephson had 10 blocks in the opening match to become the second Mule this season with a double-digit block match. Prior to classmate Katherine Boll doing it against Haverford, it had not happened since 1997. Josephson’s 82 blocks this season rank seventh on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

Freshman Allison Glass (14 kills) and sophomore Chelsea Kaser (25 digs) also put up big numbers in the Elizabethtown match. Glass additionally served up four aces to become the seventh Mule with 50 in a season and was behind the service line when Muhlenberg cut a 24-14 deficit to 24-23 before finally dropping the second set. 

Josephson led the attack with nine kills against Penn State Altoona, while Boll had seven kills and six blocks. Freshman Ali Mayer added 16 assists and four aces.

Muhlenberg closes out the regular season with Centennial Conference matches against Franklin & Marshall and Swarthmore and a non-CC match against Moravian this week. If the Mules win both of their CC contests, they will host the conference playoffs.

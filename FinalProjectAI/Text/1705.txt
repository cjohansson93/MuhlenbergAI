Nestled in charming west Allentown, within Pennsylvania’s blossoming Lehigh Valley, the compact and picturesque campus at Muhlenberg College offers a flexible range of spaces to host your company or organization. 
 Venues throughout the campus can accommodate anywhere from two to 475 guests in a location thatâs easily accessible from Route 22, Interstate 78 and the Pennsylvania Turnpikeâs Northeast Extension. Ample parking is available in on-campus lots as well as through meter-free adjacent street parking.

Campus dining services, which often ranks as the best in Pennsylvania and among the top 20 in the nation, can provide event catering on-site, with the ability to meet specific dietary needs. Muhlenberg has two kosher kitchens and a fully-integrated kosher dining service, among the first of its kind on a college campus.
Muhlenbergâs on-site Red Door Catering service can also help reduce bar service costs for events with clients purchasing their own alcohol and paying only a nominal fee for bartender service. 



Whether your organization is searching for a place to host a corporate retreat, banquet or company-wide training session, Muhlenbergâs venue variety is sure to include the right fit. During the summer months, Muhlenberg frequently partners with companies to provide a low-cost housing option for summer interns.
For information regarding holding an external event on campus, phone our Conference Manager at 484-664-3810.
For summer day or residential conference requests, please complete the summer conference external program application.

The venue really was exactly what we needed, and the food—always an issue, even when people tell you otherwise—was excellent.

Your professional attention made a very large, very popular event that was planned relatively last-minute, completely smooth and manageable.

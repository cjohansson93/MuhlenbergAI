This event is free and open to the public.
Spiegelman, who is known as a comic, writer, and graphic artist, is well-known as creator of the Pulitzer Prize-winner of his comic book memoir Maus (1997). In 2005, Time Magazine named him as one of “Top 100 Most Influential People.”
Born in Stockholm, Sweden, Speigelman immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a small child. As a teenager, Spiegelman enjoyed cartoons and drawing in his spare time. He became a member of the underground comic movement in his late-teens and went on to produce a variety of graphic art projects. His book of comics received special mention on the cover of the New Yorker Magazine, as a revitalization of his desire to draw and write, after the September 11th attacks. His book, In the Shadow of No Towers, depicting moments and political jargon about the attacks, earned him this placement on the cover of the magazine.
Spiegelman’s appearance is a part of Living Writers, a semester-long series of public readings. A future reading will be given by Alan Michael Parker.
Established in 1994, “Living Writers” is a course offered once every three years which brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening. Each writer is interviewed on the college’s radio station. Their visit is a community event. Past participants have included David Sedaris, Jonathan Franzen, Gary Snyder, Adrienne Rich, Francine Prose, Galway Kinnell, Robert Pinsky, Michael Ondaatje and Phillip Levine.

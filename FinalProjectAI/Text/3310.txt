turf replacement nears completion


Work on Frank Marino Field continued at a feverish pace over the weekend, with more dramatic results. The project is expected to be completed in time for Friday night’s field hockey game vs. Hartwick.

The turf as it looked on Labor Day morning.

The Mule is looking much healthier than it did on June 7,
at the start of the turf replacement project.

Field markings for other sports (blue for field hockey, red for women’s
lacrosse, yellow for men’s lacrosse) are visible in the east end zone (top). In the west end zone, grooves are cut into the green turf so turf of the 
appropriate color can be installed (bottom).

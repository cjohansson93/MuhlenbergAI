The following examples are community engagement opportunities facilitated by the Office of Community Engagement and intentionally designed to engage students with a reflection of what community engagement means to them, its impacts and its challenges.







Student Staff
The Office of Community Engagement oversees a significant number of work-study students each year. We have approximately 35 students on our staff and each member works with a specific team in the office in addition to 1-2 community-based organizations with which they want to work on a weekly basis. 







Civic Fellows
The program is structured to provide student participants with a community leadership experiencethat expands upon their current involvement. Student participants in Civic Fellows will each work with a community-based organization on a weekly basis. Civic Fellows will also participate in a weekly non-credit course that encourages them to think critically about community engagement, engage with other student leaders and gain skills needed to work effectively in communities.









OCE Student Coordinators
All of the community programs run through the Office of Community Engagement are overseen by student coordinators. Students recruit volunteers, orient them to programs and sites, assist them with clearances if necessary, take attendance, problem solve, create plans and more in collaboration with the OCE. 

 







Community Internship Program 
Funded by Air Products, the community internship program allows students to work in paid internships with local community non-profit organizations and schools. In the spring semester, students can apply for a 325-hour internship over the summer and receive a stipend of $3100. Community partner organizations apply to host students as interns, and students apply to those internships they feel best fit their skills and interests. The Career Center accepts student applications through Handshake.










Alliances for Justice Active Leadership (AJAL) Retreat- OCE & Multicultural Life
Students come together for a weekend of reflection and deep engagement with the work of social justice grounded in dialogue. AJAL is intended to encourage intentional conversations across, amongst and about communities of difference here at Muhlenberg College, in Allentown and in your future communities. The program mobilizes dialogue as a catalyst for reflection and a method of change movements. The conversations which are central to the program can bring up difficult questions about an individualâs personal identity, biases and stereotypes, as well as, delve into controversial topics and themes.

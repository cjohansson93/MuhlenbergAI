Men's Lacrosse, Baseball Fall on Senior Day
 Saturday, April 28, 2012 - page 2







					 





In addition to his record faceoff wins and ground balls, Rispoli dished out two assists.  




The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team closed the curtain on its 2012 season by honoring its seniors, one of whom had a historic night.

The Mules suffered their 11th straight loss, 14-11 to Haverford, despite an outstanding performance in the X by Nick Rispoli. The senior co-captain went 21-for-26 on faceoffs, breaking the previous school record of 18 faceoff wins in a game. In the process, he became Muhlenberg’s all-time leader with 240 career wins. Rispoli also picked up 19 ground balls, shattering the old mark of 14.

The Mules trailed 14-4 early in the fourth quarter before rallying to make things interesting. They scored the final seven goals of the game for their biggest offensive quarter since netting eight in the first against Moravian in 2010.

The goals came in bunches – three in 52 seconds, two in seven seconds, and two in 12 seconds – many off of Rispoli faceoff wins. But after the final goal, with 3:47 left, the Fords won the ensuing faceoff and ran out the clock. 

Jon Thomas scored a career-high four goals in the last game of his freshman season. He finished with 17 goals, the most by a Muhlenberg freshman since 2008.

The Muhlenberg baseball team was swept by Washington, 6-1 and 5-3, on Senior Day.

After Brian Beck, Nick Busillo and Mike Speroni were honored for their contributions to the program during a ceremony between games, the Mules outhit the Shoremen 10-5 in the nightcap. But four errors turned into three unearned runs, making a tough-luck loser out of freshman Matthew Lawsky.

After giving up four runs (two earned) and four hits in the first three innings, Lawsky relied primarily on his fastball to surrender just one hit and allow one unearned run the rest of the way. 




Freshman David Anderson turns one of Muhlenberg’s two double plays in game 1.   




Muhlenberg cut into the 4-0 hole when juniors John Muha and Jimmy Aramanda hit identical leadoff doubles to the left-center game and then came around to score in the sixth and seventh, respectively.

After Washington tacked on an insurance run in the eighth, the Mules got the potential tying run to the plate in the ninth when freshman Kurt Johnson pick up his second RBI of the day on a double to left center. But the Shoremen got a fielder’s choice and a popup to end the game.

The three doubles gives Muhlenberg 100 extra-base hits for just the fifth time in program history. The Mules are just three shy of the school record of 103 achieved in 2008.

Freshman Chris Manfredonia singled in the sixth inning of game 1 and added two more hits in the nightcap to extend his school-record hitting streak to 22 games.

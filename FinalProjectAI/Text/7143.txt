Volleyball, Women's Soccer, Field Hockey Defeated
 Wednesday, October 30, 2013







					 






Gambocurta (12) and Kaser (right) combined for 29 digs.




Looking to take control of the Centennial Conference playoff race, the Muhlenberg volleyball team came up a little short at undefeated Franklin and Marshall, suffering a 3-1 defeat.

The Mules (18-10, 7-2) could have had the inside track to hosting the conference playoffs with a victory. Instead, they’ll have to defeat Swarthmore on Saturday to clinch a bye into the semifinals. The Diplomats (10-0, 23-4) will host the tournament.

Junior Lindsey Gambocurta had eight kills, six digs, four blocks and two aces for Muhlenberg, which staved off multiple set points in all four sets. The Mules erased four in the first set before F&M edged out a 27-25 decision, and fought off two before evening the match with a 29-27 victory in the second set. They saved four in the third set, but the Diplomats had already assumed a sizeable advantage and posted a 25-19 result. Muhlenberg then shook off four match points before F&M closed out its perfect CC regular season with a 27-25 win in the fourth set.

Sophomore Vanessa Pulice turned in a double-double with 21 assists and 10 digs for the Mules, while classmate Sarah Weyhmuller led the way with nine kills. Fellow sophomore Katherine Boll finished with six kills and assisted on a team-high seven blocks. Freshman Allison Glass added eight kills, and sophomore co-captain Chelsea Kaser contributed 23 digs.

A quick start by  women’s soccer fell by the wayside as Moravian dug out of an early deficit and scored 24 seconds into overtime to post a 2-1 victory.

Freshman Courtney Simon gave the Mules (6-10-1) the lead just seven minutes into the game, scoring her first collegiate goal on a volley off a headed ball by junior Audrey Zamichow (left), who recorded the first assist of her career. But Moravian found an equalizer in the 57th minute and needed little time after regulation to net the Golden Goal that put the Matte Award contest to bed.

With the victory, Moravian seized a 3-2 lead in the annual all-sports competition. The next scheduled contest is a volleyball match at Muhlenberg on Saturday.   



Senior goalie Amanda Wong made seven saves for the Mules, who didn’t allow a shot until the 25th minute but still found themselves on the wrong end of a 16-8 disparity in that category. Muhlenberg managed just three shots on goal, and only one after halftime. 

Despite losing their fourth straight game, the Mules can still clinch a spot in the Centennial Conference playoffs for the second straight year with a victory over 2-13 Bryn Mawr on Saturday.

Field hockey took on a nationally ranked opponent for the second straight game. This one didn’t go as well, with No. 19 Drew rolling to a 6-1 victory.

Freshman Rachel Strow got the Mules (8-8) on the board with just over three minutes remaining, tipping in a blast by junior Kayleigh Thies. The goal was the second of Strow’s career, with Thies collecting her eighth assist of the season.

Senior Ashley DeAngelis recorded her fourth defensive save of the year for Muhlenberg, which was fresh off a come-from-behind, 3-2 upset of 15th-ranked Ursinus over the weekend. It was the 17th of her career, placing her all alone in second on the program’s all-time list.

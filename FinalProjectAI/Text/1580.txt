Muhlenberg College violinist and teacher, Paul Windt, will present a recital at Egner Memorial Chapel on April 8 at 8 p.m. Michael Sheadel of Philadelphia, Pa., will be at the piano. The recital is free and open to the public. 
Windt's yearly Muhlenberg recitals have been hailed by the Morning Call as “among the supreme joys of the Valley music scene."
Included on the program will be sonatas by Beethoven and Fauré and the intensely powerful "Sonata No. 1" by twentieth century Swiss composer, Ernest Bloch.
The 130 th anniversary of the birth of violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler will be commemorated by a performance of his brilliant "Recitative and Scherzo" for violin alone.
Several transcriptions by the famed violinist, Jaschua Heifetz will close the recital. Included will be two of the most popular, the traditional " Deep River" and "Hora Staccato" by Dinicu.
The recital will also mark the occasion of Windt's first public performance on a violin made for him by master Philadelphia maker Steven Keller. The instrument is based on the Stradivari masterpiece, "Le Mesie".

track teams do seriously well at home meet





Senior Matt Boland won the javelin with a personal-best throw of 166-2.





Two seniors running at home for the last time exchange the baton as Lynch (right) hands off to Mentrikoski for the anchor leg of the 4x400.



It could have been a case of life imitating art.

The back page of the April Fools’ Day edition of the Muhlenberg Weekly, which came out on Thursday, led with the headline “Alex Faust shatters yet another motherf%$@)^* record.” In the story, Faust straps on an astronaut helmet and pole vaults over the moon.

Faust didn’t break any records, and she didn’t pole vault into orbit, but she and her teammates on the Muhlenberg track and field teams had a pretty good day at the Muhlenberg Invitational.

The Mules combined for 17 first-place finishes in the 10-team meet, with Faust contributing to four of them (100 meters, 200 meters, 4x400 relay and pole vault). 

Senior Jennifer Lynch hit the NCAA provisional mark in the 1,500 meters, crossing the finish line in 4:36.98 and improving her personal best by more than a second-and-a-half. She also ran on the 4x400 relay team.

Junior Bobby Torphy, described in the spoof as using “his biochemical prowess to cure cancer while running a 2-minute mile,” had three firsts, in the 800, 4x400 and 1,500. In the latter race, he didn’t run a 2-minute mile, but he did break four minutes in the nearest metric equivalent for the first time.

Other multiple-event winners included sophomore Marc Brookland (long jump, triple jump), senior Janelle Mentrikoski (400 hurdles, 4x400) and freshman Amanda Brennan (100 hurdles, long jump).

And while the Mule athletes didn’t break any school records, Mother Nature did by giving Muhlenberg a beautiful day for its home meet, which traditionally has been contested in cold weather and/or rain.

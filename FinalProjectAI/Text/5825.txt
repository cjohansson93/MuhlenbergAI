FANS TO SELECT TOP WOMEN’S TEAM


In conjunction with Muhlenberg’s celebration of the 50th year of co-education, alumni and fans will decide the top women’s sports team in College history. Voting will be conducted online from late October through mid-March, with the winner announced during 50th Anniversary of Co-Education Celebration Weekend (March 28-30, 2008).

Which was better - a record-setting basketball team or a nationally ranked softball team? A field hockey team that made the NCAAs or a track and field team that won a conference championship? You make the call!

Teams will be pitted one against the other, tournament-style, as indicated in the bracket, until the field of 24 is pared down to one: the top women’s sports team in Muhlenberg history. 

Contests will begin every Sunday, with the voting to run for a week. Results and profiles of teams will be accessible from the contest home page.

Of the 24 teams in the bracket, 20 have been chosen. To round out the field, we are asking voters to pick the last four teams. Click here for the candidates. The top four vote-getters as of Sunday, October 14, will be placed into the bracket in the “Voters’ Choice” spots.

As we collect your votes during the year, we would also like to collect your memories of the teams in the bracket. Tell us things that the history books and statistics don’t. What was it like to play on the team, or to be a fan of it? What were the best moments from the season? E-mail your comments to falk@muhlenberg.edu or fill in the box on the voting page; selected recollections will be published on the Web site throughout the course of the contest.

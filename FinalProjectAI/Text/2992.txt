mckeon wins weikert award



Muhlenberg junior Kelly McKeon received the Sidney G. Weikert Sophomore Athlete of the Year Award for her performance 
during the 2008-09 academic year at halftime of yesterday’s Homecoming football game.

The annual award recognizes athletic achievement with accompanying campus contribution and 


strong academic record. It was established in 1973 by the Muhlenberg College Alumni Association in memory of the late Sidney G. Weikert, a loyal alumnus and former 
associate director of admissions at Muhlenberg. 

At left, McKeon receives the award from Muhlenberg College President Randy Helm and his wife, Pat Helm.

McKeon led the Mule women’s basketball team to back-to-back Centennial Conference championships as the starting point guard in her first two seasons.
She averaged 12.4 points, 4.97 assists and, incredibly for a 5-6 point guard, a team-leading 8.5 rebounds per game as a sophomore, when she was
selected to the All-CC first team. 
McKeon was ninth in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio in 2008-09. She was at her best down the stretch, averaging 16.3 points, 10.0 rebounds and 5.7 assists while 
shooting 49.0 percent from the field and 82.3 percent from the line in the last nine games to lead Muhlenberg to its first NCAA “Sweet 16” appearance.

As a freshman, McKeon averaged 10.3 points and led the team in assists (104, a school record for a freshman) and steals (50).  

A four-time CC player of the week, McKeon has a record of 35-2 against CC opposition as starting point guard. After only two seasons, she ranks sixth in team history
with 253 career assists.

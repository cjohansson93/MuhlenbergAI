Language students are uniquely situated to take on the challenges and opportunities that globalization offers, able to understand, appreciate, and critically analyze the perspectives of cultures other than their own. Hebrew Language courses offer students the opportunity to acquire or advance communication skills in the Hebrew language, with a focus on Italian literature, culture, and society. The classroom experience is complemented by extensive use of the LC Commons, a state-of-the-art technological facility that provides software and other instructional material, as well as Dish International TV and SCOLA programming for student use in support of their program of study.
Note: Although students may not major or minor in Hebrew at this time, Hebrew language courses may be used to satisfy the College's Language Requirement.

Gill Goal Sparks Field Hockey to Win vs. Moravian
 Wednesday, October 10, 2012

The Muhlenberg field hockey team may not have many players on its bench, but all it takes is one to create a spark.

Sophomore Meghan Gill broke a scoreless tie with her first career goal late in the first half, opening the floodgates for what would become a 5-0 win against Moravian.

The victory gave Muhlenberg a 2-1 lead in the 2012-13 Matte Award standings. The next Matte contest is a women’s soccer game at Muhlenberg on October 23.

The Mules (8-4) started slowly and had taken only three shots with less than seven minutes remaining in the first half. They finally broke through when sophomore Christine Germaske dribbled along the endline and passed through traffic to Gill, who put it away from close range with 6:35 on the clock.

Gill, who didn’t play much on a deeper squad last year, was one of only seven reserve field players who suited up against the Greyhounds (4-7). She has worked her way up to becoming one of the first players off the bench, a role that suits her well.

“I like being able to come in with fresh legs,” she said. “If people are tired and you go hard, they’re going to want to match your speed, so it lifts everyone up. Also, from the bench we can see a lot of what’s going on and make corrections when we come in.”

Of her goal, Gill said, “I had a lot of opportunities on the post, and I just wanted to get one in there. I knew once we got the first, everyone would get energized and want more.”




The three points for Germaske were a career high.




They got more. Gill’s goal kicked off a run of three goals in five-and-a-half minutes, the Mules’ fastest surge since ... last Wednesday, when they scored three in 5:05 against Bryn Mawr.

With 4:20 left, sophomore Kayleigh Thies blasted the ball in from the wing on a penalty corner. And with 1:05 remaining, Muhlenberg scored off another corner, with Germaske redirecting Thies’ hit from the top of the circle to make it 3-0.

The Mules picked up right where they left off to start the second half. Sophomore Samantha Swire took a shot that was saved, but junior Dayna Hovern put in the rebound with just 3:32 elapsed.

Thies capped the scoring late in the half with her second goal of the game and the 15th of her career. It was the fourth career multiple-goal game for Thies.

Aside from helping the school in the Matte Award race and avenging a 2010 home loss to Moravian in penalty strokes, the win put Muhlenberg in the right frame of mind following Saturday’s disappointing loss to Washington.

“This was a transition game because we’re heading into a tough part of our schedule,” said Gill, referring to a stretch that begins with a game at nationally ranked Franklin & Marshall on Saturday. “This win is going to be a nice push for us and get us going into the last half of the season and conference play.”

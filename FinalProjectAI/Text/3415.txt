One More Qualifier for Track; Men’s Lax Edged

Track and Field



Muhlenberg landed its second NCAA provisional qualifier in as many days at the ECAC Championships when junior Jennifer Lynch
finished third in the mile with a school-record time of 5:02.89. It was the third school record broken by Lynch in her first year in the program.

Three members of
Muhlenberg’s NCAA-qualifying distance medley relay team placed individually: senior David Chorney fourth in the mile, sophomore Bobby Torphy seventh
in the 800 and senior Stuart Udis eighth in the 800.

Despite outshooting FDU-Florham by nine, the Mules came up one goal short in their quest for their first win, falling 8-7.

Muhlenberg trailed 5-1 midway through the second quarter but came back to tie the game on a man-up goal by sophomore Brent Siebold with 6:30 left in the third.
The Devils scored the next two goals to reclaim the lead, and senior Andrew Lolley netted a goal with 42 second left to cut the margin to one. The Mules
won the ensuing faceoff but turned the ball over before they could take a shot to tie. 

Freshman Corey Aferiat led Muhlenberg with two goals and two assists.

Kein dropped both of his bouts by decision on the second day of competition to end the year with a record of 23-6. His final career record was 89-25.

Kein is the fourth Mule – all since 2001 - to earn All-America honors by placing in the top eight at the national meet. Muhlenberg has returned from the NCAA Championships with an All-American six times in the last nine years.

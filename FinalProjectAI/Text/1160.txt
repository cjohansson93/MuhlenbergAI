BackgroundB.A., M.A. University of Notre DamePh.D., University of Wisconsin-Madison
 
Eileen McEwan is Associate Professor of French. She specializes in Francophone cultures of North America and Second Language Acquisition. Her other area of expertise is in African and Caribbean cultures, focusing primarily on writers from Senegal and Haiti who have migrated to France and Canada. Her most recent work explores the migrations of French Canadians to New England in the early twentieth century and the role that the French language played in both the downfall and the recent revival of Franco-American culture.
Her courses focus on contemporary French culture and identity, Quebecois and Franco-American literature, Francophone women writers of Africa and the Caribbean, and French and Francophone cinema. She has also developed a course that allows students to explore the professional uses of French, helping them to combine their interest in French with other disciplines including dance, theater, science, business, international relations, and education.
She has published articles on the connections between women's writing in seventeenth century France and contemporary Francophone cultures, cultural acquisition strategies for teaching Francophone literature, the National Standards for Foreign Language Learning, and Francophone African literature. She is currently working on a book manuscript that critically examines the place of migrant literature in Quebec and Franco-American literature within the littÃ©rature-monde debate..

track teams finish fifth






Seniors Adam Carter and Emily Karel both performed well in their last CC meet. Carter (left) placed sixth in the 110 hurdles and eighth in the 400 hurdles; Karel was seventh in   the 400 meters and placed with both the 4x100 (fourth) and 4x400 (fifth) relay teams.



Both Muhlenberg track and field teams completed a successful weekend at the Centennial Conference Championships by finishing fifth. The women matched their standing at the indoor CC meet, while the men improved their place by one.

The Mules won no gold medals on the third and final day of competition but took home four 
silvers. Senior Erika Koop came the closest to a first-place finish, tying for the best high jump but taking second on number of jumps.

Other second-place performances were turned in by freshman Bobby Torphy in the 800 meters, junior David Chorney in the 1500 and sophomore Brendan Kirk in the 400 hurdles.

Junior Lucy Brock and sophomore Caitlin Heffern earned bronze medals for the women’s team, the former in the 100 hurdles and the 
latter in the javelin.



The future of the program was represented by seven freshmen who scored points. Hayley Kreiger (left), who wasn’t in the top 10 on the CC performance list for the javelin, finished fourth to go along with her seventh-place pole vault. Torphy (right, with sophomore Patrick Thornton) placed in two relays in addition to his 800 silver.

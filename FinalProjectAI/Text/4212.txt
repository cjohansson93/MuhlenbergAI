underclassmen lead the way on home track





Carnevale ranks sixth on the 100-meter hurdle performance list.



Whether she's jumping over a hurdle or into a pit, Stephanie Carnevale can leap far and fast. 

The Muhlenberg freshman showed her prowess both on the track and in the field as she placed four times to highlight a solid day for the Mule track and field team at the Muhlenberg Invitational.

Entering the finals seeded second, Carnevale exploded out of the blocks and led wire-to-wire in winning the 100-meter hurdles.

She also placed third and sixth in the long and triple jump, respectively, and helped the 4x100-meter relay team to a sixth-place finish.

Joining Carnevale in the winners' circle was sophomore Tara Keegan. She took the lead on her very first throw and never let it up as she won the javelin 




Keegan improved upon her personal best by more than six feet in the javelin.



Sustained high winds kept most of the times on the track down, but junior sprinter Peter Rice showed once again that he is one of the fastest men in the Centennial Conference as he shaved 0.19 seconds off of his school record in the 400.

Kimberlee Yalango made a strong push down the stretch to place second in the 200, while William Lowrey did the same in the 1,500.

Sophomore Samantha Mayden landed in fourth place on the program's all-time performance list in the 1,500, placing third in 4:45.74.

Junior Ashley Greenberg also added her name to the 5,000-meter performance list, and sophomore Colette Faust climbed to sixth in Mule history in the high jump.

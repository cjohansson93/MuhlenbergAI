Freshmen Key Players in Women’s Soccer Victory





Miller has three goals and one assist in the first three games of her Muhlenberg career.



The women’s soccer team scored four goals for the third straight game Friday night outshooting Elmira 27-1.

And just like the other two games, Muhlenberg’s freshmen played a huge part in the win.

“The freshmen have had a huge impact,” said junior Kimberly Hacker. “They’re really stepping up to the plate. We all mesh really well and you can’t tell the difference between the younger and older players.”

Freshman Nicolette Miller scored early, just over five minutes into the game, off a cross by junior Jayne Condon. The score would remain 1-0 until late in the first half, but the Mules dominated the field and kept up their intensity, always talking to each other.

“Communication is so important,” said Hacker. “It brings everyone together and no one loses what’s going on on the field.”

The Mules’ communication allowed junior Christina O’Grady to roll a cross by Hacker into the net just before the end of the first half.

Freshman Renee Dessimone also found the back of the net in the second half, notching her fifth goal in three games. She was assisted by Condon.

Miller knocked the final goal into the left corner, off a pass by Kasey Hacker. The goal marked Miller’s third in three games.

The Mules are off to a 3-0 start. “These first three really set the tone for the rest of the season,” said Condon. “We’re really sure of ourselves with the right attitude. We know we have more fun when we’re playing our game.”

The Mules take on Scranton tomorrow at four.

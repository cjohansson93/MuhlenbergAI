women’s lacrosse toughs out CC win


To give you an idea how tough the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse defense played against Haverford, sophomore Lauren DeCarle had to change her jersey because she got blood all over it. 

Muhlenberg came out on top 11-7 for its first Centennial 



Rosen’s go-ahead goal was her 12th of the season.



Conference win, the Mule defense holding the previously undefeated Fords to their lowest scoring game this season. 

With the score tied 2-2 and 40 seconds left in the first half, senior Sara Hiller caused a turnover that was scooped up by junior Katie Ferris and eventually found the back of the net, courtesy of sophomore Danielle Rosen. The go-ahead goal with 25.3 seconds left sent the Mules into the half on top, and they never looked back. 

Haverford pulled with in one with 21:58 left to play, but the Muhlenberg (4-1, 1-1) scored the next three goals to open up a four-goal lead and added eight goals in the second half. 

“Our offense was more patient in the second half,” said Ferris. “They were working for THE shot, not just any shot. They worked better as a team.” 

The Fords, who had outscored their opponents 90-33 in six games, were held in check by a tough Mule defense. 

“We really hustled today,” said Ferris, who scooped up six ground balls, won three draw controls and caused four turnovers. “We won a lot of 50/50 balls and we didn’t get lulled when they tried to settle their attack. We also had good communication; we knew when to slide and when to double.” 

Junior Ashley Foltiny scooped up five ground balls, and DeCarle, whether wearing No. 5 or No. 17, had three draw controls. Senior Marguerite Farrell caused two turnovers, her final occurring with less than 30 seconds left in the game; with the ball back in the Mules’ control, they found the back of the net with under a second to play.
 
“Muhlenberg lacrosse plays hard for 60 minutes every game,” Ferris said. 

Senior Ruth Morrongiello led the Mules with four goals. Hiller led the team with two assists and added a goal; she has found the back of the net in 38 consecutive games.

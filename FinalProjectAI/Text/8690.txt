At Muhlenberg, Studio Art and Art History are housed together in the Art Department, located in the Baker Center for the Arts. We believe that each discipline informs the other, providing students with a more complete understanding of their area of interest. We offer both a major and minor in studio art. Our major is distinctive in offering students areas of concentration in a medium of their choice and in the opportunity for students to participate in a Senior Thesis Exhibition as an extension of the senior capstone.
As part of the liberal arts, our 100 level courses welcome all students at Muhlenberg, regardless of prior experience or intention to major. Studio Art counts for the AR distribution requirement. We offer studio courses in drawing, painting, printmaking, digital and darkroom photography, digital media, and sculpture. In addition, faculty teach interdisciplinary and special topics courses including first year seminars and short-term study abroad. Students at all levels receive one-on-one attention in small classes capped at 15 and have daily access to all of the studio facilities.

 The Studio Art Major & Minor
The curriculum of the studio art program is designed to prepare students to develop independent creative work, research new concepts, gain in-depth skills in a particular medium, and develop transferable skills including written and visual communication. Our students are strongly encouraged to double major/minor, study abroad, and take interdisciplinary courses outside of the department. Students may now also double major/minor in Art History & Studio Art.
Foundations: Students take two foundations courses, Drawing Studio and Digital Foundations. Drawing Studio is an accelerated introductory drawing course (equivalent of Drawing I) for majors and accelerated students. This should be taken instead of Drawing I for students planning to major in Studio Art. Digital Foundations is a seminar exploring digital media and professional practice in contemporary art.
The Concentration: For the core of the major students choose an area of concentration which they explore in depth. Concentrations include: Drawing, Painting, Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture. 
Senior Seminar (CUE): All Studio Art Majors participate in Senior Seminar, an exciting program that allows students to work independently within a supervised structure, meeting regularly with studio art faculty and visiting artists. All studio majors are required to complete the fall semester CUE: Senior Studio Seminar: Portfolio Development, in which they develop a sustained project over the course of the semester. Students who have a strong record of work are invited to extend their project into a yearlong visual thesis, culminating in a group exhibition in the Martin Art Gallery through Senior Studio Seminar: Exhibition.

 Studio Art Honors Program
Selected Studio seniors are invited to enroll in Senior Studio Seminar: Thesis Exhibition during the spring semester. Students enrolled in this course are invited to submit an application to the faculty for honors designation. Departmental Honors in Studio Art will be granted to majors who have met the following conditions:
-The candidate has earned a minimum graduation GPA of 3.20
-The candidate has met the expectations of both Senior Studio Seminar courses.
-The candidate has successfully participated in the Senior Art Exhibit, and the faculty has juried the exhibited work to be of superior quality. The faculty will jury the work based on concept, research and preparation, technical execution, and presentation.

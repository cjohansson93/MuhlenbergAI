Two Early Goals Enough for Men's Soccer to Beat TCNJ
 Wednesday, October 9, 2013 - page 2







					 



Joe Adams is usually on the front end of long throws that result in scoring opportunities for his teammates on the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team. And he was early in the Mules’ non-conference home game against The College of New Jersey. 




McIntyre's goal - at 5:38 the earliest by the Mules this season - was the second of his career.



A little while later, though, he found that it can be just as good to receive as it is to give.

Adams assisted on the first goal and scored the second as Muhlenberg defeated the regionally ranked Lions, 2-1.



The win give the Mules (7-5) a record of 3-1 in their current stretch of the four ranked opponents in five games; they wrap it up at defending Centennial Conference champion Haverford (seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region) on Saturday. TCNJ (7-4-2) is eighth in the South Atlantic and just a week ago handed No. 2 Rutgers-Camden its first blemish of the season with a 1-1 tie.



Women’s Soccer Blanked at Haverford


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team suffered a 3-0 loss at Haverford, a squad that has advanced to at least the Centennial Conference semifinals 
every year since 2009, winning the championship last year.

The Mules (5-6-1, 3-2) gave up an early own goal when a clearance attempt deflected off the keeper and in. The game remained 1-0 until the
Fords (5-2-4, 2-0-2) scored twice in a span of 3:10 in the second half.

Muhlenberg looked like the ranked team for the majority of the first half, outshooting the Lions by a 7-2 margin. In the sixth minute, Adams’ throw into the box was flicked backwards by junior Lance Dotzman, and senior Brendan McIntyre beat his defender to the ball along the 6 and tapped it in for his first goal of the season.

Eight minutes later, the Mules were awarded a free kick when senior Jeff Reinhart was fouled about 30 yards from the goal. Junior Bryan Attanasio’s looping service went over the head of a jumping Dotzman and right to the foot of Adams, who buried it in the back of the net for his first career goal. 

That was all the scoring for Muhlenberg as the game took on a resemblance to last year’s match against TCNJ, in which the Mules took a 3-0 lead into the half and hung on to win, 3-2. The Lions got one of the goals back when the fourth-leading scorer in Division III converted a penalty kick with just over 20 minutes remaining, but the Muhlenberg defense prevented them from getting a good shot to tie the game.

Junior Danny Pinto, making his first start of the season, made one save and allowed only the PK to earn the win.

The Mules finished the season 5-3 against their eight non-conference opponents, who entered the night with a combined record of 52-29-8 (.629).

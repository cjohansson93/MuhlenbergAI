Alpha Sigma Lambda

In December 2008, Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies received a charter for a prestigious national honor society for adult students.
The society, Alpha Sigma Lambda, was founded in 1945 to honor dedicated adult students who, while handling their life responsibilities, achieve and maintain high scholastic standards.
Membership is offered to students who are of senior status, working on their first degree and are in the top 20 percent of their class.
Alpha Sigma Lambda members are role models for scholastic growth among their peers and within their communities, and the Society as a whole assists with recruitment and retention of nontraditional, adult students.
The School of Continuing Studies' chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda has been named Eta Chi.
For more information, please contact the School of Continuing Studies.

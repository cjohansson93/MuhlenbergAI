On its last day of competition before final exams, the Muhlenberg women's basketball earned straight As.

The Mules received high grades from the voters in the national Division III polls, moving up to No. 16 in the D3hoops.com
poll and No. 17 in the Women's Basketball Coaches
Association poll.

Muhlenberg aced its first game with the new rankings, breezing past Bryn Mawr, 87-43, for 




its seventh straight win to start the season.

The Mules were nearly flawless in the first half, using runs of 10-0, 13-0 and 16-0 to take a 54-9 lead at the break. Even with their starters sitting
for the majority of the second half, the margin ballooned to 56 with 8 minutes left.

Five players scored in double figures for Muhlenberg, led by sophomore Julie Kelly with a career-high 16 points. 
Sophomore Alita Zabrecky had 14 points, 7 rebounds 2 assists and 3 steals in only 10 minutes, and junior Alexandra Chili
also scored 14 in only 12 minutes. Freshman Colleen Caldwell (right) contributed a career-high 13 points, and sophomore Kate Clawson
added 10.

All 13 active Muhlenberg players recorded at least one assist in the game, and all but one scored at least two points — and the player who didn't,
freshman Ellen Rich, pulled down a team-high 8 rebounds.

Muhlenberg committed only 7 turnovers and set a school record with 11 blocked shots. Pictured at left is freshman Katy Mitton with

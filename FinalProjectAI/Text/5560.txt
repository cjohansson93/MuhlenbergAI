Sophomore Phil Cresta of the Muhlenberg baseball team was named pitcher of the week by the Centennial Conference.

The southpaw started shutout wins against Ursinus and McDaniel, allowing only five hits while striking out seven in 13 innings. Opponents hit just .114 against Cresta in the two starts, and only two runners reached scoring position. He now has scoreless streaks of 20 1/3 innings overall and 28 innings in CC road games.

For the season, Cresta leads the CC with seven wins and is tied for fifth with 38 strikeouts. He is 5-1 with a 2.43 ERA in CC games.

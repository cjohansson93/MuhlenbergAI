Baseball, Women's Tennis and Lacrosse Teams All Suffer Losses
 Saturday, March 24, 2012







					 



The Muhlenberg baseball team danced through raindrops but could not dance past The College of New Jersey, losing two games in its final doubleheader before the start of Centennial Conference play.

The Mules (15-6) led late in the first game and early in the second and got the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth in both, but the 19-time NCAA Tournament participant Lions (10-7) prevailed, 7-3 and 13-10.

In the opener, Muhlenberg broke a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the sixth on an RBI double by sophomore Brett Rosen, but TCNJ scored two unearned runs in the seventh to go up 4-3. The Mules loaded the bases in the eighth and again in the ninth but could not bring home any more runs.

Freshman Matthew Lawsky (right) pitched into the seventh, allowing only six hits and two earned runs.

Muhlenberg scored five runs in the second inning of Game 2 to grab a 6-3 lead, but it didn’t last. TCNJ scored the next 10 runs and took a 13-6 lead into the bottom of the ninth. The Mules had the tying run on the on-deck circle with nobody out and at the plate with two out before the Lions completed the sweep.

Sophomore Nick Kennedy drove in three runs in the nightcap, and junior John Muha was 3-for-5 with a double. Freshman Chris Manfredonia had two hits in each game.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team split a pair of Centennial Conference road matches on Friday and Saturday. The Mules won four singles matches to beat Bryn Mawr, 6-3, on Friday, but dropped a pair of third set super-tiebreakers in a 6-3 loss at Gettysburg on Saturday.

Sophomore Emily Szulman and freshman Jennifer Goldberg won both their singles and doubles matches against Bryn Mawr and were the only two Mules to pick up singles victories against the Bullets. Goldberg (left) only dropped three games in each of her two matches at No. 3 singles, and Szulman shut out her Gettysburg opponent in the second set to clinch her match at No. 2 singles.

Junior Amanda von Taube and freshman Sharen Resnikoff won their singles matches against the Owls and teamed up to post Muhlenberg’s lone doubles win against Gettysburg.

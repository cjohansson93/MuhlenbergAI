LoPipero Named Player of the Week




Junior Jason LoPipero of the Muhlenberg football team was named special teams player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

LoPipero kept the Moravian offense in the shadow of its own goal posts the whole afternoon in the Mules’ 7-0 shutout win yesterday, dropping seven of his nine punts inside the 20. With Muhlenberg leading by just a touchdown, LoPipero downed his four second-half punts at the 17, 16, 5 and 15.

Although LoPipero finished the season fifth in the CC in punting with an average of 34.7 yards per boot, the Mules led the CC with a net punting average of 33.1. LoPipero led the CC with 21 punts inside the 20.






Junior Bobby Torphy of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team is headed to Cleveland.

Torphy received a bid to the NCAA Division III Championships, to be held at Highland Hills Golf Course in Highland Hills, Ohio, on Saturday, November 21. Baldwin-Wallace is the host school.

Torphy finished 22nd at the NCAA Mideast Regional hosted by Muhlenberg yesterday and needed the NCAA to award at-large bids to two teams in the region to make the national championship field. As it turned out, the Mideast received the maximum three at-large bids, and Torphy was the fifth-place runner from a non-qualifying team.

This is the fifth straight year at least one Muhlenberg runner has qualified for the NCAA meet in cross country. Torphy, who was an All-American in indoor track as a sophomore, is the first Mule to qualify for the NCAA Championships in track and cross country in the same calendar year.

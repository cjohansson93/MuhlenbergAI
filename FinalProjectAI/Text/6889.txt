Litvak Ties Hits Record as Baseball Coasts to Win
 Wednesday, April 3, 2013 - page 2







					 





Litvak was making his first start of the season and came into the game with a total of one hit in six at-bats.




Lake Keuka in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York used to be known as Crooked Lake because of its unusual shape. And in its game against the college located on the shores of Lake Keuka, the Muhlenberg baseball team put up plenty of crooked numbers.

The Mules scored at least three runs in each of the first four innings, including eight in the fourth, en route to defeating Keuka, 22-11. The win was the fourth in five games for the Mules (14-8), and in all four they have reached double figures in runs.



Women’s Lacrosse Falls at Haverford


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team fell to 0-3 in the Centennial Conference with a 19-11 loss at Haverford.

The Fords (8-2, 2-1) scored the first five goals of the game, and the Mules (5-4) never got closer than four.

Sophomore Stephanie Umbach scored four goals for her seventh hat trick of the season. Junior Michelle Certosimo recorded six assists.

The 22 runs were the most scored by Muhlenberg since a 29-0 shutout of Baptist Bible in the 2011 finale. The Mules have reached the 20-run mark in at least one game in each of the last four years.

Junior Max Litvak led the offense by going 6-for-6 with six RBI, tying the school and Centennial Conference record for hits in a game, which was also tied by senior John Muha five days ago against Penn State Brandywine. Litvak had a two-out RBI single in the first, an RBI triple in the second and a two-run double in the third before adding singles in his final three at-bats.

Junior Brett Rosen drove in four runs for the second straight day, sophomore Danny Usewick went 3-for-4 with three RBI, junior Nick Kennedy had three hits, including a double, and sophomore Kurt Johnson scored four runs.

Freshman Jordan Leopold, making his first career start, drove in two runs and scored two.

Muha pulled off a combination of two rare feats to make an even more unusual accomplishment. The leadoff hitter, who was 17-for-20 in his previous four home games, made two outs in the first inning, when the Mules batted around and scored five runs. In the fourth, Muha led off with a single and capped the eight-run rally with a two-run single. That gave him the unique distinction of making two outs in one inning and getting two hits in another inning of the same game.

Junior Pat Doolittle worked two scoreless innings in relief to earn his first win of the season.

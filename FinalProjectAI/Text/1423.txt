To Members of the Muhlenberg Family,
I want to thank the many members of our community who suggested improvements to the draft of the College's diversity statement, posted for review in January. I received many excellent suggestions, and have incorporated most of them into the current draft, which can be found at the attached link.
I hesitate to call this statement a "final draft" because our diversity philosophy, like our efforts to increase, nurture, and celebrate diversity on our campus, will always be a work in progress. However, I think this statement is a good beginning, and I am grateful to the faculty and staff who assisted me in preparing the early drafts, and to all of you who participated in their refinement.
It was not possible, of course, to accommodate all suggestions. Some respondents found the statement too long and detailed; others thought it too short and not sufficiently specific.
It is important for us all to remember that this text, whatever its strengths and shortcomings, is nothing more or less than a declaration of our shared values. Of even greater importance will be the deeds that accompany our words. I am pleased that the campus has embraced diversity in so many ways during the past year, ranging from a new partnership with Art Sanctuary in North Philadelphia, to the Center for Ethics series on Identity, to the Admissions Multicultural Ambassadors Program, to the work of the Multicultural Center Task Force, to faculty, staff, and student recruiting efforts, to numerous programs, speakers, performances, classroom debates, and discussions both formal and informal.
I look forward to our continued work together as we strive to bring Muhlenberg into ever closer alignment with our shared ideals.
Cordially, Randy Helm

Saludos! We are Comunidad. 
Our affinity group is focused on creating a community between Latine/x students on campus and our allies. We strive for an inclusive environment while also supporting a safe space for students who identify as Latine/x, Hispanic and Caribbean. 
Our goal is to remind Muhlenberg that we are here, we are present, we are valid. 
We hope you choose to join us for our bi-weekly meetings (Monday at 7 p.m.) to learn more about who we are, our mission and our people! Our instagram is @muhlenbergcomunidad and our contact is jhernandez@muhlenberg.edu. Nos vemos!

Arriving on campus as a new resident can be a whirlwind of an experience, and for many, itâs the first time living away from home. But your Resident Advisor, one of the first people you meet on move-in day, can make all the difference.
Our RAs are the backbone of our residential community on campus, helping their peers in ways both big and small. Learn more about a typical day in the life of an RA at Muhlenberg.
We know our students learn best from their peers and our RAs impact their community by leading with a true sense of inclusivity and care for each of their residents. Through Muhlenbergâs Residential Curriculum, RAs are able to create individual relationships with their residents. These efforts are made possible through intentional conversation, community events and passive engagementâall skills that RAs are equipped with through training.
As student mentors, Muhlenberg RAs acquire leadership and problem-solving skills while experiencing the joy of building their student community. Explore the RA application process and learn how you can make a difference on campus.

Transitioning into college as a first-generation student 800 miles away from home was tough my freshman year. My RA made Muhlenberg feel like a home.

During my first year, my RA helped make a difficult transition for me so much more comfortable. I really wanted to be that for someone else.

I love the student-to-student realness that is shared. We have a unique opportunity to connect with residents in a way that allows us to support them.

What I love most about being an RA is building community with all of my residents. Before I’m an RA to my residents, I’m a friend.

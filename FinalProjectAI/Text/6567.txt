Football Shuts Out F&M to Give Donnelly 100th Win
 Saturday, September 8, 2012

The uniforms had a more modern look to them, and the spread formations and hurry-up attack gave the offense more of a 21st-century feel, but what got Mike Donnelly his 100th career win as Muhlenberg football coach was the same thing responsible for many of the first 99: good old-fashioned defense.




O’Connor celebrates his fumble recovery. He has been responsible for a takeaway in each of the first two games.



The Mules  allowed only 231 yards in beating Franklin & Marshall, 21-0, in their home and Centennial Conference opener. It was the 19th shutout win for Donnelly, who has a career record of 100-61 in his 16th season.

“I’m very proud to be on the team that got his 100th win,” said senior guard Garrett Bisbing. “He’s coached many great players and it’s awesome to be a part of that.”

Muhlenberg (2-0, 1-0) forced a fumble on the second play of the game, with sophomore Greg DeLade stripping the ball and senior Shane O’Connor recovering. Although the play didn’t lead directly to any points, it set the defensive tone for the game.




After being held to 30 yards on 11 carries in the first half, Dandridge gained 69 yards on 13 rushes in the second, including a 23-yard burst on third-and-2 on the
Mules’ final touchdown drive.



The Diplomats (1-1, 0-1), who scored 35 points behind the CC offensive player of the week in their opener, had only one serious scoring opportunity, missing a 33-yard field goal late in the second quarter. They did not have an offensive play of longer than 14 yards. The Mule defense allowed only 94 yards in the second half and forced three turnovers.

Junior Kory Crichton led the defense with 12 tackles, including a sack, and fellow inside linebacker Matt Johnson recorded eight stops and an interception.

Offensively, senior quarterback Dan Deighan threw for 107 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 91 and another score. Senior Terrence Dandridge rushed for 99 yards and the third Muhlenberg TD.


The Mules started their second drive at the 20 following a punt into the end zone and needed only four plays to make it to the other end zone. Deighan found senior Isaiah Vaughn in stride on a post pattern for a 43-yard scoring play.


On Muhlenberg’s next offensive play, Vaughn had an electrifying 57-yard touchdown run on a double reverse, but the play was called back by a holding penalty.

The score remained 7-0 at the end of the first half. On the third play of the second half, Deighan juggled the snap, then ran around right end 47 yards for a touchdown.


The Mules sealed the win with a nine-play, 73-yard drive, culminating in Dandridge’s 8-yard scoring run, late in the fourth quarter.


Muhlenberg’s defense put the stamp on the win on F&M’s final drive, sacking quarterback Anthony Carlucci on three straight plays. And that helped seal a happy day for his older brother, Mule junior quarterback Joe Carlucci, who rushed for 37 yards and passed for 13.


“We played physical and we never quit,” said the older Carlucci. “The offense was erratic in the first half, but at halftime we composed ourselves. I’m proud of the fact that we stayed together as a team.”

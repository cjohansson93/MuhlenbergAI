Wrestling Opens Season at King's
 Saturday, November 3, 2012 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg wrestling team opened its 2012-13 season at the Monarch Invitational, hosted by King’s.

Of the four Mules who competed, the only one to come up with a win was senior Matt Parker, who posted a 12-5 decision over an opponent from 
Roger Williams in the first round at 149. Parker (right) was pinned by the No. 2 seed and eventual champion in his next bout and forfeited out of the consolation bracket for
medical reasons.

Freshmen Che Chengsupanimit and Matthew Goldstein both dropped a pair of close decisions at 141.

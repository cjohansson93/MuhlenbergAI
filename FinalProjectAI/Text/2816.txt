MEN’S BASKETBALL FALLS AT URSINUS,WILL RETURN WEDNESDAY 


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team will have to hope the third time’s a charm.




In his final regular-season game, Frankoski picked up his first career double-double.



Ursinus completed the regular-season sweep of the Mules in overtime, 89-83, setting up a rematch between the two teams on Wednesday in Collegeville in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs. Washington beat Johns Hopkins at the buzzer, 72-69, giving the Shoremen the third seed and a bye in the first round and putting home court in the first round on the line in the Mules-Bears matchup.

The Mules (12-13, 10-8) looked on their way to locking up home court after turning a six-point deficit into a five-point lead late in the second half. Muhlenberg trailed 52-46 when senior Obi Nwizugbo hit a pair of jumpers and sophomore Spencer Liddic made two layups and two free throws to tie it up.

Junior Evan Tozer then gave the Mules their first lead of the half with a pair of free throws and followed it by draining a three from the left corner. Ursinus (15-10, 11-7) tied it at 61-all, and both squads traded baskets to make it 65-apiece.

With Muhlenberg trailing 67-65, Liddic hit two clutch free throws with 57.4 seconds left to tie the score. Ursinus again went up two, but senior Brian Frankoski tied the score by driving down the left baseline and finishing a layup with 17.8 to play. The Bears missed a chance to win it at the buzzer, sending the game to overtime.

Poor free-throw shooting hurt the Mules early in the extra session, but they fought back from a big deficit to make it close. The Bears led 81-72 when Frankoski hit a pair of free throws and, after an Ursinus turnover on the inbounds, Tozer nailed a three from the top of the key.

A putback by Frankoski with 47.9 seconds left made it 83-79, but the Bears went 6-for-6 from the line the rest of the way to seal the win.

Liddic recorded his CC-leading 12th double-double of the season with 20 points, 18 of which came in the second half and overtime, and 11 rebounds. Frankoski 
(18 points, 10 rebounds, four assists) also posted a double-double, and Tozer finished with a career-high 20 points.

three earn all-cc v-ball honors



Three members of the Muhlenberg volleyball team were chosen for the All-Centennial Conference team by the league’s coaches.

Junior Phylicia Lee was a second-team pick, and senior Megan Eiser and freshman Davi Gordon earned honorable mention.

Lee (right) led the Mules and ranked ninth in the CC in kills per set (2.91). She also was ninth in the CC in service aces, averaging 0.40 a set. Lee topped Muhlenberg
with a .215 hitting percentage and was fourth in digs per set (2.60). Her 18 kills, achieved in three separate matches, were the most by a Mule this season. She will
enter her senior year 12th on the program’s all-time list with 489 career kills.

Eiser was seventh in the CC in assists per set (7.98) and graduated with the third-most assists in team history (2,229). She was named to two all-tournament teams during
the season and ranked fourth on the team in blocks and fifth in digs.

Gordon, the fourth Mule freshman to make the All-CC team, was third in the conference in blocks at 0.78 per set. She averaged 1.54 kills per set.

The three All-CC picks tied for the most in program history. The Mules last had three All-CC players in 2002.

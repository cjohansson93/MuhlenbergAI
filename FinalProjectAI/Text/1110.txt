Important Health and Safety Updates for the Spring Semester:
COVID-19 Booster Shots
This past semester we have been fortunate to experience very low levels of COVID-19 transmission on campus due in large part to the high rate of vaccination among our students, faculty and staff. As the more transmissible Omicron variant combines with the waning effectiveness of COVID vaccines over time, we are seeing a rise in breakthrough cases across the country. The current conditions have led Muhlenberg to update our vaccination policy for the spring semester to include boosters. Muhlenberg students will be required to have received a COVID-19 booster vaccine as of Tuesday, February 1, 2022 or within 30 days of becoming eligible. We strongly recommend that if you are eligible during the winter break that you get your booster shot before returning to campus.
You are eligible for a booster:

At least five months after receiving your second primary COVID-19 vaccination of Moderna or Pfizer; or
At least two months after completing your single primary COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnsonâs Janssen.

(Those who received another WHO-approved vaccine should consult the CDC guidance on when to get a booster if you were vaccinated outside of the United States.) Faculty and staff will also be required to obtain the booster shot by February 1 or within 30 days of becoming eligible. This policy update aligns with the CDCâs most recent guidance recommending that âeveryone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot.â In addition, moving forward many health experts believe that the likely definition of "fully-vaccinated" will change to include a third shot. Students must complete the COVID-19 Booster Vaccine Form in the âMy Formsâ tab of their student health portal. You will be required to upload documentation of your COVID-19 booster vaccine within the form. This form will be available in your health portal after January 3, 2022.
Previously approved COVID-19 vaccination exemptions for students will apply to the booster requirement as well. Approved exemptions do not need to be renewed. We expect to offer a number of on-campus vaccine clinics after the winter break and will share details once they become available. However, if you are currently eligible, you should try to get your booster shot while you are home for winter break. Please see below for a list of local and national providers offering booster vaccines as well as resources to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines. We will also continue to monitor local and national conditions and to prioritize the health and well-being of our campus community. Based on current data, we are confident that booster shots will provide the most effective means to reduce spread of the virus, protect vulnerable members of our community, and ensure we continue to benefit from the in-person learning and community engagement that are the hallmark of the Muhlenberg experience.

Flu Vaccine Requirement
The College continues to require an annual flu vaccination. Both COVID-19 and the flu will be spreading this winter. They present with similar symptoms and students can be infected with both at the same time. Vaccination is our best protection! Students must complete the Annual Flu Vaccine Form in the âMy Formsâ tab of their student health portal. You will be required to upload documentation of the flu vaccine within the form by January 3, 2022. If you have previously submitted your flu vaccine documentation, you do not need to do anything more.
Spring Semester Pre-Arrival Testing
In comparing Muhlenbergâs data to that of other campuses, we are confident that the required pre-arrival testing for the fall semester helped us start the semester safely. This will be even more critical as we return from winter break and while the highly contagious Omicron variant is prevalent. As such, students are required to take a COVID-19 PCR or rapid antigen test within 3 days before returning to campus. Your negative result will need to be uploaded to your health portal prior to moving in or regaining access to your meal plan and/or Muhlenberg facilities.
Residential Students: Test date must be within 3 days prior to move-in.
Off-Campus Students: Test date must be within 3 days prior to the first day you access campus for spring semester. For the safety of your housemates, you are encouraged (but not required) to also test before you move-in to your off campus house, if this date is different from the date you will first access campus.
Commuter Students: Test date must be within 3 days of the first day you access campus for the spring semester.
Students who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 90 days before returning to campus: You must upload a copy of your COVID-19 positive test in the health portal to be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement.If you have had an active case of COVID now, you must first notify Health Services. You must complete your isolation period of 5 days and then test negative on an ANTIGEN test to return to campus. This test result must be uploaded in the health portal and you must contact health services for return instructions.

General Information about COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements
Why is Muhlenberg requiring the COVID-19 booster for all students?This past semester we have been fortunate to experience very low levels of COVID-19 transmission on campus due in large part to the high rate of vaccination among our students, faculty and staff. As the more transmissible Omicron variant combines with the waning effectiveness of COVID vaccines over time, we are seeing a rise in breakthrough cases across the country. The current conditions have led Muhlenberg to update our vaccination policy for the spring semester to include boosters so we can continue to have in-person instruction and the vibrant, interactive, residential community that creates the full Muhlenberg experience.
When does the COVID-19 booster requirement for students go into effect?Muhlenberg students are required to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine by Tuesday, February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible. We strongly recommend that if you are eligible during the winter break that you get your booster shot before returning to campus.
You are eligible for a booster if you are:

At least five months after receiving your second primary COVID-19 vaccination of Moderna or Pfizer; or
At least two months after completing your single primary COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnsonâs Janssen.

I recently had COVID-19. When can I get my booster vaccine?According to the CDC, individuals can receive the COVID vaccine after they have recovered and met the criteria for discontinuing isolation (except those who were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasmaâthey should wait 90 days). Please consult with your health care provider for their recommendations about the date you should receive the booster vaccine.  If it is after the College deadline of February 1, 2022, please contact Health Services.
How do I submit my vaccine documentation?Scan or take a picture of the front of your completed COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card. Be sure we can read your name, date of birth and the completed vaccine record. All students should upload their COVID-19 vaccination documentation to their health portal if they have not already done so. The deadline for submission of COVID-19 booster vaccine documentation for all students is February 1, 2022, or within 30 days of becoming eligible.
What should I do if I have lost my immunization card?Contact the medical office or pharmacy where you received your vaccination and request documentation that you received the vaccine. The documentation must include manufacturer, lot number, date of administration and location.
Questions About Exemptions
Can I request an exemption from the booster vaccine requirement?If you have already been granted an exemption by our Health Center for the COVID-19 vaccine, then you do not need a new exemption related to the booster shot.
If you do not already have an exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine, you are not eligible for an exemption from the booster shot unless it is an extraordinary and new medical issue. New religious exemptions will not be considered. 
What authority does Muhlenberg have to impose this vaccination requirement?Muhlenberg already requires vaccines to mitigate risks for other highly contagious diseases, and the COVID-19 immunization requirement is consistent with the exercise of Muhlenberg's authority as a private institution to protect the health and safety of the campus community. By requiring the COVID-19 vaccine, Muhlenberg is able to move toward offering the traditional campus experience to our students in a healthy and safe environment. Students who choose not to be vaccinated and are not otherwise eligible for an exemption may request a leave of absence until the community risk of COVID-19 is mitigated.
If I am approved for an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine, what health and safety protocols will I have to follow?Students who are exempt from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for medical or religious/ethical reasons will be required to:

Have a COVID-19 pre-arrival test taken within 3 days prior to arrival on campus and upload negative test results to their student health portal before campus arrival.
Participate in weekly COVID-19 surveillance testing implemented by the College.
Wear a face mask while indoors provided that face masks are not required when an individual who is not fully vaccinated is in their assigned living space by themselves or with only designated roommate(s), suitemate(s), or apartment-mate(s), while bathing or swimming, and when working in a private, single-occupancy room with the door closed (i.e. music room, etc.).
Quarantine if identified as a close contact with a COVID-19 positive case. 

COVID-19 Vaccination General Information
Where can students receive the booster vaccine?
We expect to offer a number of on-campus vaccine clinics after the winter break and will share details once they become available. Below is a list of local and national providers offering booster vaccines.

Call 1-866-STLUKES (866-785-8537)

What kind of mask should I wear?The best mask for you is the one you will wear correctly. To meet college requirements, it must be multi-layered with ear straps that allow the mask to fit snugly against the face. It must also fully cover your nose and mouth at all times.  
Our local health care providers are recommending surgical masks, KN95 masks and N95 masks as the most effective. KN95 masks typically fit more comfortably while providing full coverage of the nose and mouth more easily. The College will provide two KN95 masks for all students and employees at the start of the semester.

Isolation and Quarantine Information
Please see below for a quick guide to quarantine and isolation for the Spring 2022 semester. 
For a comprehensive policy review, please view our Guide to Quarantine & Isolation at Muhlenberg Spring 2022 document (PDF).
When do I need to isolate or quarantine?
IsolationIf a student tests positive, they must upload a negative antigen test on or after day 6 in order to return from isolation. Antigen tests accurately measure a viral load to ensure someone who recently had COVID-19 is no longer infectious when a negative result is displayed. This is not the case for PCR-based tests.Students will be able to pick up one over-the-counter antigen test for free from the health center AFTER they test positive (or after they upload a OTC positive test). If a student needs to test more than once in order to return, subsequent tests will be the responsibility of the individual student.Students who are in isolation can test as early as day 6 if their symptoms are gone or are significantly dissipating and they have been fever-free for 24+ hours (without fever-reducing medication). This can be done on any OTC test or the test provided by the Health Center. Once students have a negative result, they may upload it to the Health Portal and will be cleared to return to campus.
Exposure and QuarantineStudents who are exposed to someone with COVID-19 must follow the guidelines outlined below: 
If you meet the following criteria:

Have been boosted, or 
Have completed the primary series of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine within the last 5 months, or 
Have completed the J&J vaccines within the last 2 months

THEN, you must wear a mask around others for 10 days, use âto-goâ dining, test on day five and upload your test to the health portal. If your test is positive, follow the isolation guidelines.  
If you meet the following criteria:

Are unvaccinated, or 
Have completed the primary series of Moderna or Pfizer over 5 months ago and are NOT boosted, or
Have completed the primary series of J&J over two months ago and are NOT boosted

THEN, you must quarantine for 5 days and test on day 5. If your test is negative on day 5, you must upload your test to the health center, continue to wear a mask and use âto-goâ dining for an additional 5 days. If your test is positive, follow the isolation guidelines.  
Anyone who develops symptoms should get a test immediately and stay home away from others.
Where will I go for the period of isolation or quarantine?Students who are required to isolate or quarantine during the semester and who live within 300 miles of the College are encouraged, but not required, to return home for this period of time. Students who are vaccinated and symptomatic and remain on campus will be assigned a roommate in isolation housing on campus.For those who cannot go home for a variety of reasons, the College will continue to provide extra support through the Dean's Office, Housing and Residence Life, Dining Services and the Health Center.






          Pre-Arrival Testing FAQ
  








Why is the College requiring pre-arrival COVID-19 tests?
Throughout the pandemic, we have adjusted our COVID-19 safety measures as new information becomes available. Because the number of cases of COVID-19 infection is increasing due to the Delta variant and because students will be traveling to the College from varying levels of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination in their communities, the College will require pre-arrival testing for all students.
 
If I am vaccinated, why do I need a pre-arrival test?COVID-19 vaccination provides the best protection to our community. The vaccines are effective against severe disease and death from COVID-19 and its variants that are currently circulating in the United States, including the Delta variant. We know that infections happen in only a small proportion of people who are fully vaccinated, even with the Delta variant. When these infections occur among vaccinated people, they tend to be mild. Unfortunately, we also are aware that if you are fully vaccinated and become infected with the Delta variant, you can spread the virus to others. 
 
What type of test will the College accept for pre-arrival?The College will accept PCR tests and rapid antigen tests for pre-arrival. Antibody tests will not be accepted.
 
Who needs a pre-arrival test?All students, regardless of vaccination status, are required to have a pre-arrival COVID-19 test. Students who tested COVID-19 positive within the 90 day period prior to arrival are exempt from testing.
 
I had COVID-19 in the past 90 days. Do I need a pre-arrival test?Students who have had a COVID-19 positive lab test in the past 90 days will be exempt from testing. You must upload your positive lab test result to the health portal.
 
Is Muhlenberg providing the test?The College is not providing pre-arrival tests unless a student has an extraordinary circumstance and has coordinated assistance with testing through Health Services. Access to COVID-19 testing is prevalent and result turnaround times are fast. Many students have had COVID-19 testing done on their own for a multitude of reasons and are familiar and comfortable with testing providers in their areas. In order to make the pre-arrival testing as convenient as possible for students, the College is permitting students to have their COVID-19 test done by the provider of their choice. 
 
What if my test results come back as positive?You must stay home and follow-up with your medical provider at home for any needed clinical evaluation and treatment, You may not move in or access campus until you complete your isolation per CDC guidelines. You must upload your test results into the health portal and contact Health Services for approval to access campus or move into campus after isolation.
 
Do parents or my move-in helpers need to be tested to assist me with moving in?Parents and/or move-in helpers are not required to test. All individuals will be required to wear a mask while indoors. [Any person who has COVID-19 like symptoms, any recent known or suspected COVID-19 exposure, or has been told to quarantine (either due to exposure or travel), should not access campus.]
 
How quickly will I be tested again after arriving at Muhlenberg?All students who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated will be tested weekly beginning the week of August 30th. Testing plans may be adjusted as needed depending on COVID-19 conditions.
 
When should I get my pre-arrival test?

Residential Students: within 3 days prior to move-in
Off Campus Students: within 3 days prior to moving into their off campus residence
Commuter Students: within 3 days prior to accessing campus







          Muhlenberg College COVID-19 Masking Policy
  








The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its guidelines for mask-wearing and introduced the COVID-19 Community Levels tool to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs.
Visitors are required to adhere to the same policies in place for campus community members. 
The College expects there are individuals who will continue to wear masks either by choice or out of necessity. We also expect that all community members will be respectful of one anotherâs decisions about wearing a mask. Our COVID policy requires all individuals to adhere to the discretion of faculty, staff or students within their own classroom and office spaces, activities and events.  Failure to do so is a violation of our COVID policy and will be addressed when reported to the Dean of Students Office or Human Resources. 
In support of our immunocompromised community members, the College will provide antigen tests and KN95 masks to these individuals for the remainder of the semester. KN95 masks are recommended by the College for those who wish to protect themselves to the fullest extent.






          COVID-19 Hosting Campus Events Policy
  








Hosting Events on Campus - Spring 2022
For the safety of our campus community and all guests and audience members on the Muhlenberg campus, the following requirements are currently in place.
Event Categories:
Closed Events - Closed Events are events that take place on campus, sponsored by College departments or recognized student organizations, whose intended audience is limited to students, faculty and/or staff. Students should carry their student IDs at all times while on campus, and IDs must be presented when requested by a College official.
Open Events - Open Events are events that take place on campus and are sponsored by College departments, recognized student organizations or external programming managed through Conference & Event Services, whose intended audience includes guests of the College or the general public. These events may include general admission, open to the public, ticketed programs or by invitation only. The following Open Event types should plan to manage audience access using the following processes:

Performance Events - These events will follow the Department of Theatre and Danceâs typical ticketing procedures when necessary. Performers and lecturers should be positioned at least 12 feet from audience members throughout the performance.
Meals with guests- Holding a meal on campus with invited guests is permitted. Event planners may also work with Seegers Union staff to determine what spaces on campus will comfortably meet their needs.


Catering Guidelines
Red Door Catering and Muhlenberg Dining continue to operate with staff shortages as well as supply chain challenges, with our team working long shifts with limited days off.We continue to ask the campus to allow for a minimum of ten business days for catered events to enable us to plan effectively and ensure that we can accommodate all requests at the highest level of service. Unfortunately, failure to provide ample notice may impact menu, service style or even our ability to support a catered program on campus.As we look at the Collegeâs calendar of signature events planned for the remainder of the spring, we would like to make you aware that during the following dates we may need to modify catering services. As a result, we encourage you to consider limited catering support or select alternate dates if possible:

April 6 - April 9: Through the Red Doors Programming
April 28 - April 30: Board of Trustees, Explore Muhlenberg and Scholarship Luncheon

Red Door Catering will make every effort to support special events; however your assistance in navigating these dates will enable us to fully support College signature events with the highest level of service and attention.

 
Event Sponsors Responsibilities

Event sponsors should continue to monitor College policy as their event approaches.  Modifications to processes, access and capacities could change unexpectedly throughout the semester and we will need to plan accordingly. All other College processes, policy and protocols remain in effect when scheduling events on campus.
Event sponsors need to determine if a pre-registration mechanism will be used. 

*Masking and other restrictions are subject to change in accordance with CDC recommendations, state requirements, and College policy.
*Should we see a change in conditions, the College reserves the right to require pre-event testing and/or proof of vaccination.
*We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we continue to work through an active semester while keeping our community safe.

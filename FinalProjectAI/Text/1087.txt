Institutional Impacts of COVID-19 
Wednesday, May 20, 2020

Dear faculty and staff,
As we come to the end of this unprecedented academic year, I want to acknowledge the disruptive effect that this health crisis has had on each one of you and your families. Yet, in the face of the stress you experienced, you continued to provide incredible support to our students and to one another. Thank you.
My promise to each of you is to be open and transparent about the effect of this crisis on the Collegeâs current and future situation. The financial impact of COVID-19 so far has been significant for the College. Consequently, we need to make difficult decisions now to address the current impact and prepare for what the future may hold.
The most significant expenses to date have been refunds to students for room and board, lost revenues from summer programs and direct expenses to support the move to remote learning and work. We realized savings from utilities, cancelled events and faculty and staff travel. The federal CARES Act institutional allocation of $800,000 to the College provided some relief. When the expense, savings and federal funds are considered, we estimate that the crisis has cost Muhlenberg about $3 million so far.
Given current disruptions and uncertainties about the future, the College has to implement measures to preserve our current and long-term financial health. These measures were approved by senior staff and the Board of Trustees after considerable discussion among the senior leadership and extensive review of the current financial data and projections for the next fiscal year.
Salary Increases 20-21: The decision about salary increases typically is tied to first-year enrollment and discount rate with a final decision made after the normal deposit deadline of May 1. While the deposit deadline for incoming students was extended to June 1, we know already the additional expenses incurred from this crisis does not allow the College to provide across the board salary increases for the next fiscal year.
We realize this will have an impact on you and your families during these uncertain economic times. The senior staff and I remain committed to supporting our employees and the College. I will be taking a 10% salary reduction for at least the first six months of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Senior staff are contributing on average four percent of their salaries across the same time period to the student emergency fund or financial aid to support our students.
Contributions to Retirement: Effective September 1, we will temporarily reduce the Collegeâs retirement contribution from 10 percent to 4 percent. We hope to restore the 10 percent contribution in the next fiscal year.
Furloughs: When we moved to remote learning and work, we decided that all employees would receive their regular pay no matter their work situation until April 13. We then moved that date to May 23. We are able to continue to support every employee at the regular pay until May 31.
As many other colleges and universities have already announced, we made the difficult decision to partially or fully furlough employees who are either unable to perform their core job duties remotely or whose capacity to work effectively has been limited due to the current status of college operations. The furloughs will begin June 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020. During that time, some employees will not be working. For others, their regular working hours have been reduced. Muhlenberg will continue to pay for the employer portion of current medical and vision insurance for these employees. Employees on full or partial furloughs may file for state unemployment compensation benefits and federal support. Unemployment compensation includes an additional weekly supplement of $600 through the end of July as part of the CARES Act for which employees may qualify. 
Employees who will go on full or partial furloughs have been in discussions with their supervisor. An FAQ is available from HR. These decisions are in no way reflective of anyoneâs job performance and we look forward to returning to our regular schedules as soon as possible.
Open Positions: The senior staff reviewed current open administrative positions and put half of these on hold with departments able to absorb the positionsâ responsibilities given our current level of college operations. All open faculty positions will be similarly reviewed.
Faculty and Staff Travel: We are eliminating nonessential travel for faculty and staff for the rest of the calendar year. All essential travel will be approved by the appropriate vice president or the provost.
Other Cost Cutting Measures: The College closely reviewed and trimmed the 20-21 budget. In addition, senior staff are reviewing all renovation and construction projects. Some projects will move forward to ensure safety and compliance standards or because the College had already purchased most of the materials and equipment to complete these projects.
When I was appointed to lead this College in June 2019, I never imagined that our lives and our College would experience a disruption of the magnitude that we have seen in the past few months. Yet, even amidst significant and sudden change, the faculty, staff and students of Muhlenberg rallied to a new way of teaching, working and living as a community. This crisis has shown the best of our College. I am so grateful to be a member of this community, our Muhlenberg community. As we face more difficult decisions and challenges, I promise to be open and honest with you and to work collaboratively to steer Muhlenberg toward a strong and bright future. 
I look forward to when we can be back together on campus.  Thank you for your commitment to Muhlenberg and our community. 
Sincerely,Kathy HarringInterim President

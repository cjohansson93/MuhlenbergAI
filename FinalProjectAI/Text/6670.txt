Track Teams Open Up Season at Kutztown
 Friday, January 11, 2013







					 


In her first race of the season, sophomore Cassiah Sahl was approaching the back turn on the mile when a photographer accidentally walked across the track, right in her path. Sahl, a former field hockey player, successfully dodged him and went on place fourth in the race.




Junior Jarrett Felix placed third in the 800 meters.



It was an indication that the Muhlenberg track and field teams are ready to have a successful season, no matter what the obstacles in their path.

The Mules got off to a good start at the Kutztown Invitational, combining outstanding performances by veterans and newcomers.




Junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski improved her personal best by eight hundredths of a second and joined classmate Stephanie Carnevale in qualifying for the finals in the 55-meter hurdles.



The most impressive came from senior Samantha Mayden, who ran away with the 3,000 meters in the first running event of the meet. Mayden beat her closest competitor (freshman teammate Melanie Tramontina) by 48 seconds and beat her personal record – set in 2011 on a banked track – by nearly four seconds.

Junior Lauren Zakheim had a couple of second-place finishes, one in the 4x400 relay and the other in the 500. Her time in the latter race was good for fourth on the Mules’ all-time performance list. Freshman Claire Thornton, in the first track race of her Muhlenberg career, landed at No. 8 on the performance list in the same event.

Three other members of the women’s team earned spots on the performance list: senior Erica Bash in the mile (sixth), freshman Ashley Riley in the long jump (seventh)
and freshman Katrina Faust in the pole vault.

The men had five third-place finishes, one in the 3,000 meters by senior Brendan Smith, who ran 6.10 seconds faster than he did in the same meet last year. Smith was the first college runner across the finish line in the 3K.

Senior Isaiah Vaughn came in third, second among college runners, in the 200 meters.

Three freshmen – Michael Schwarz, Brandon Tauber and James Knight – made the finals in the triple jump. Schwarz came in sixth, landing in ninth place on the Muhlenberg performance list. Knight made ninth place on the performance list in the 55 hurdles, knocking out of the top 10 junior Scott Reutter, even though he improved his personal best by three hundredths of a second.

Volleyball Fights Off Slow Start to Down Owls

From the opening serve of its match at Bryn Mawr, the Muhlenberg volleyball team looked uncomfortable and out of sync.

So when the Mules fell behind 16-7 in the first set, they called timeout to try to settle down.

The message in the huddle did wonders, because when play resumed, Muhlenberg looked like a totally different team. Balls that had fallen before got dug, passes found their marks and the offense started to click.

The Mules rallied to take the first set, 25-23. They carried

that solid play to a win in the second set before stumbling in the third. In the fourth, Muhlenberg led from the start en route to a 25-20 win to take the match, 3-1.

“Coach just told us to fight back,” senior Jackie Price said of the early timeout. “We knew that we could grab a win tonight, but we didn’t play the way we could at the start. We just had to settle down and play our game, and that made the difference.”

The Mules slowly pulled back into the first set thanks in large part to an 11-4 run. They finally pulled even at 20-20 on a kill by senior Brooke McQueen. With the momentum firmly on Muhlenberg’s side, McQueen slammed an overpass down the line to finish the comeback and win the set.

In the second, Muhlenberg jumped ahead 4-0 behind an ace from sophomore Morgan Duggan and a kill from Price. While the Mules were not able to pull much further away, they kept a comfortable lead the entire set before finishing it off for a 25-19 win.

Bryn Mawr (7-9, 3-2) came out fired up in the third before winning, 25-18. But the Mules bounced back in the fourth by once again jumping out to a 4-0 lead on three straight kills from Duggan, freshmen Lindsey Gambocurta and Holly Hynson, and another Duggan ace.

They extended their advantage to as much as eight before the Owls screeched back. Bryn Mawr pulled to within 22-19, but the Mules got a kill by Hynson and an ace by freshman Julia Elkin to pull to within one point of the match. Two points later, Price slammed home a kill at the middle of the net to seal the match.

Hynson led the offense with 11 kills, while Price added 10 to go along with three blocks. Duggan dished out 23 assists to go with three aces, and freshmen Alyssa Schell and Elkin dug 18 and 13 balls, respectively.
 
With the win, Muhlenberg surpassed its Centennial Conference win total from all of last season. The Mules have already won three CC matches at the midpoint of this year’s conference season.

“This was another big win for us,” said Price. “It lets us know we can beat some high-powered offenses. We did a great job of battling back tonight, and I am so proud of all of the girls on the team. We are feeling very confident right now, so hopefully we can keep it going.”

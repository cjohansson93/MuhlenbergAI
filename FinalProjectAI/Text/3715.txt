Cronin Named Runner of the Week; No. 1 Soccer Team Coming to Town



Freshman Nicole Cronin of the Muhlenberg women's cross country team was named runner of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Cronin was the top Division III finisher, coming in eighth overall, at Lafayette's Leopard Invitational on Saturday. She was beaten only by five runners from Division I and two from Division II. Her time of 22:22.9 was the best by a Mule on a 6K course since 2005.

Cronin's run helped Muhlenberg finish sixth, 22 points ahead of Moravian, the only other Division III team in the field.

The top-ranked men's soccer team in Division III is coming to Allentown.

Swarthmore moved to the top of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America national poll following a loss by then-No. 1 Christopher Newport last week. The first men's soccer team in Centennial Conference history to be ranked No. 1 in the country, the Garnet will visit varsity field for a showdown against Muhlenberg next Wednesday.

In the D3soccer.com poll, Messiah is No. 1 and Swarthmore is No. 3. The Mules are 19th in both rankings.

With Stevens losing to Rutgers-Newark and Wisconsin-Whitewater falling to North Park, Swarthmore (11-0-2) and Muhlenberg (8-0-5) are two of only four undefeated teams remaining in Division III.




You win some, you lose some.

That's the case for Muhlenberg senior golfer Zachary Oyer, who tied for 



second place at the Messiah Falcon Classic. It was the second straight day that Oyer tied for the runner-up spot, but while he won the match of cards to take home the second-place trophy at yesterday's Muhlenberg Fall Classic, at Messiah he had to concede second place to a golfer from Elizabethtown.

The Mules finished third at their final tournament of the fall, four strokes behind Messiah and Hood. Of their six fall tournaments, the Mules won two and finished second once and third twice.

Oyer (above) also had an excellent fall season, shooting in the 70s in all but one round and averaging 77.0 strokes per round.

Sophomore Brandon Davis tied for fifth at Messiah, one stroke behind Oyer.

Matthew Allar  Class of 2000 Major in Theatre, Minor in English
Freelance Designer, Scenographer/Assistant Professor of Theatrical Design





After graduating from Muhlenberg, and designing scenery for the MSMT production of Forever Plaid (the first MSMT production in the newly opened Baker Center For The Arts), I moved to New York City to work as a design assistant for Spaeth Design, a firm specializing in thematic window display for many of the department stores which draw crowds during the Holiday season.  The position was offered to me following an internship I completed with the same group during the Fall Semester of my senior year.  The industrial work afforded me the chance to develop professional drafting and model building skills, which I later relied on as a freelance designer and assistant to several NYC based designers for a range of Broadway, Off Broadway, and Regional productions.  The mixture of experience with both theatrical and industrial design work led me to additional work as a designer for MTV Networks until I headed back to academia as a graduate student at New York University.  After completing the program at NYU, I returned to a similar blend of projects until accepting my first teaching position, which led to my current appointment at the College of William and Mary.
Like many of my classmates, and current students, I entered Muhlenberg with a deep interest in theatre, as well as an investment in broad academic study.   The commitment of the faculty, not only in Theatre and Dance, but throughout the entire College to ensure the success of each student was readily apparent from start to finish.  Additionally, I was introduced to many notable guest artists, many of which I am still in contact with today.  As a Muhlenberg student, I was encouraged to develop my enjoyment of theatre into a strong set of professional skills, which in turn, have led me to the career I have today.

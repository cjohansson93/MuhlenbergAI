Common Ground Research Networks has announced the selection of In Exchange for Gold: The Legacy and Sustainability of Artisanal Gold Mining in Las Juntas de Abangares, Costa Rica by Biology Professor Richard A. Niesenbaum and Emeritus Professor of Art Joseph E.B. Elliot as the winner of the annual Publishers Prize. 
The book was recognized as âa rare collaboration between a natural scientist and a documentary photographer [which] documents the linkage between human experience and ecology.â It was selected by a committee of research network chairs, current authors, advisory board members, partners and scholars in the field from all the titles published by Common Ground Research Networks in 2019.
According to press materials announcing the award, Niesenbaum and Elliott, whose photography is featured in the book, ârender a nuanced understanding of the complex issues involved in developing sustainable approaches to protecting the environment and how those approaches might also respect the communities and individuals inextricably tied to gold. Highlighting the personal, this case study honors a community, its rich culture and history, while simultaneously examining the environmental and human cost of gold extraction.â
The award committee praised the authorsâ overarching methodological approach, noting that âthis case study reveals the environmental and human cost of gold mining, but does so in a way that draws the reader's attention to the lived implications of these practices. The committee applauded the ways in which In Exchange for Gold interweaves critical analysis, compelling narrative and thoughtful imagery. The committee also appreciated the timely and critical nature of this work and its examination of the complex issues involved in developing sustainable approaches to protecting the environment that also honor the communities and individuals involved in mining for gold.â
The Publishers Prize recognizes authors and series editors of exceptional books published by Common Ground Research Networks within the last calendar year. The award seeks to promote academic research that contributes to emerging and timely debates and to foster scholarship that advances social equity and justice.

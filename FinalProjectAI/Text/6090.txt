Wrestlers Shine In Final Tri-Match
 Saturday, February 18, 2012 - page 3







					 



The bonus points keep coming for the Muhlenberg wrestling team.

In their final action before next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships, the Mules got a clean sweep during their tri-match with Johns Hopkins at Scranton, with every win registering bonus points.

Muhlenberg wrestlers went 6-for-6, including 5-0 in contested bouts, with four pins and a major decision.

Senior John Sternlicht had the most impressive day, needing just 77 combined seconds to pick up two pins at 174 pounds. In the opener against Scranton, he decked his opponent in 33 seconds. He followed that up with another first-period fall against the Blue Jays in 44 ticks for his 10th win of the season.

 Classmate Kevin Homan was the only Mule to not record a pin against the Royals, but he still performed well, picking up his third major decision of the season, 11-2, at 149 pounds. Then against the Blue Jays, he pinned his opponent in 4:35 to improve his record to 28-7 on the year.

Senior heavyweight Nick Pallotta (right) just beat the buzzer to pick up a first-period pin at the 2:53 mark against Scranton and added a win by forfeit against the Blue Jays. Five of his six contested wins this season have come by fall.

The Mules outscored Scranton 16-0 in contested bouts, but counting forfeits fell 36-16. Muhlenberg held a 12-0 edge over Johns Hopkins in contested bouts, but lost 42-18 with forfeits.

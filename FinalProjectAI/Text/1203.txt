List of Mentors
Eugene Fiorini (16)*
Eugene Fiorini is the Truman Koehler Professor of Mathematics at Muhlenberg College and is a former associate director for the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. Fiorini brings seven years of experience to this program with several publications on organizing and implementing REU programs. While DIMACS associate director, Fiorini managed the DIMACS/CCICADA/Rutgers Math joint REU program. He was recognized for expanding the diversity of the program along multiple facets: ethnic, geographic, gender, and economic. Fiorini also introduced several innovations to the program including developing a graduate assistant mentor program which he hopes to adopt at Muhlenberg College. Fiorini is a regular contributor to the OEIS database. Approved submissions include several new variations on sequence A105403 (A259559, A259562, and A259564), sequences A260373 (the nearest perfect square to n!) and A260374 (the distance between n! and the nearest perfect square), as well as several updates and additions to existing sequences.
 
Byungchul Cha (16)
Byungchul Cha is an associate professor in the Muhenberg College Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. He received his Ph.D. in 2003 from Johns Hopkins University. After teaching at Hendrix College for three years, he joined Muhlenberg College in 2007. His research interests lie in number theory, especially in the area related to distribution of prime numbers in the context of function fields. He advised many undergraduate independent research projects at Hendrix College and Muhlenberg College.
 
Allison Davidson (16) 
Allison Davidson is an Assistant Professor at Muhlenberg College, teaching statistics in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science. She received a Ph.D. in Statistics in 2014 from Purdue University, and immediately following joined the faculty at Muhlenberg College. Her research interests include statistics education, urn models, and applied probability. She has worked with several undergraduate students, advising independent research projects in statistics. 
 
James Hammer (16, 17)
James Hammer is an assistant professor of Mathematics at Cedar Crest College.  He received his PhD in 2015 from Auburn University in Design Theory. After teaching at Auburn university as a graduate teaching assistant, he went to Cedar Crest College in 2015.  His primary area of research are Structural Graph Theory and Design Theory.  He enjoys research in graph decompostions, latin squares, graph coloring, and graph domination to name a few topics. With respect to latin squares, he has done a lot of work on a particular type of multiple gerechte designs called factor pair latin squares. In addition to studying graphs and combinatorial designs, he also enjoy working on elementary number theory problems, enumeration problems, and other combinatorial puzzles.
 
Joshua Harrington (16, 17)
Joshua Harrington received his PhD from the University of South Carolina under the advisement of Michael Filaseta in December 2013. He is currently an Assistant Professor and Chair of the Cedar Crest College Mathematics Department. Number theory is his primary area of research, focusing on studying the irreducibility or reducibility properties of polynomials, as well as studying properties and applications of covering systems of the integers. Additional research interests extend to areas of combinatorics, algebra, and analysis. Several OEIS sequences reference two of Harringtonâs recent research publications. His publication "Characterizing Finite Groups Using the Sum of the Orders of the Elements," is referenced in sequences A060014 and A060015. A second publication "Representing Integers as the Sum of Two Squares in the Ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$" is referenced in sequences A000404, A240109, and A240370.
 
Kellen Myers (16)
Kellen Myers is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Farmingdale State College. He received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 2015, specializing in computational Ramsey theory. As a graduate student Myers worked closely with PI Fiorini as the DIMACS REU graduate coordinator in 2011 and 2012 assisting in organizing and implementing all aspects of the program. Myersâs responsibilities included coordinating speakers for the weekly seminar, field trips to industry partners, and workshops on such topics as the graduate school application process and ethical behavior in scientific research. Myers also assisted Fiorini in organizing the 2013 NSF CISE REU PI meeting. Myers is an OEIS assistant editor and frequent contributor to the database. His contributions have included refinements to existing sequences (A134971, A164844, A254233, and A130734), comments and examples clarifying sequential terms and properties (A049094, A053451, A105633, A164844, and A002137), and code to generate additional terms and sequences (A134971 and A182938).
 
Nathan Shank (16, 17)
Nathan Shank is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Moravian College. Immediately after completing his PhD at Lehigh University, Dr. Shank joined the Moravian College faculty in 2006. Dr. Shank was previously an adjunct for the college teaching service courses and evening classes for non-traditional students. Dr. Shank enjoys teaching all mathematics major courses as well as mathematics courses for non-math majors. His research interests include analysis, stochastic processes, probability theory, graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Dr. Shank enthusiasm for learning fuels his willingness to work individually with students on research projects and special topics courses. For the past 5 years he has served as the director of the Moravian College Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science Program (MCS2) which provided scholarships, resources, research experience, and academic support for transfer students in mathematics and computer science.
 
Shannon Talbott (17)
Shannon Talbott is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Moravian College. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in 2012. Her research interests include representation theory of finite dimensional algebras and dimension theory of partially ordered sets. She is also involved in programs to promote diversity in STEM such as SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) and USTARS (Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium).

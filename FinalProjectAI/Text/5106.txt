men’s soccer enjoys outburst at wilkes



  



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team flourished on its first road trip of the season, posting a convincing 4-0 win at Wilkes to avenge a home loss to the Colonels last year.

The Mules (2-2) had a 16-3 advantage in shots and put the game away with three goals in a span of 12:09 early in the second half, allowing many reserves to get their first
varsity playing time.

The first goal was set up when senior Johan Steiner settled the ball at midfield and patiently waited to find an open teammate. He passed to the left wing and junior Mike Williams,
whose cross was converted by senior Eric Miller (above left).

Steiner nearly got a goal of his own later in the 


first half, but after his ball slipped past the goalie (above center), a Wilkes back cleared it before it could cross
the line.

The second-half barrage began when a shot by junior Tom Reilly (above right) was saved by the Colonel goalie. Miller followed the ball in and deposited it into
the empty net for his second goal of the game.

Sophomore Cody Antonini connected on a penalty kick (right) six minutes later after junior Matt Cecconi forced a hand ball on a run through the box. The goal
was the fourth in as many games for Antonini; he is the first Mule since Ed Mullane in 1984 to score a goal in each of the first four games of a season.

Reilly finished a cross from Miller for his first goal of the season to close out the scoring.

The five points were a career high for Miller.

Muhlenberg has scored four goals in both of its wins. The last time the Mules scored at least four goals twice in the first four games was the “Final Four”
season of 1995.

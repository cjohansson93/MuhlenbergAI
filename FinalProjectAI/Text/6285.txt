Women's Lacrosse Succumbs to Haverford's Second-Half Surge
 Wednesday, March 28, 2012







					 



The afternoon thunder and lightning moved out of the Lehigh Valley in time to leave perfect conditions for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse game against Haverford.

Unfortunately for the Mules, they ran into a storm of a different kind as Haverford blew open a one-goal game with an 11-3 second-half run to win, 18-11.

Nine different Mules found the back of the net, but the balanced attack was not enough because none scored more than twice against a Ford team that has qualified for Centennial Conference playoffs each of the past two seasons.

Junior Molly Davin put the Mules (4-3, 0-3) on the board first when she left a defender in her dust with a quick spin move and fired a bounce shot between the Ford goalie’s legs less than three minutes in.

Just 28 seconds later, senior Kelsey Elmer got a pass behind the cage, streaked past a defender in front of the net and beat the keeper with a sidearm shot to the lower right corner to make it 2-0.

Haverford (4-5, 2-1) answered with its first goal at the 22:05 mark, before junior Alexandra Gabriele scored on a free-position shot to make it 3-1.

But that would be Muhlenberg’s last lead of the day. Haverford scored six of the next eight goals to pull ahead by two with 2:07 to play in the half. Two of those goals came 19 seconds apart when the Mules were whistled for a yellow card during a Ford goal and forced to play a man down on the next possession, which led to another goal.

Muhlenberg got a late boost right before the break. Junior Alex Bellini (left) picked up an errant pass in the Ford zone and found sophomore 
Ally Shaffer, who beat the goalie to the lower right on a one-on-one opportunity to pull the Mules within one with 1:20 left in the half.

But Haverford scored the first five goals of the second half and then scored twice for each of Muhlenberg’s next three goals to cruise to the win. The Mules had some chances to get back in the game, but many of their shots seemed to find the Ford goalie’s crosse.

Bellini (2 G, 1 A) and sophomore Michelle Certosimo (1 G, 2 A) led the Mules with three points apiece. Certosimo moved into a tie for 16th on the school single-season assists list with 14, one shy of the top 15.

Elmer added an assist to her goal, and freshman Stephanie Umbach had another solid game, scoring twice, causing three turnovers and grabbing a game-high eight draw controls, two off the school record.

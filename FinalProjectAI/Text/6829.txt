Women's Lacrosse Shuts Out Merchant Marine
 Saturday, March 16, 2013 - page 2







					 



So far this season, bad weather has meant a good outcome for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team.

The Mules (3-1) defeated Merchant Marine, 14-0, on another snow-filled afternoon to record just the second shutout in program history (the first was back in 2005 with an 18-0 victory over Chestnut Hill).

Muhlenberg struck quickly, scoring each of its first four goals less than a minute after the first four draw controls, and took a 4-0 lead just 2:23 into the game.




Mital's first career goal was the Mules' 14th and final of the day.



Junior Ally Shaffer, who scored the first goal of the game and the first goal of the second half after less than a minute of action each time, and sophomore Stephanie Umbach led the offensive effort with two goals apiece. They were two of 11 Mules to net goals during the game.

Four players scored their first career goals. Junior Rachel Chinman found the back of the net with 18:02 remaining in the first half to give Muhlenberg a 7-0 lead. 
Sophomore Christina Vittorio made it 12-0 with 10:06 left, freshman Danielle Levin scored with just under two minutes to play, and junior Kelsey Mital put away a free-position shot with 37 seconds remaining.

Also scoring goals were seniors Molly Davin and Ali Gabriele, junior Michelle Certosimo and freshmen Brigid Noone and Casey Armstrong. (corrected 3/18)

Dishing out assists were Certosimo, Davin, Gabriele and Shaffer. Certosimo leads the team with nine assists on the year and is just two away from moving into ninth place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

Umbach tallied seven draw controls, bringing her season total to 26.

On the defensive end, Noone led the team with three caused turnovers. She also had three ground balls and freshman Arielle Sherman added a game-high five.




Gabriele has four points this year (on three goals and an assist) and is more than halfway to her point total from all last season.



Muhlenberg gave up just two shots to the Mariners (0-4), who are in their first season as a varsity sport, and senior goalie Tiffany Kreider made one save in her half of action.

Kreider has been the Mules’ starting goalie since joining the team last year as a junior.

“At the time, I was still playing field hockey and I knew that the lacrosse team was searching for a goalie,” explained Kreider of how she ended up on the team. “I kind of made a joke saying, ‘Oh, I’ll do it.’ And then I just walked onto the field, took some shots and I’ve loved it ever since.”

In four games this season, Kreider, whose high school didn’t have a lacrosse team until her senior year, has a record of 3-1 and a goals-against average of 9.67.

“I would say that some of my best college memories come from this team. I love my teammates – we’re all a family. We get along so well and we’re always together. 

“I can remember playing in my first game here and it was the best day in the world,” she added. “I still have that feeling every time I step on the field and it’s because of my teammates.”

As a collective unit, Kreider and her teammates are averaging 16.4 goals per game this season and are giving up just 7.3.

With one more win, Muhlenberg will match its 4-1 start last season and extend its winning streak to four.

“We lost that first game by one goal and that’s kind of been our motivator,” stated Kreider. “We’re coming out every day and competing hard and pushing each other, and Coach is making sure that she pushes us too. I think the sky is the limit at this point – this team can do anything. We have so much talent and I think that it’s only going to get better for us.”

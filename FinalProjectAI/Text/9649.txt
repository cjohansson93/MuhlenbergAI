Series of short plays to feature classic Ionesco play, world-premiere coming-of-age superhero comedy, on the Studio Theatre stage, Nov. 29-Dec. 3

Muhlenbergâs Theatre & Dance Department continues its âNew Voices / New Visionsâ series Nov 29 through Dec. 3, with an evening of short experimental productions. The series showcases the talents of up-and-coming playwrights and directors, in a venue that encourages artistic risk-taking and experimentation.
In this edition, Brydon Geisler directs EugÃ¨ne Ionescoâs iconic absurdist play âThe Bald Soprano.â Irene Martinko directs âConform,â a world premiere play by Joe McNaney about a teenager with Tourette Syndrome and superhero fantasies.
In âThe Bald Soprano,â what begins as a thoroughly mundane conversation between two couples devolves into a struggle to stay sane. Ionescoâs iconic 1950 masterpiece depicts a shifting reality, in which secrets are revealed and time is ultimately an illusion.
âWhatâs unique about this experience is that this play doesnât use the typical naturalism that preliminary acting classes preach,â Geisler says. âThis play doesnât play by the same rules. It forces the cast to look beyond traditional methods of performance, which is freeing and scary.â
Romanian-French playwright Ionesco was one of the foremost figures of the French avant-garde theater. Beyond ridiculing the most banal situations, Ionesco's plays depict the solitude and insignificance of human existence in a tangible way. âThe Bald Soprano,â his best known play, was first produced in Paris in 1950.
Although it went unnoticed at first, the play was eventually championed by a few established writers and critics and, in the end, won critical acclaim. By the 1960s, âThe Bald Sopranoâ had already been recognized as a modern classic and an important seminal work in the Theatre of the Absurd.
âI love this play. It gives everyone a headache when we try to rehearse it, but thatâs the joy of it!â Geisler says. âWe get to dive deep into a theatrical frontier where meaning loses meaning and plot loses relevance. Thereâs something to the mystery of the play that makes each discovery feel profound. It feels like weâre uncovering new truths about the world at every rehearsal.â
âConformâ is a coming-of-age comedy with a twist. Sam, a teenager with Touretteâs Syndrome, battles his way through high school with the help of his imagined superhero persona. This fast-paced, incisive play examines the nature of masculinity and ponders whether disabilities may sometimes seem like superpowers in disguise.
Playwright Joe McNaney is a 2017 graduate of Muhlenbergâs Theatre Program. He currently lives in Chicago, where he is pursuing a career in comedy. âConformâ reflects his own history growing up with Tourette Syndrome and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
âThere was not enough attention paid to these people because they were different,â McNaney writes in his introduction to the play. âThere was not enough money given to help these people because we had a good football team. I love football. There were not enough committed teachers to help these people because they were asked to do too muchâ¦. I hope this play addresses that.â
Martinko says her job as director has been to find both the humor and fantasy of McNaneyâs play â but at the same time to find the underlying insights.
âThe play is this ridiculous, over the top, hilarious comedy,â Martinko says. âBut itâs also deeply personal and truthful, and thatâs why I was initially drawn to it. Weâre telling a simple coming-of-age story about a high school student with a disability, and thatâs really at the core of this piece. But I think that people might be surprised by the way that weâre telling it.â
McNaney notes that, due to the nature of Tourette Syndrome, the play contains some harsh, potentially offensive language.
âI would ask that you attempt to look into why the language is being used,â he says, âas opposed to letting strong language distract from the rest of the play.â
Martinko says this project is unlike any sheâs worked on before.
âThis has easily been one of the most challenging shows that Iâve ever worked on, but also definitely one of the most fun,â she says. âWeâre constantly laughing through rehearsals and Iâm so excited to share that laughter with an audience.â
âNew Voices / New Visions 2â is intended or mature audiences. Performances will take place in the Studio Theatre, in the Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance. Showtimes are Wednesday, Nov. 29 through Friday, Dec. 1, at 8 p.m.; Saturday, Dec. 2, at 2 and 8 p.m., and Sunday, Dec. 3, at 2 p.m.
Tickets are $15. Youth and student tickets are $8. Tickets and information are available at muhlenberg.edu/theatre or 484-664-3333.

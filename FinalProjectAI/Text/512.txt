Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to share a new body of work by the multidisciplinary artist Claire Lieberman in our main exhibition space. The opening reception will be on March 10, 6 â 7:30pm. Lieberman's solo show features highly polished black marble sculptures installed in a dynamic, game-like format and related cast paper prints. Her project explores the relationship between play and conflict in contemporary culture. While on campus, Lieberman plans to offer a stone carving workshop for advanced sculpture students, and additionally, the exhibition will be accompanied by a catalog, with essay by Nancy Princenthal.

Cross country teams at their best at lehigh



No Miracle for Field Hockey This Time


The Muhlenberg field hockey team couldn’t muster any late-game magic and had its four-game winning streak snapped with a 2-1 home loss to Dickinson.

The Red Devils (3-6, 1-2) scored two goals four minutes apart in the first half to jump on top. The Mules (6-3, 2-1) had a 7-1 advantage in penalty corners in the first 35 minutes but could not put one in.

Muhlenberg finally closed the gap with 21:16 left in the game when senior Tara Cohn converted a penalty stroke for her team-leading eighth goal of the season. Muhlenberg was awarded the stroke when a Dickinson back stopped Cohn’s shot, which would have been a sure goal, with her body.

The Mules had several chances to tie the score, including a penalty corner with time expired, but came up short. Eight of their nine games have been decided by a single goal.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams competed in the 36th annual Brooks Paul Short Run, a large meet at Lehigh that consisted of 14 separate races at the college and high school levels.

Both Mule teams ran in the “White” division and did very well. The men placed 10th out of 29 complete teams, and the women were 12th out of 32 teams.

Most importantly, many of the Muhlenberg athletes who had run on the same course previously recorded lifetime bests. 

For the varsity men, junior Bobby Torphy, senior Patrick Thornton and sophomores Ryan Ganley (right)  and William Lowery ran their best times. Torphy came in sixth out of 245 runners to lead the Mules, while Thornton was 38th

For the women, six of the seven varsity runners improved on their times from the Lehigh Valley Championships, which were run at Lehigh the first week of September. Sophomore Melissa Ugelow lowered her time by 1:19 to come in 23rd, five places behind junior Kate Mahoney in the 248-runner field.

The Muhlenberg teams will run again at Lehigh when they host the NCAA Mideast Regional in November.

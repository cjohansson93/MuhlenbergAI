women’s basketball doesn’t waitto get jump on f&m


Its said that good things come to those who wait. And for the Muhlenberg womens basketball team it was some early hot shooting and late transition baskets that came after having to wait an extra day to play Franklin & Marshall.

The Mules knocked down nine of their first 11 shots to grab a double-digit lead less than five 




McKeon finished with 7 points and 7 assists. (revised 2/15/11)




minutes into the game and never looked back as they cruised to a 71-56 win in Lancaster.

We were all really mad that we couldnt play yesterday so we wanted to just come out and get on top early and take it to them, freshman Leeann Lanza said. Weve been in a lot of games that have been close at halftime and we didnt want that to happen again.

Lanza got the scoring started with a layup before a trio of Alexandra 3-pointers, two from junior Alexandra Chili and one from senior Alexandra 




Zabrecky tied for the team lead with 8 rebounds.




Berlin, and a Lanza jumper gave the Mules a quick 13-3 lead less than five minutes into the game.

Muhlenberg (15-5, 11-4) would eventually stretch its lead to 15 and go into the break up 40-25.

But the Diplomats (11-10, 9-7) mounted a mini comeback after halftime and pulled 
to within six with 12 minutes to play when the Mules found an extra gear.

First, senior Kelly McKeon found sophomore Alita Zabrecky for an easy transition layup. Then after a Lanza steal, McKeon again took off on the fast break and found Chili alone on the left wing for 3.

Two more Zabrecky layups and a Chili jumper pushed the Mules even further ahead. And by the time Zabrecky made another layup in transition 
with eight minutes to play, the Mules had a 15-2 run that put the game out of reach.

We had to calm ourselves down at that point, said Lanza, who finished with a career-high 12 points. We have these spurts when we get up and then feel like we have to keep pushing and pushing. But that actually messes us up even more so we have to slow down and play our game, and thats what we did today.

Chili led all scorers with 20 points, including four threes, while Zabrecky added 14.

And after the game the players showered quickly and hurried back to Allentown to get ready to celebrate in what Lanza called the best way possible: watching the Super Bowl at junior Kathleen Naddaffs house with plenty of pizza and wings.

This was a really big win for us, Lanza said. I think we played really well and Im very happy right now.

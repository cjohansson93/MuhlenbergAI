Mr. BurnsA Post-Electric Play
Feb. 20-24, 2019
The world as we know it has come to an end. Electricity is a memory. The survivors gaze into the fire and conjure up memories of Simpsons episodes to entertain themselves. Seven years later, these stories have become a primitive entertainment industry. Seventy-five years later still, the stories have evolved into an elaborate mythology.
By turns harrowing and hilarious, Anne Washburnâs riveting play explores the power of storytelling and asking what happens when media becomes myth â and myth becomes something more.
âDownright brilliantâ âThe New York Times.
For mature audiences.
Wednesday, Feb. 20, 8 p.m.Thursday, Feb. 21, 8 p.m.Friday, Feb. 22, 8 p.m.Saturday, Feb. 23, 2 & 8 p.m.Sunday, Feb. 24, 2 p.m.

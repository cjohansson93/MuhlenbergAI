men’s lacrosse defeated in overtime


Close, but no cigar.

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team came back twice 



Freshman Corey Aferiat notched his team-leading fifth assist of the season on Jacobson’s first goal.



in the second half to force overtime, but 14th-ranked Haverford scored a man-up goal 35 seconds into the extra period for an 8-7 win.

The game finished a stretch of three straight games against nationally ranked teams to open the Centennial Conference season for the Mules. For the second year in a row, they lost all three, with one of the losses coming at home in overtime (last year to Washington).

In 2008, Muhlenberg rebounded from its 0-3 CC start to win its next five games and qualify for the CC playoffs.

The Mules hope history will repeat this year. For a while in the Haverford game, it looked like more-recent history would repeat. Just like Saturday’s home opener against Gettysburg, Muhlenberg trailed 4-3 at halftime, then gave up the first two goals of the second half.

But this time, the Mules came back. Junior Ari Jacobson scored three straight 


Softball Swept



The Muhlenberg softball team managed only two hits, one in each game, and was swept at New Jersey, 9-0 and 2-0. The Mules have never beaten the Lions in 32 all-time games.

Freshman Maggie Scarpelli hit a double in the second game.

goals, the last coming with 5:58 left in the fourth quarter, to tie the score at 6-6.

Haverford (6-2, 2-0) won the ensuing faceoff and scored just 14 seconds later to retake the lead, 7-6. The Muhlenberg defense held on the Fords’ next two possessions, and with 2:05 on the clock, senior John DeLuca finished a run down the field with his second goal of the season, knotting the score again.

Sophomore Mike Horowitz saved a shot with less than a minute left in regulation, then intercepted a pass from behind the cage. The Mules cleared the ball and called timeout with 38.5 seconds to go, but could not get off a shot in the remaining time.

Haverord won the overtime faceoff, and Travis Gregory scored the game-winning goal on a straight-on shot 11 seconds after Muhlenberg was called for a holding penalty.

The Fords have won all seven meetings with the Mules since 2003, all by five goals or fewer.

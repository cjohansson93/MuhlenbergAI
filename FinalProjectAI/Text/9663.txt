Summer Research Collaborations
In Summer Research Collaborations, a faculty member recruits a student as a research collaborator for the summer. That is, the student assists in a substantive way with the faculty memberâs scholarship. A joint application must be submitted by the faculty member and the student. Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a $3,000 stipend for eight weeks of research during the summer and the option of one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost to the student. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with campus housing (based on double occupancy). Recipients also participate in the summer research community and present in the Celebration of Student Research and Scholarship poster session at the discretion of their faculty mentor. Students may not have other obligations (work, course work, etc.) during the work period. In addition, the student is expected to be enrolled at Muhlenberg in Fall 2022.
Joint Research Application
Applications will be due by Friday March 25th at 11:59 pm.

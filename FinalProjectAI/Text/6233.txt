Good as Gold for Mules on Final Day of CC Track Championships
 Sunday, May 6, 2012







					 





Muhlenberg’s 2012 CC outdoor gold medalists (from left to right): Tyler Bauer, Andrew Onimus, Kyle Sullivan, Erin Saucier, Peter Rice, Isaiah Vaughn, Darnell Davis and Jake Ullmann.



The sprinters on the Muhlenberg men’s track and field team know the luxury they have sitting at the back end of both the 4x100 and 4x400 relays. 

With senior Peter Rice manning the anchor leg, his teammates know that if they’re anywhere near the front at the final exchange, Rice will find a way to pull out the win.

So it was only fitting that the final day of the Centennial Conference Championships began and ended with Rice leading Mule relay teams to gold medals while breaking school records.

Led by four gold medals, including three for Rice, the men’s team finished fourth overall, 41 points ahead of fifth. The women’s squad, which did not have a senior compete the entire weekend, finished seventh.

The men got off to a blazing start when the 4x100 relay team Rice, senior Kyle Sullivan, junior Isaiah Vaughn and sophomore Darnell Davis broke the school record and tied the 17-year-old conference mark to win gold in a time of 42.23. The Mules tied the CC Championship record to win the 4x100 for the fourth straight.




Bauer won Muhlenberg’s first gold in the javelin since 2005.




While Rice was able to cruise fairly comfortably to the first win, he had to come from behind to help the Mules close out the day with their second straight CC 4x400 crown.

After solid legs by sophomore Andrew Onimus, Davis and sophomore Jake Ullmann, Rice got the baton in third place. He started to make his move coming out of the first turn and got to the front along the back straightaway. He would not be caught, and the Mules broke another school record in a time of 3:19.35.

“He’s the fastest guy in the conference, so you know he can make up a lot of distance if he has to,” Sullivan said of Rice. “He is just incredible; it’s awesome to be on his team.”




In between relay wins, Rice picked up two more medals on his own. He won gold in the 400 and added a silver in the 200, giving him 28 CC medals in his career, including a school-record 16 golds.





While Rice was writing the final chapter to his CC Championship career, freshman Tyler Bauer was busy scripting a dramatic beginning to his. Down to his final throw in the javelin, Bauer launched a toss of 188-8 to take home gold.

His throw was not only seven feet further than his previous best, but also ranks second on the school’s performance list. After struggling to find his rhythm during his early attempts, Bauer said he tried to just stay calm. And when he let go of his final throw, he said he knew it was good.

“I was going a little too fast at the start,” Bauer said. “I was a little nervous, especially since this was my first championship meet. So once I settled in, everything started to click. And the last throw felt good from the first step.”

Senior David Kurtis won bronze in the 400 hurdles and moved up to fourth in school history with a time of 56.38. Sophomore Jeffrey Phillips followed Kurtis in fifth with the ninth-best time on the performance list. Senior Marc Brookland closed out his championship career with a fifth-place finish in the triple jump.

Sullivan and Vaughn gave the Mules medals in every sprint, finishing second and third, just .03 seconds apart, in a tightly contested 100. Sullivan said he thought he originally finished fourth, but then got a welcomed surprise when the results were announced.

“I couldn’t believe it,” he said. “There was a group of us really close, so I had no idea where I was. I actually thought Isaiah was in front of me. When I saw we got second and third I was really pumped.”

On the women’s side, sophomore Stephanie Carnevale picked up the Mules’ first medal of the day, clocking the second-fastest time in school history (15.17) to place third in the 100 hurdles. Junior Tara Keegan picked up a bronze in the javelin for her second medal of the meet. Her toss of 118-4 ranks third on the school’s performance list.

Senior Samantha Mayden finished fourth and fifth in the 5,000 and 1,500, respectively, while sophomore Nicki Cronin moved into third place on the school’s performance list after finishing eighth in the 5,000.

baseball home opener ends in tie



Darkness was the only winner in the home opener for the Muhlenberg baseball team, as the game against Eastern ended in a 4-4 tie.

For the second day in a row, the Mules (2-1-1) rallied from a 3-1 deficit to take a 4-3 lead in the late innings. In the bottom of the seventh, sophomore Joseph Vila tripled in a run and scored the tying run on an RBI single by senior Joseph DiCecilia.

Freshman John Scuderi, whose fourth-inning triple brought in the Mules first run, led off the eighth with a walk, was sacrificed to second, and came home with the go-ahead run on a single by senior Jeff Puklin.

The Eagles scored an unearned run in the top of the ninth. Muhlenberg loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth but could not push across the winning run.

Senior Bobby Spindler went 4-for-4 to lead the Mules 14-hit attack.

Senior Clint Lynch made a couple of big plays behind the plate, picking off a runner from third base with one out in the sixth and throwing
out another trying to steal after a leadoff walk in the seventh. Junior Mike Speroni (left) pitched into the fifth inning and struck out five.

Kimberly Schmidt  Class of 2005 Dual Major in Dance and Theatre
Board Certified Dance/Movement Therapist, Licensed Mental Health Counselor





As my Muhlenberg senior year wound down, I came across an article in Dance Teacher Magazine about Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT). After graduating, I spent the next year researching DMT to see if it was for me. I took psychology courses and applied to graduate schools that offered DMT, ultimately enrolling in Columbia College Chicago in 2006. I started a career that incorporates movement with serving others in the mental health-counseling role. I eventually moved back home to New England, where I now serve as a clinical supervisor at an outpatient substance abuse clinic in Boston. My counseling techniques have a unique perspective, as I weave body awareness, breath, movement and dance into my psychotherapy groups and individual sessions.
Entering grad school was a smooth transition from Muhlenberg because I was used to integrating skills and philosophies that I picked up from different subjects during my liberal arts education.  I already had a feel of how different disciplines inform one another. My dance and theatre training lives on in my current work, particularly my choreographic and directing experiences from Muhlenberg, as I now find myself with the opportunity to creatively lead coworkers and clients. The strength of the Muhlenberg faculty, and the care they take with the education of the students, left a huge impression on me. The culture of striving for breadth and excellence nurtured me to strive for this beyond Muhlenberg in my current challenging role in mental health counseling.

Muha's Six Hits Lead Baseball Past Brandywine
 Friday, March 29, 2013







					 

 Men’s tennis, women’s lacrosse


John Muha’s walkup song is “My Life Be Like” by Grits, 
whose “ooh-aah” lyrics in the intro sound very much like his name. And lately, Muha’s hitting has drawn
plenty of oohs and aahs from Muhlenberg baseball fans.




Junior Tyler Latrenta had two hits, including this bunt single in the fourth.



Muha tied a school record by going 6-for-6 as the Mules defeated Penn State Brandywine, 15-8, in their final game before beginning
Centennial Conference play.

The senior outfielder became the fifth Mule to get six hits in a game, the third to get six hits in six at-bats. He also drew a walk –
only future Major Leaguer Bill Kern, in 1954, reached base in seven plate appearances while getting six hits.

Muha has 13 hits in his last three games, raising his season average to .526.

“I feel great at the plate,” said Muha. “Today everyone was hitting. It started slow, but then we got it going and scored 15 runs.”

It did start slow – Muhlenberg (11-7) had only one run through the first three innings. And everyone was hitting –
the Mules totaled 25 hits, two short of the school record.

Every player in the starting lineup had at least two hits except for senior Jimmy Aramanda, who drove in a team-high four runs. 
Sophomore Kurt Johnson went 4-for-5 and hit his first career home run, a two-run shot to left-center, in a six-run seventh.

Juniors Nick Kennedy and Brett Rosen added three hits apiece.

Muhlenberg trailed 2-1 when it loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the fourth. Aramanda then lifted a fly ball to deep right, and
the right fielder fell down after making the catch. Muha, who was on second base, came all the way around to score behind sophomore 
Danny Usewick for a rare two-run sacrifice fly that put the Mules ahead 3-2.




In addition to this diving catch in right, senior Joseph Vila went 2-for-6, drove in two runs and stole two bases.



Brandywine (4-11) went back in front with three runs in the top of the fifth, but Muhlenberg went ahead for good with five runs in the bottom
of the inning. Rosen had two singles in the inning, and Aramanda had the biggest hit, a line-drive two-out, two-run single to center.

After the Mules extended their lead to 9-5 with a run in the sixth, the Nittany Lions scored three times in the seventh and put the tying run
on third with two out. Sophomore Nick Gies came in to end the rally with a groundout, and pitched the final two innings,
striking out four, to earn the save.

Muhlenberg put the game away with six runs in the bottom of the seventh. Kennedy had two hits in the inning, and a two-run single by
junior John Scuderi preceded Johnson’s blast.

The win got the Mules back on the right track after going 0-4 last weekend.

“This was huge today,” said Muha, who also stole three bases. “Tomorrow the season really starts, and we’ll be able to
go into it feeling better. After today I feel good about our team’s spirits.”

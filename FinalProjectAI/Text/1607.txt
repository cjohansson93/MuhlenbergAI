The Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College proudly hosts Works from the Permanent Collection, June 3 – July 16, 2005. This exhibition offers the public a rare glimpse of some of the diverse artwork—paintings, sculpture and works-on-paper—that are a cherished part of the College’s permanent collection. 
On view is a visual-arts potpourri that ranges from intimate 16 th - century engravings to large-scale contemporary art. This unexpected juxtaposition of old and new work, which depicts varied subjects in a wide range of media, is presented to afford viewers an opportunity to compare art across the centuries and to consider the continuing threads that exist through time in the visual arts.
The earliest works on view are engravings by Northern Renaissance masters Albrecht Durer and Hans Sebald Beham, followed by a Rembrandt etching. Nineteenth-century artists included in the exhibition are American expatriate James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Dutch painter Anton Mauve from the Hague School. Art Nouveau printmaker and graphic designer Theophile A. Steinlen’s work spans both the late-19 th and early-20 th centuries. An elite mix of British and American artists including William Strang, Laura Knight, James McBey, Walter E. Tittle, Earl Stetson Crawford, Arthur B. Davies, Antonio Salemme, and Imogen Cunningham are represented by their work from the first half of the 20 th century. Finally, the work of several contemporary New York artists rounds out the timeline with paintings and mixed media pieces from the 1980s and ‘90s.
The earliest artwork in the exhibition has been culled from the College’s extensive Florence Foerderer Tonner Collection and has been rarely, or never, exhibited. Artwork from more recent decades, generously gifted by alumni, is more frequently on view in public spaces throughout the campus.
Gallery hours are Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon – 9:00 p.m., with extended evening hours for most summer theatre performances. For information, contact Kathryn Burke in the Martin Art Gallery office at 484.664.3467, Mondays through Fridays, 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.

Senior Kristin Garbutt of the Muhlenberg field hockey team was named Centennial Conference defensive player of the week.

Garbutt was part of an outstanding defensive effort in the Mules’ 1-0 upset of No. 6 Johns Hopkins. The defense warded off 25 penalty corners and held the Blue Jays to nine shots – less than half their average – in handing Hopkins its first regular-season CC shutout loss since 2005. Garbutt made a defensive save in the game as well as one in the 5-3 win at Swarthmore.

Garbutt leads the CC with seven defensive saves.

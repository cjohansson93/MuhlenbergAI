 Saturday, May 4, 2013 - page 2







					 


The Muhlenberg women’s track and field team saved the best for last on the second day of the Centennial Conference Championships, setting a school record
in the final event.




The 4x800 relay team of junior Lauren Zakheim, freshman Claire Thornton and seniors Erica Bash
and Samantha Mayden won a silver medal in a school-record time of 9:15.21 to cap a solid day for both Mule teams.

After eight events, the Muhlenberg women were tied for fourth, just four and a half points out of second, and the men were fifth.

Both Mule teams had two placewinners in the discus. For the women, freshman Jessica Thimmel came in fourth and sophomore
Cora Wallace was seventh. Freshman Daniel Cano and senior Jim Gamrat went 4-5 for the men.
It was the third time placing in the discus at the CC meet for Gamrat, who was seventh in 2011 and sixth last year.

Junior Scott Reutter placed fourth in the decathlon with a total of 5,139 points, nearly 800 more than his previous best.

Bash (left), who was on 4x800 team that set the old record of 9:21.87 in 2010, also placed fourth in the steeplechase, missing the school record by less than
four seconds. In the high jump, senior Colette Faust tied for third, and for the men, freshman Brandon Tauber
tied for seventh.

The Mule teams put themselves in position to pick up points on the final day of the meet in qualifying heats. Junior Stephanie Carnevale
qualified for the finals in three events, the 100, 200 and 100 hurdles. Sophomore Kirsten Kuchera (200), junior
Amber Lee Wojtkowski (100 hurdles) and senior Tara Keegan (400 hurdles) also earned spots in Sunday’s finals.

For the men, senior Isaiah Vaughn (100 and 200), junior Andrew Onimus (400, right) and freshman
James Knight (110 hurdles) qualified for finals.

Muhlenberg, however, is no stranger to exceeding preseason polls.

Defending CC champion Johns Hopkins was picked to defend its crown with Franklin & Marshall predicted as runner-up. The Blue Jays received the most first-place votes, 11, while the Diplomats earned seven first-place nods.

League newcomer Susquehanna, which captured the Liberty League title last season, was slotted fourth in the preseason poll, and also received one first-place vote.

Cross Country Teams Dominant at Cedar Crest
 Saturday, September 13, 2014 - page 2







					 




The rain at the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational was on and off, but the reign of the Muhlenberg cross country teams is ongoing.

For the second year in a row, the Mule teams swept the team and individual titles at the annual meet they co-host with Cedar Crest. Since the meet began in 1993, Muhlenberg has swept the team titles six times, but last year was the first time both race winners were Mules.

Both Muhlenberg teams won in dominant fashion. The men had the top five finishers to score a perfect 15 points – the first time they have ever done that (they won with 17 points last year).


Sophomore Jaryd Flank and senior Luke Munyan were the top two runners across the finish line for the second straight year, but in reverse order this time. Flank finished four seconds ahead of Munyan for his first career first-place finish.



Rounding out the top five were seniors Zach Lifman in third and Josh Elkan in fourth and freshman Anthony Calantoni in fifth.

Lifman recorded his best finish after coming in seventh last year, 10th in 2012 and fifth in 2011; he is believed to be  the first person in program history to place in the top 10 in the race four years in a row.

The women also featured a first-time champion in junior Melanie Tramontina, who led a 1-2-3-4 Mule parade across the finish line. Freshmen Mallory Snyder and Emily Davidson were second and third, respectively, with junior Claire Thornton coming in fourth.

Sophomore Kimberly McCarty, who came in 20th at the meet last year, improved to ninth.

Men's Soccer Blanks Moravian for 4th Straight
 Wednesday, September 11, 2013







					 


 Field hockey


Easy did it for senior Jeff Reinhart and the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team.




Reinhart, who scored his first career goal against Washington last year, is in a five-way tie for most career goals (3) among active Mule players.




Choosing placement over power, Reinhart scored two goals for his first career multiple-goal game as the Mules defeated Moravian, 4-0, for their fourth straight shutout win.



The result gave Muhlenberg an early 1-0 lead in the 2013-14 Matte Award race. The next scheduled Matte contest is a field hockey game at Moravian on September 25.

Reinhart, who entered the game with a career total of one goal, opened the scoring in the 18th minute after running down a long ball over the top by junior Lance Dotzman. Reinhart settled the ball in the corner of the box and lofted a perfect shot to the upper-right corner over the outstretched arms of the goalie.

The same duo hooked up early in the second half when Dotzman won a ball on the endline, beat a defender and passed back to Reinhart for the short, soft tapin.

“Coach is always telling us not to hit the ball as hard as we can,” said Reinhart. “I got an earful about that after the game – I took five shots, and the two I didn’t hit hard went in.”




Heil finished with four saves, lowering his goals-against average to 0.41.




Muhlenberg (4-1), ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region for the second week in a row, hit hard from the start, dominating play despite leading by only a goal at halftime. Substituting freely, the Mules wore down the Greyhounds (3-2) in the unseasonable heat and humidity and doubled their previous best offensive output of the season.

“It’s great to finally put some balls in the net,” said Reinhart. “We were really patient in the attacking third today.

“We’ve really relied on our defense,” he added. “It’s good to know that even if we only have a 1-0 lead, we feel  comfortable.”

That stellar defense has now not allowed a goal in more than 400 minutes, but the shutout streak was almost broken less than four minutes after Reinhart’s second goal. Sophomore Ellison Heil came off his line to punch away a long Moravian pass, but the ball deflected to another Greyhound player. Heil recovered in time to make a spectacular punch save on a hard shot from close range.

Less than a minute after that, the Mules were on the attack again. Junior Oliver Katz beat a defender and crossed the ball across the box, 
and after it was headed by a Greyhound it it came out to Joey Roberts. The junior tapped it back to Dotzman, whose hard shot on the ground bounced off the left post and in, completing his four-point day. (corrected 9/12)

If assists were awarded in soccer like they are in ice hockey, junior goalie Danny Pinto would have scored a rare point on the final goal. With just two minutes left to play, his long boot following a save found striker Phil Rahling near the penalty area. Rahling beat a defender and his initial shot was saved, but the freshman put in the rebound to score a goal in his first career game.

Rahling was one of several Mules who made their varsity debuts in the game; in all 29 players saw action. And although the weather conditions made it impossible to avoid sweating, at least Muhlenberg did not have to sweat out another 1-0 win.

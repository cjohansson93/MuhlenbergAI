Community Update from President Harring
Monday, April 6, 2020

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
As we continue to navigate a new normal of remote learning and work, I want to make sure that we continue to keep you abreast of what is happening at the College. Each Monday I will send a community update to tell you about the ongoing changes and announcements. I am also inviting you to send me your questionsâpresquestions@muhlenberg.eduâand each week I will answer a handful of those questions via video. Normally, I will share the video on Thursdays, but in observance of the Passover and Easter holidays, I will send this first one with next weekâs message.
Last week we made the decision to cancel all study programs in foreign countries for the fall semester. There are just so many unknowns at this point that we consider it a risk to have our students enroll in programs that may not be available either through travel or in-country restrictions. We communicated with students scheduled to study abroad with the choices they could opt for, including the option to remain on campus for all of the 2020-21 academic year or to defer their study to the spring 2021 or fall 2021 semesters. Making a decision now about the fall study abroad was necessary to ensure that students would not be disadvantaged for course registration or housing for the fall semester. The students we have contacted have been appreciative of the decision and the options made available.
Muhlenberg also offers two off-campus domestic programs that will move ahead as scheduled. One of the two, a theatre program in New York City, has the ability to delay the start of the program should circumstances require.
We have also made the decision to move a number of other important programs to virtual or online experiences.

All face-to-face summer courses are either being cancelled or being made available online.
Our âThrough the Red Doorsâ event for admitted students as well as the âExplore Muhlenbergâ for high school sophomores and juniors are transitioning to sets of virtual events.
June Advising will be held at the scheduled time through virtual programming and  individual online outreach.

Perhaps the hardest decision was to postpone commencement. Yes, it was clear that we would not be able to hold graduation and related activities, but that didnât make it easy to let the seniors and their families know. We are determined, however, to hold an on-campus celebration at some point along with some virtual events to mark the end of our seniorsâ time with us. Seniors should expect to receive a survey to collect their feedback regarding these events. Details are being worked on now, but we plan to launch an online Honors Convocation experience in early- to mid-May and our commencement planning includes opportunities for a senior ball (or some sort of formal event), champagne brunch and the graduation ceremony. We will keep you informed as these plans come together.
There are two final decisions that I want to make you aware of, first, because so much of our daily lives has been turned upside down, we have moved our first-year student deposit date from May 1 to June 1. Community remains a primary concern for us here at Muhlenberg, and we hope this will allow students and their families the time they need to feel secure about their college choice.
The last bit of information I want to share is about the process for providing room and board credit refunds for students who left campus housing. For students who left before online instruction began, the credit refund is calculated for each student based on the amount of grants and scholarships received. The initial calculation begins with a refund based on unused meal plan swipes and dining dollars plus 50 percent of room charges and is modified by the amount of grants and scholarships, if any, received. 
Each student needs to be individually assessed, in particular students who stayed after the beginning of online instruction, and the refund statement will provide those details. Students who remain in campus housing through the end of the semester will not be eligible for a room and board refund. We hope to be able to process and send refunds at the end of April.
The process for providing room and board credit refunds for students who left study abroad programs early is more complex since each program has a different starting date, program length, and, if applicable, board fee. The credit refund will be calculated for each student based on the amount of grants and scholarships, if any, received and the length of time the student was abroad. Again, each student needs to be individually assessed and the refund statement will provide those details. We hope to be able to process room and board credits for study abroad programs and send refunds by the middle of May. Contact studyabroad@muhlenberg.edu with any questions.
Please remember to send me your questions to presquestions@muhlenberg.edu so I can answer them for our weekly Thursday video.
Stay safe and be healthy,Kathy HarringInterim President

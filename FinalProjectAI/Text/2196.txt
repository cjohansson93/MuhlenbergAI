Alumni Update
Emily Jeanne '14 â Theatre and Business Administration major, Active Dance Community member
Emily Jeanne Phillips '14 will play Jennyanydots in the new National Tour of Cats the Musical, opening Jan. 22, 2019. The production features new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, the Tony Award-winning choreographer of "Hamilton."
"Itâs been incredible working on the show," she says. "Jennyanydots is definitely a dream role of mine! Working with Andy during rehearsals was an inspiring experience. He has invented wonderful new ideas about the storytelling of 'Cats.' We also worked with Chrissy Cartwright, who assisted Gillian Lynne (the original choreographer). Itâs a beautiful blend of Gillianâs original choreography and some new and exciting 2019 movement from Andy. I feel so lucky just to be in the room with them.

"I canât wait for the show to open! Hoping to see some Berg friends in June when we play Philadelphia!"

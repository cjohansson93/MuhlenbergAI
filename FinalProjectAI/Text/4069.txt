men’s golf reigns in the rain



One of these days, warm weather will finally arrive for good. And perhaps the Muhlenberg mens golf team will have a tournament that day.

Until then, the Mules will have to settle for competing in the cold, rain and wind. But thats just fine with them if theyre winning tournaments.

Muhlenberg won the Moravian Spring Invitational by one stroke over Rutgers-Camden and Moravian for its third tournament title of the 2010-11 year. The Mules also won at Moravian and their own tournament in the fall, and at all three tournaments they had to deal with less-than-ideal conditions.

Today, just like every day, I told the guys to stay patient and keep grinding, said senior Zachary Oyer. When we get into this weather I feel we have a competitive advantage as we do not let it affect us. Im proud of how all our guys stayed together, grinding it out, knowing that each and every stroke counts.

Oyer was one of only seven golfers (out of 97) to break 80, playing at even par over the back nine to finish with a 6-over-par 78, good for fifth. He has shot in the 70s in all but one of his 11 rounds this year.

Freshman Chris DiMaio (right) tied for eighth with an 80, one stroke ahead of senior Eric Boskey. Senior Jordan Carpenter rounded out the Mules top four with an 82.

This is the second time in the last four years that Muhlenberg has won three tournaments.

Men’s Basketball Drops Shootout


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season in a wild 104-99 overtime shootout at Washington College.

The Mules (3-1, 0-1) forced the extra period when senior James Albano hit a tough three from the wing with hands in his face with 2.1 seconds left in regulation. The Shoremen scored the first six points of overtime, however, and came away with points on all but two of their overtime possessions.  

Junior Malique Killing scored 37 points, one off his career high, for his fourth career 30-point game. Killing scored all the points in a 10-2 run to open the second half that brought Muhlenberg back from a seven-point halftime deficit. He had 28 points five minutes into the second half but had to leave the game with an injury soon after and was not as explosive when he returned.

Sophomore Alec Stavetski added 25 points, shooting 4-of-5 from three-point range. Senior Austin Curry made all three of his shots from behind the arc and finished with 15 points.

The 203 combined points were the most in a Mule men’s basketball game that did not go into multiple overtimes since 1992.

Muhlenberg senior Nicki Cronin finished in the top half of the field at the NCAA Cross Country Championships in Hanover, Ind.

Cronin placed 135th out of 280 runners to post the third-best finish by a Mule women’s runner at the national meet. 


Of the 19 runners she finished behind at last week’s NCAA Mideast Regional, Cronin outraced six at the national meet, including two from national champion Johns Hopkins.

The Centennial Conference continued to show its strength in cross country, with Dickinson (15th) and Haverford (17th) joining Hopkins in the top 20. Only one other Division III conference placed three teams in the top 20.

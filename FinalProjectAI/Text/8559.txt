Anthony Dalton
Digital Cultures Technologist, Media & Communication / Office of Information Technology Adjunct Professor, Media & Communication anthonydalton@muhlenberg.edu Walson 108
Background
 B.S. Electronic Media, Kutztown University
Tonyâs dual role at the College gives him a unique perspective as both staff and faculty, support and instructor.  As a staff member, Tony manages, maintains and troubleshoots the MediaCom facilities and equipment; assists faculty, students and staff with resource use; and researches, proposes and implements innovations and improvements to those resources.  He is also a member of several groups and divisions on campus, including the Digital Learning Team, Instructional Technology and Digital Learning, Media Services and Healthy Youth Peer Education. As an instructor and adjunct professor, Tony instructs specialized workshops both in and out of the classroom for various media technologies.  He also is the instructor-of-record for media technology laboratory courses including Documentary Research and Video Production Labs, as well as the professor for the CUE-level course Digital Media Design Lab, a MediaCom seniors-only course designed completely around student-crafted mediamaking projects of various modalities and design. Through both his work as support staff and instructor, Tony studies and implements mediamaking theories, practices and technologies; the intersections of tech support and counselling psychology; digital storytelling as a tool for learning technology and encouraging self-expression; and the value and pitfalls of edutainment in higher education.

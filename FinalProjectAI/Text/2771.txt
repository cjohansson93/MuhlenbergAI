women’s basketball cruises in return






Naddaff scored a career-high eight points and led the Mules with six rebounds.






Junior Maiza Mock was one of three Muhlenberg non-starters to score eight points. The Mules reserves outscored the Arcadia bench, which
consisted of one player, by a 34-2 margin.



The objective in the first game after a long layoff is usually 
just to get back in the swing of things and prepare for the remainder of the season.
Rarely does a team, especially one that had been playing 

very well, unveil something new.

The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team, however, demonstrated the previously unseen dribbling ability of its post players in its first game in
more than two weeks, a 59-29 win against Arcadia in the first 
round of the Marymount Holiday Classic.

The Mules (7-1), ranked 22nd in both Division III polls, advance to the final to play Marymount, which beat Christopher Newport 82-63.

With just under six minutes remaining, sophomore center Sheila Cook grabbed a defensive rebound, dribbled the length of the court and made a layup.
She was fouled on the shot and made the free throw to complete the three-point play, after which she was replaced on the court by freshman Kathleen
Naddaff.

Just a few minutes later, it was Naddaff’s turn. After stealing the ball in the lane, she dribbled all the way down, and although she missed the
layup, she did get two points out of it on two free throws after an offensive rebound.

Those two plays got the Muhlenberg bench hopping in a game whose outcome was never in doubt, one that did allow the Mules to ease back into playing form.
Muhlenberg scored the first 13 points of the game (nine by senior Lauren Boyle, who finished with a game-high 14 points) and led 30-12 at halftime.
Arcadia (1-8) was down 45-14 midway through the second half before doubling its point total in the final 9:11. The 29 points were the fewest allowed by
the Mules since a 62-10 win against Bryn Mawr in 2001.

All 13 players who suited up for Muhlenberg played between 7 and 21 minutes, with all grabbing at least one rebound and all but three scoring at least one
point.

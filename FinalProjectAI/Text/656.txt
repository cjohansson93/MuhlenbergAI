Background
B.A., Luther College M.A., Northern Illinois University Ph.D., Purdue University
Thaddeus âTadâ Robinson joined Muhlenbergâs faculty in 2007. Robinsonâs academic and teaching interests fall into three main categories. The first category is Applied Epistemology and the Ethics of Information. Robinson has explored this interest through two different first-year seminars (âPersuasion, Manipulation, Deceptionâ and âIgnoranceâ) both of which focus on the relations between knowledge and power.  In addition, he served as the Director for the Center for Ethics programming series âInfluence and Informationâ in 2015-16, and directed the Dana Forum programming for the theme âTroubling Truthâ in 2017-8. Moreover, he is the author of the Open Textbook Arguments in Context: An Introduction to Critical Thinking. The text is available at https://open.muhlenberg.pub/arguments-in-context/. The second category is 17thand 18thcentury European philosophy with an emphasis on the philosophical system of Baruch Spinoza. Robinson regularly teaches a course in Modern Philosophy, and has taught senior seminars on Spinoza, as well as on systems of David Hume and Thomas Reid. Robinsonâs published work on Spinoza has appeared in the History of Philosophy Quarterly, Dialogue, and the Journal of Modern Philosophy. A third category of academic interest and teaching is the philosophy of religion from a global perspective. Robinson regularly teaches Philosophy of Religion, and has taught iterations of this course with faculty from Religion Studies. He is currently developing a course called âProblems of Evil,â and his publications in the philosophy of religion have appeared in Religious Studies and Sophia.

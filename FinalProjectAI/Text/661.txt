Philosophy / Political Thought
This interdisciplinary major focuses on American and Western European political philosophy, integrating appropriate political science and philosophy courses to permit a comprehensive examination of the Western state and its functions, justifications, and ideological foundations. Political theory courses are complemented by philosophy courses that examine the basic assumptions that underlie the concept of the state and society in Western history. The major is recommended to pre-law students and students interested in graduate study in this area. Students in this major may not take any courses in philosophy or political science on a pass/fail basis. To continue as a major the student must maintain a 2.000 grade point average in all courses attempted in the program. Majors may satisfy the writing intensive course requirement for the major in philosophy or political science.

SECOND STRAIGHT ROAD SHUTOUT FOR FIELD HOCKEY


The last time the Muhlenberg field hockey team traveled to Betty Prince Field, in 2007, Moravian tallied two late goals for a come-from-behind win.

The Mules defense ensured there would be no such comeback this time around.

Freshman Kristen Dornenburg made six saves  all in the second half  and two other Mule defenders made key defensive saves to ensure a 2-0 Muhlenberg victory on Wednesday.

In the first half we definitely worked as a team and were dominating the game, said senior Kristen Sabia. They came out strong in the second and really put the pressure on us, but we held our ground.

Senior Tara Cohn scored both goals for the Mules, with the first coming just under eight minutes into the game. Cohn picked up a loose ball on the right side and drove toward the net, where she lifted it past the Moravian goalkeeper for an early 1-0 lead.

Cohns second goal came off a penalty corner at the 52:54 mark. After her initial shot was blocked by a defender, she recovered to blast a second shot that not only went in the net but went through it. 

Tara finishes strong and always comes through when we need a goal, said Sabia. She just gets the job done.

Muhlenberg outshot Moravian 9-1 in the first half and kept the ball in the oppositions end most of the period, but the Greyhounds came out firing in the second.

Less than a minute into the half Moravian had a chance to tie the game, but sophomore Shelby Smith prevented the equalizer by blocking a shot on an open net.

Dornenburg turned away several more chances before Cohn made it 2-0, and sophomore Cait Teegarden made another crucial defensive save with 10 minutes to play.

With the win, Muhlenberg recorded back-to-back shutouts on the road for the first time since 1997. 

But despite their recent road success, the Mules are ready to try to keep their winning streak alive at home, where they haven't played since September 5.

Were excited for a home game; we havent been on our home field for a while, said Sabia. Were on the winning train right now and were planning to stay on it, she added.

Muhlenberg guest artist Doppelskope offers existential therapy session â with puppets 


The performance duo Doppelskope â Ora Fruchter and Muhlenberg alum Christopher Scheer '07 â brings its trademark show "An Existential Sing-Along" to the Muhlenberg College campus, Oct. 8 and 9.


	 Monday, October 7, 2013  11:18 AM

The Scheer describes Doppelskope as "an interactive and absurd neo-vaudeville theater group that makes wild, freewheeling new shows with puppetry, magic and clown in order to splatter your reality in an hour or less."
The duo employs whimsical performance techniques to explore obsession, anxiety and uncertainty. Scheer says that the interactive show features nightly raffles, giveaways, and choose-your-own-adventures, and that "after you leave 'An Existential Sing-Along' your perspective and/or marital status will never be the same again."
"These two slightly off-the-wall and uninhibited artists take the personalized human experience and condition to an entirely new level," writes Alan Vetter in the Taos (N.M.) News. "Singularly, Scheer and Fruchter's energy are downright enchanting, but together, they put forth what appears to be mind-numbing brilliance."
Muhlenberg College is a liberal arts college of more than 2,200 students in Allentown, Pa. The college offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in theater and dance.

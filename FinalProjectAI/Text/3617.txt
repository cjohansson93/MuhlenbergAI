mcdonough named to all-america team



Muhlenberg senior linebacker Patrick McDonough was named a second-team All-American by D3football.com.

Previously honored as Centennial Conference defensive player of the year, first-team All-CC and first-team All-South 




Region, McDonough led the Mules with 105 tackles in 10 games to become the first Muhlenberg player to average double digits in tackles per game since 1997. He led the CC and ranked among the national leaders in total tackles, adding 5½ tackles for loss, including 3 sacks, and a forced fumble. 

McDonough had some of his highest totals in tackles against the top teams on the Mule schedule. He recorded a high of 14 stops in the season opener against nationally ranked Delaware Valley and had 13 in a 30-27 win at defending CC champion Johns Hopkins. McDonough also made 13 stops in a win at Dickinson and a one-point loss at Moravian, earning the Bianco Award as Muhlenbergs MVP in the latter game. He had a game-high 9 tackles against Wesley in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

The McDonough-led Mule defense allowed fewer than 300 yards and 20 points per game for the 10th consecutive year. Muhlenberg finished the season 7-4 and earned a share of its record-tying ninth CC championship.

With McDonoughs selection, the Muhlenberg football program has had at least one player named to a postseason All-America team in nine of the last 12 years. McDonough is the first Mule picked for the first or second team by D3football.com since 2000.

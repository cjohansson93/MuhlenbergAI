A Festival of world premiere one-act plays, Muhlenbergâs âNew Voicesâ spotlights talent of emerging playwrights 


From the creative minds of three emerging playwrights comes Muhlenberg Collegeâs âNew Voices,â an evening of theater featuring three short plays. âNew Voicesâ runs Sept. 30 â Oct. 4 on the Studio Theatre stage.

“It has been very exciting to share the process that all the artists have been hard at work generating for months to prepare for rehearsals,” says Beth Schachter, the chair of Muhlenberg’s Department of Theatre and Dance and the evening’s artistic director. “Audience members will be getting more than their money’s worth by joining us for the three short plays.” 

In the provocative and timely “Death of a Sun,” by Claire Waggoner ’16, a mother and daughter watch the sun die out in the distant future. As they share the brief time they have left together, they examine what’s truly important and speculate about what might come next. Ariel Holman ’16 directs. 

“My Short Shitty Life” by Nikk Tetreault ’18, explores humanity through a series of absurd comedic vignettes. The play follows a large group of friends through loves lost and friendships regained. Sydney Watt ’18 directs. 

“Three Bedroom” by Lauren Waters ’15, follows a tumultuous night in the lives of four young women in their early twenties as they ride the roller coaster of New York City life and try to navigate their way to adulthood. Danielle Lichter ’16 directs. 

The New Voices Playwrights’ Festival is presented every other year as a part of the Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance Mainstage season. The festival provides up-and-coming young playwrights the opportunity to showcase their work in a collaborative and intimate environment. It also offers a rare opportunity for audiences to see the work of the next generation of emerging theater artists. 

“I think it is fantastic the department gives students the opportunity to showcase their work in the New Voices Festival,” Tetreault says. “The education and experience I’ve had so far with this project makes me want to continue to collaborate and develop new works at Muhlenberg and beyond.” 

Muhlenberg College is a liberal arts college of more than 2,200 students in Allentown, PA. The college offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in theater and dance.

Performances of “New Voices” are Sept. 30- Oct. 4: Wednesday through Friday, Sept. 30-Oct. 2, at 8 p.m.; Saturday, Oct. 3, at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sunday, Oct. 4 at 2 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for students.

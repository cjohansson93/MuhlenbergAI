Season Preview

volleyball gets fresh start


When the volleyball team gathered to take its team picture at the stone Muhlenberg College slab on the corner of campus, the area needed to be cleaned up a little. So some team members moved hoses and sprinklers, and others snipped branches off trees on both sides of the marker.

That's the type of season it's going to be for the Mules - everybody will have to chip in and be

willing to help out where needed in order for the team to achieve success.

Muhlenberg had its most successful season in eight years last fall, qualifying for the Centennial Conference playoffs, but lost a ton of experience, including a two-time all-conference hitter, a libero who was the program's all-time digs leader and the team's only setter.

That leaves the 2010 Mules with only five returning players to go along with four 
freshmen. Even the coach is new, as Alexa Keckler comes to Muhlenberg after averaging more than 19 wins in five seasons at CC rival Gettysburg.

"It's kind of good that way," said Caitlin Dombkowski, the lone senior on the team. "We're all starting new and starting fresh. It's a new experience for her and for us. Everyone's had to adapt to new teammates and a new coach, and we have a good positive attitude."

The new experience starts officially on Saturday, when Muhlenberg travels

to Massachusetts for a tournament at Gordon. The Mules return home to host the 13th Buttermaker Tournament next weekend.

"It's going to be a lot of changing rotations," said Dombkowski of the early tournaments. "People who used to play in the front row are going to be in the back row. We'll be trying to find the magic combination to see what fits best.

"It's tough because we have a young team, but we have a lot of potential."

Dombkowski has showed her potential during her career, finishing third on the team in blocks as a freshman and recording a career-high 34 kills last year. Junior Davi Gordon made the All-CC second team in 2008 before injuries limited her playing time last season. Junior Jackie Price, the team captain, has ranked in the top 10 in the CC in blocks each of the last two years.

Sophomore Jenn Seeba had an outstanding freshman year, leading the team in blocks and hitting percentage, and junior Brooke McQueen saw plenty of time in the back row last season.

The freshmen also will be needed to contribute, and as the team grows together, it hopes to have results that reflect its progress.

"It's definitely a different year," said Dombkowski. "Since the first day of preseason we've been improving every day. The good thing is we know what our weaknesses are, and we're working on turning them into strengths."

Field Hockey Wins Again; Men’s Golf Second; Women’s Tennis Not Blue

Field Hockey

Muhlenberg jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first 5:10 and held on to win its second straight game, 3-2 at Widener. 

Freshman Jillian Katz
scored her first career goal 4:39 into the game, and junior Nicki Notarianni made it 2-0 just 31 seconds later. 
Junior Tara Cohn scored the eventual
game-winning goal on a breakaway early in the second half.

Men’s Golf

For the second straight year, Muhlenberg finished second at the Susquehanna Fall Invitational, this time just
one stroke behind Franklin & Marshall.

The Mules shot a 304 and had four golfers in the 70s. Sophomore Zachary Oyer tied for second with a career-best round of 73.

Women’s Tennis

Muhlenberg began play at the ITA Southeast Regional, hosted by Mary Washington. Although all three Mules in the singles championship draw lost their first-round matches, 
the team experienced great success in the singles blue draw, going 4-0 in the first round. Sophomore Sara Sutker added a second-round win to advance to the Round of 16;
other second-round results were not available as of 11:00 Saturday night.

Two down, two to go.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team, playing its first four Centennial Conference matches of the season against the four other teams that qualified for the playoffs last year, passed the first half of the test with flying colors.

The Mules shut out regionally ranked Gettysburg, 3-0, to improve to 2-0 in the CC. The bar gets raised even further next week when the team has to travel to Dickinson (ranked third in the region and 23rd in Division III) and defending CC champion Johns Hopkins.

If Muhlenberg plays like it did against Gettysburg, it 




Tenenzapf is the third Mule this season to score at least two goals in a game.



should do well in those games. The Mules (6-2) put together an outstanding all-around effort against a Bullet squad that tied then-No. 3 Messiah and lost in the last minute of overtime to then-No. 3 York.

“We really play up to our competition,” said senior goalie Joseph Gogel. “In this stretch we have we’re really focusing in practice and following the scouting report.”

The scouting report for future Mule opponents will include reining in Steven Tenenzapf. The senior midfielder, who has set up scoring chances for his teammates throughout his career, proved he can finish too, netting the first two goals of the game.

In the 15th minute, sophomore Matthew Cecconi made a run out of the back on the right flank. When he got to the corner of the penalty box, he crossed the ball to Tenenzapf, who punched it past the goalie for a 1-0 lead.

The same combination struck again just 24 seconds into the second half. This time Cecconi’s cross from the corner of the field made it all the way through to Tenenzapf at the back post.

Freshman Cody Antonini put the icing on the cake with a great shot with 4:01 to play. After Tenenzapf intercepted a Gettysburg goal kick, he passed across the top of the box to Antonini, who lofted the ball into to the top corner on the opposite side for his third goal in four games.

“That shot goes in on me,” joked Gogel.

Not much has been going in on the first-year starter, who has not allowed a goal in 341 minutes. He needed to make only two saves against the Bullets (4-3-2, 1-1), thanks to a back four that is playing well together.

“I can’t say enough about those four guys and the job they’ve done,” said Gogel. “When they play like that it makes my job real easy. I just hang out back there.

“The way we’re playing defense, if we shoot the ball like we did tonight we’ll be tough to beat,” he added.

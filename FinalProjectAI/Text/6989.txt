Kline in the Clutch Delivers Softball to Two Wins

Kline had hits in eight straight at-bats and set a career high with five RBI against Elizabethtown; she drove in four runs in a game four times last year. She now 
ranks third in team history with 85 career RBI, just eight away from the school record. Kline is hitting .667 with nine RBI through four games this season.


With the game on the line, there’s no one the Muhlenberg softball team would rather have up than Kelly Kline.

The junior came up twice in such situations on the Mules’ second day in Florida, and she delivered both times, hitting a walkoff single and an extra-inning home run, giving Muhlenberg dramatic wins against Misericordia (9-8) and Elizabethtown (5-4). 

The two victories pushed the Mules’s record to 4-0, with the last three of the wins coming by one run in their final at-bat. Muhlenberg’s last 4-0 start was in its Centennial Conference championship season of 2011, but it hadn’t won three straight games by one run since 1999.

In the first game, the Mules rallied from a 6-1 deficit by scoring seven runs in the bottom of the fifth. Kline and junior Chelsea Benjamin each had two hits in the big inning, with Benjamin’s second hit driving in the final run, putting Muhlenberg ahead by two runs with two innings to play.

Misericordia came back, however, tying the score with a run in the sixth and one more in the seventh. After plating the tying run, the Cougars loaded the bases in the seventh, but senior Angie Sisco got a groundout to keep the score even.

The Mules had two outs and nobody on in the bottom of the inning when senior Devon Barber singled. After a walk to Benjamin, Kline singled to bring home Barber with the winning run and give Muhlenberg its second walkoff win in a row.

Kline drove in three runs in the first five innings of the second game, staking the Mules to a 3-0 lead, but Elizabethtown tied the score in the bottom of the fifth. Neither team scored in the sixth or seventh, sending the game to extra innings and international tiebreaker rules.

Benjamin was placed on second to start the eighth, and the Blue Jays elected to pitch to Kline even though she was 3-for-3 at the time and the players behind her in the order had only one hit all game. The strategy backfired, as Kline slammed a pitch over the fence in center for her school-record 16th career home run.

Elizabethtown’s first batter in the bottom of the inning also delivered, but she was thrown out trying to stretch her RBI single into a double on a relay from Benjamin at third after Alyssa Schell threw the ball in from left. The Blue Jays got one more runner on, but sophomore Kelsey Jones ended the game with an infield popout.

Rosen Tabbed Player of the Week


Junior Danielle Rosen was named the Centennial Conference player of the week after her remarkable day against Kean on Wednesday.

Rosen (right) set a new career high with nine points, tied for the third-most ever by a Mule in a game. Eight of those points  five goals and three assists  came in the first half, helping Muhlenberg tie a school record with 15 first-half goals. 

Rosen added an assist on the first goal of the second half, helping the Mules build a 19-1 lead en route to a 19-7 victory.







The Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team began the day with its community service, spending two hours at Winter Park Day Nursery reading to, coloring with and even running around and playing tag with the kids at the school.

Despite all that extra running, the Mules showed no signs of exhaustion in cruising to a 17-7 victory over Potsdam State, their 28th straight against non-conference opponents.

Muhlenberg (2-0) netted the first two goals of the game but found the Bears (0-1) difficult to shake in the early going. Potsdam hung tough, trailing only 3-2 before the Mules went off for six consecutive goals, including one from junior Christine Van Hise with 20.7 seconds left, to end the half.

They opened the second period the same way, scoring two goals 32 seconds apart to make it an 11-2 game. Potsdam finally ended the run with a goal, but Muhlenberg responded with five of the next six.

Junior Danielle Rosen had another fantastic game, tallying four goals and four assists. Senior Amanda McGovern also scored four goals, and Van Hise recorded her first career hat trick. 

Senior Danielle Scarrone had two goals and three assists, and sophomore Angela Napoletano tied her career high with two goals.

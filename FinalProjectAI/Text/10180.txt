On January 2, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a new effort aimed at expanding mental health services and reducing the stigma of mental healthcare. A day later, he convened the state's first Reach Out PA: Your Mental Health Matters roundtable discussion at Muhlenberg College. 
The roundtable was organized with the help of Pennsylvania Representative and Muhlenberg alum Mike Schlossberg '05, who has been at the forefront of efforts to address the issues surrounding mental healthcare in the state.

Muhlenberg College Director of Counseling Services Tim Silvestri participated in the Reach Out PA: Your Mental Health Matters roundtable.
Attendees included U.S. Congresswoman Susan Wild, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine and Muhlenberg Director of Counseling Services Tim Silvestri as well as other state and local legislators, public school administrators, city and state agency representatives and mental health service providers. 
Silvestri and Dr. Hasshan Batts, executive director of Promise Neighborhoods of the Lehigh Valley, both spoke of the need for diversity in the mental health caregiver community, so people in need can be comfortable seeking help.

Attendees included state and local legislators, academic administrators, city and state agency representatives and mental health service providers. 
âOur job must be to ensure that every single Pennsylvania resident who is searching for hope, for treatment, for love and for a better life can find it,â said Schlossberg. âAnd that is why we are here today.â

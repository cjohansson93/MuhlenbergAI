santagato named player of the week



Senior Eric Santagato of the Muhlenberg football team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Santagato completed 18 of 26 passes for 308 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Mules past Wilkes, 34-21. It was the third-best opening day passing performance in 
Centennial history.  Santagato’s scoring passes covered 14, 25 and 32 yards, the latter going to Phil Cresta with 6:48 left to put Muhlenberg ahead to stay. His
pass efficiency rating was a lofty 206.8 on the night.

Santagato’s 300-yard game was the 17th in Mule history and the first since 2000, when Michael McCabe threw for 355 against Hartwick. 

Santagato has earned the CC weekly award three times in his career. In the six games since winning it last year vs. Dickinson, Santagato has completed 99 of 153 passes (64.7 percent)
for 1,404 yards and 13 touchdowns with only one interception.

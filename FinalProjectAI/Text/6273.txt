Women’s Tennis, Men’s Lacrosse Lose


Some impressive performances helped the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team come close to handing Wilkes (13-0) its first loss, but the Colonels were able to hang on for a 5-4 win.

Freshman Jennifer Goldberg picked up with the biggest win of the day, knocking off a previously undefeated opponent at No. 3 singles, 6-4, 6-4. 

Sophomore Emily Szulman was equally strong at No. 2, dropping just one game in her 6-0, 6-1 victory.

Junior Amanda von Taube picked up the Mules’ (5-7) other singles win, also over a previously undefeated opponent, 6-4, 6-3 at No. 6. She also teamed with freshman Sharen Resnikoff for an 8-4 win at No. 3 doubles.

For two quarters, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team hung right with No. 9 Dickinson. But the Devils flexed their top-10 muscle in the second half to pick up a 15-6 win.

Junior Doug Rheiner notched the first goal of the game 6:08 in, and junior Jack Reilly and senior Corey Aferiat added tallies to pull the Mules (2-10, 0-6) even, 3-3, after one. After the Devils reeled off consecutive goals to start the second, Reilly added his second goal just 12 seconds before the break to make it 5-4 at the half.

But Dickinson (11-2, 5-1) outscored the Mules 10-2 after the break to pick up the win.

Aferiat added another tally in the fourth quarter to join Reilly with two goals, and senior Nick Rispoli  won a career-high 14 faceoffs and picked up a game-high eight ground balls.

A season of heartbreak got even more frustrating for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team at Dickinson. 

After using a late second-half rally to force overtime, the Mules took the lead twice in the extra session. But the Devils responded with a rally of their own and scored with 1:51 left in the sudden victory period for a 14-13 win.





Trailing by two with less than two minutes to play, senior Angela Napoletano scored with 1:13 left to make it a one-goal game.

After Muhlenberg (5-7, 1-7) won the ensuing draw control, freshman  Stephanie Umbach
 took advantage of a Dickinson yellow card by burying a free-position shot just 13 seconds later to pull even.

Napoletano helped the Mules carry that momentum over to the extra session when she won the opening draw and beat the Devil defense down the field before classmate Kelsey Elmer scored on a wide-open look just 10 seconds in.

Dickinson (7-8, 4-4) retied the game on a free-position shot, but once again the Mules, and Elmer, were quick to respond. With the Devils trying to get back on defense, Elmer scored off a feed from Umbach to make it 13-12 just 19 seconds later.  

Muhlenberg had a good look to end the game with a free-position shot 30 seconds into sudden victory, but it was saved, and Dickinson scored the game-winner on the ensuing possession.

Elmer (left) led the Mule attack with a career-high four goals, and Napoletano added three of her own. Umbach finished with a team-high five points (2 G, 3 A), four draw controls and three caused turnovers.

Sophomore Kaitlyn McCaffrey caused three turnovers, picked up four ground balls and dished out an assist, and classmate Michelle Certosimo added a goal and three assists to move into fifth place on the school single-season assist list.

Study Abroad
Muhlenberg Collegeâs Study Abroad Program offers our students a wide choice of experiences in countries including Italy, China, Tahiti, Australia, Ghana, France, and Costa Rica.  Music majors can take more traditional courses in Music at the University of Londonâs Goldsmiths College in England or explore traditional Irish music in our program at the University of Limerick in Ireland.
 

Seana Benz, Class of 2014
âMy experience abroad has allowed me not only to connect to history, but also to my own family. By visiting Stonehenge, I learned much more about the site and the great history behind its creation then I could learn in a classroom, as I could actually touch, or in some causes simply be near, the past. In addition, each member of my immediate family has visited the site, so I am now able to say that I participated as well, creating another bond for us to share.â

Spring 2021 Semester Plans



A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg community

Wednesday, November 11, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
We are nearing the end of the fall semester, a semester when our College has truly come together to support and care for one another. I am grateful to each of you for your commitment to our community as we adapted in response to the current global pandemic.
This fall, our planning groups evaluated options for the spring using our guiding principles as a framework. Our planning included assessments of the current testing availability, isolation/quarantine capacity, and community compliance with the public health measures implemented on campus. Our success this fall was due in part to the incredible effort of the students living on campus. Guidance from local and state public health officials and analysis from the spring planning groups informed decision-making. The health and safety of all members of our community continue to be a priority. I realize everyone has anxiously awaited this decision and I thank you for your patience.
We plan to welcome all students back to campus for the spring semester. Students who choose to live and study remotely will also have remote access to courses, student services, and co-curricular programming virtually as they have had in the fall. Classes will begin on February 8, 2021.
In the past few weeks, we have seen a surge in cases in our country. Our local and state officials have demonstrated that they have and will respond effectively. While we are currently experiencing a rise in cases, our decision-making for the spring reflects our confidence in critical aspects of our plan, such as additional testing availability and quarantine space, that will allow us to sustain a safe and healthy experience for our community in the upcoming semester. Nonetheless, we will continue to remain agile in response to changing conditions on campus and in our region. Our communityâs continued adherence to College COVID-19 policies will also be critical to this success.
We are still working through some of the details, but today I want to provide you with a framework of our spring plans. As plans become final, we will provide additional information via email and on our website.
Academic CalendarKey dates for the Spring 2021 semester:

Classes begin: February 8
No spring break
No classes: Good Friday, April 2
Honors Convocation: May 9
Classes end: May 14
Study days: May 15 - 16
Final exams: May 17 - 21
Commencement: May 24

Over the next two weeks, we will host several webinars for students and parents to provide updates. Each session will focus on a specific topic, such as health & safety, housing and dining, and academic and co-curricular life. Information about these webinars will be posted to the Spring 2021 Semester Guide web page launched on Monday, November 16.
As a reminder, the winter term, an extension of the fall semester, begins on January 4 and ends on January 29. Students who completed 4.5 or fewer courses this fall are able to enroll in a winter course as part of their fall semester tuition. There are still seats available in courses. Students interested in enrolling in a winter course should talk to their advisor and then add the course.
Academic ProgramMany courses will remain remote due to the need to accommodate students who choose not to return to campus and to de-densify available classroom space. Certain seminars, science labs and technique classes will be in-person or in hybrid formats. Students will be notified if there are any changes in course modality before the semester begins. Meetings between individual students and faculty should take place via Zoom, Google Meet, or in-person with strict adherence to campus health and safety measures.
Health & Safety MeasuresThe health and safety of all members of our community has been a priority in our response and decision-making to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We are each responsible for the health of everyone on campus and in our local community. Each personâstudent, professor and staff memberâis obligated to act in ways that prevent the spread of the virus. We know that the behavior of a few can jeopardize the experience for the rest of our community.
All students, faculty and staff are required to wear masks and adhere to social distancing and handwashing protocols. Wearing a mask, hand washing and maintaining social distance guidelines are the most effective ways to maintain health and safety. Individuals with medical conditions precluding them from wearing a mask will be offered alternative solutions.
Testing ProgramTesting capacity is significantly improved compared to this summer. With more students back on campus, we will scale-up testing and implement a four-pronged protocol. Pre-arrival testing will be completed for all returning students. We will also expand surveillance testing of the student population. Once in session for the spring, the student population will be divided in half, with each group being tested at least every other week. Students living off campus will be part of the testing program as well. That means that the entire student body on and near campus will be tested every two weeks at a minimum.
We continue to have rapid on-campus testing available for symptomatic students with results available in about an hour. The College will also provide testing for students, faculty and staff identified as close contacts of positive cases.
Isolation and QuarantineThe College has designated 2201 Chew Street and Taylor Hall for isolation and quarantine housing spaces on campus for individual students. In addition, depending on the situation, at times, students who share an apartment or suite may be asked to quarantine together in their private space as a âfamily unit.â In addition, the College is partnering with an off-campus hotel should additional quarantine space become necessary. In all cases, students with a meal plan in quarantine and isolation will have meals delivered to them in these spaces. If needed, faculty and staff who need to quarantine but cannot do so at home may be accommodated in the Collegeâs hotel spaces.
Housing, Dining and Campus LifeThe residential, dining and campus experience will be different for students who return to Muhlenberg in the spring. The College is preparing to launch a website on Monday, November 16, with full information about housing, dining, student life and academic support. This Spring 2021 Semester Guide will include critical policy information, guidelines for facility use and expectations for social life. Students and families should review all of this information in detail before deciding if living on campus is the best choice for them. From that website, students will be asked to complete the housing and dining registration form confirming their decision for the spring semester by December 1. 
Student Move-in and Campus Access RequirementsAll students must complete the following requirements prior to moving in or being granted access to campus (for those who live off campus). These will include:

Complete a home pre-arrival COVID test that the College will send to you and receive negative results (more information will be forthcoming about this process);
Complete all health forms and required immunizations, including the flu shot;
Participate in a required, virtual, pre-arrival Spring Orientation experience. This will take place the week of February 1 - 7. More information will be available about this experience in the coming weeks and students will sign up for a date and time to participate.

Student Housing Assignment InformationMost first-year students will be housed in Prosser, Walz and Brown in traditional doubles. Upperclass students will be housed in Martin Luther, East, the Village apartments, Robertson and South, Benfer, and MILE properties. Because Taylor and 2201 Chew Street will be used for quarantine and isolation housing, students originally scheduled to live there will be reassigned to new housing locations through the processes below based on their class year.
Seniors in Taylor and 2201 Chew Street will work with HRL on new housing selections. All seniors in other buildings will receive the assignments that they originally selected.
All sophomores and juniors will participate in a lottery, including MILE lottery, using the original lottery numbers assigned last spring. You must complete the housing and dining registration form by the deadline in order to participate in the lottery. The lottery process will take place the week of December 14.
First-year students can select a roommate in the housing form above and they will be assigned rooms in Prosser, Brown, Walz.
Students who were approved through the Special Housing Request Process will still have their accommodations met, but they may be in new room/building assignments.
Other important housing information can be found on the forthcoming website.
Co-Curricular Involvement and Social LifeMost campus events, such as lectures, presentations and meetings will continue to occur virtually. Virtual events and programming will be complemented by small social gatherings and programs on campus. Attendees at any kind of gathering are subject to social distancing, face mask/covering and other applicable policies. This includes capacity restrictions depending on the scheduled venue and if a gathering is taking place on or off campus.
DiningTo accommodate a larger number of students on campus and to provide a safe, healthy dining experience, the College has made changes to the meal plan options and has created additional dining venues across campus where dining swipes can be used. Students will have a combination of meal swipes that can be used to eat in person and to go. In addition, there will be the option to select a fully âto goâ meal plan. We are thrilled with the success of the BiteU application that was introduced this fall. It allows students to order meals ahead and schedule a pick up time. More information about new meal plans and dining venues will be available on the Spring Student website.
COVID-19 Policy and Student ConductStudents must strictly comply with all COVID policies and any restrictions, guidelines and instructions regarding the use and occupancy of all College buildings and facilities. Students must also comply with all health guidelines, including completing the daily symptom checker, complying with any requests for surveillance testing, and participating in contact tracing as necessary. Please understand these policies will be strictly enforced at all times and consequences for violating them will result in parental notification, the loss of housing privileges and/or campus access, along with other sanctions.
AthleticsThe Centennial Conference has not made a decision regarding the winter or spring athletic seasons. We will communicate this decision as soon as we are able.
I am grateful to everyone -- students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni and friends of the College -- for your support, input and patience. A distinctive quality and hallmark of the Muhlenberg community is the care and compassion we show to one another. Thank you for continuing to display this and for being a part of the Muhlenberg family.
Sincerely,
Kathleen E. Harring, Ph.D.President

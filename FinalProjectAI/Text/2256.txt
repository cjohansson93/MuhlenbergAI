Teaching Interests
My philosophy of education correlates with my colleaguesâ vision at Muhlenberg, I am passionate about teaching, I value close relationships with students and I am dedicated to the pedagogical and intellectual importance of research. I also identify with the Collegeâs mission when it states that âall members of our community are committed to educating the whole person through experiences within and beyond the classroom.â I consider critical thinking, cooperation and creativity in and outside the classroom to be the pillars of a liberal arts education. In this sense, my research agenda connects with my teaching approach, resulting in scholarly work directly inspired by class discussion or in the development of interdisciplinary projects where my research interests are shaped through my interaction with students.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research interests focus on literature, theater, history of political thought, performance theory and cultural studies. I am also currently interested in the areas of Anglo-Hispanism, trans-Atlantic studies, early modern diplomacy and travel writing. I believe we need to understand our past in order to make sense of our present. I also believe humanities and literature in particular can help us to go beyond the data, to deal with our motivations, desires, collective and personal goals that make us dream and work for a better future.

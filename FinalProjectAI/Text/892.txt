About Me: I joined the Muhlenberg team in 2013 and have become an admissions veteran in the office. I am a proud Muhlenberg alumnus ('10) and enjoy directing Rejoice! The Muhlenberg Gospel Choir. When I am not jamming out to Stevie Wonder, you might find me on a tennis court, watching NASCAR, or performing with an a cappella company (based in NJ).
Advice for Prospective Students: Maintain a strong academic performance and pay close attention to details. Be encouraged to reach out to us for guidance/help! We love working with prospective students, families, and counselors.
Favorite Food on Campus? My favorites would be the Farmhouse BLT from the General's Quarters or the blondies from the Noshery.

HOW THE MULES STOLE 2003


by Lindsay Weiss, A.T.C.







Every Mule down in Mule-ville, liked Muhlenberg a lot.
But the rest of the Centennial Conference. Did NOT!

The opposition hated the &#146Berg! Every week of the season.<BR>
Now please don&#146t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
<P>
It could be our softball team got too many hits.<BR>

Holidays!">
It could be that soccer just wouldn&#146t seem to quit.<BR>
But I think the most likely reason of all,<BR>
May have been playing the Mules was like hitting a brick wall.
<P>
But, whatever the reason, football or field hockey<BR>
They&#146d show up to play, a little less cocky.
<P>
For they knew every Mule in Mule-ville was tough<BR>
Cross Country, tennis and volleyball as if that wasn&#146t enough<BR>
Lacrosse, golf and basketball they say it with fear<BR>
2003 was exhausting, 2004 is almost here!
<P>
The opponents sit around, fingers nervously drumming<BR>
We must find some way to stop 2004 from coming.
<P>
For next year, they knew<BR>
Mule baseball and track<BR>
Will have success early, leading the pack.
<P>
And then! Oh, the cheers! Oh, the Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!<BR>
That&#146s one thing they hated. The Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
<P>
Then the Mules, young and old would rise from their seats<BR>
Clapping their hands, and stomping their feet.
<P>
They would cheer, Let&#146s Go Mules!  And &#146Berg is the Best!<BR>
The cheerleaders made sure that the crowd did not rest.
<P>
And then they&#146d do something rivals liked least of all!<BR>
Every Mule down in Mule-ville, the tall and the small<BR>
Would all come together, when opponents were idle<BR>
Chalk it up in the books, another Centennial Conference title!
<P>
They&#146d win! And they&#146d win! And they&#146d Win! Win! Win! Win!<BR>
And the more the rivals thought of this Muhlenberg win,<BR>
The more rivals thought, &#147We must stop this whole thing!&#148
<P>
&#147For several years we&#146ve put up with it now!&#148<BR>
&#147We MUST stop 2004 from coming!&#148<BR>
&#147But HOW?&#148
<P>
Then they got an idea!  An awful idea!  The opponents got a
wonderfully awful idea!
<P>
&#147We know just what to do!&#148 The opponents laughed to
themselves.<BR>
&#147We&#146ll just go to Allentown and be little elves.&#148<BR>
&#147Instead of bringing them luck, and things to make them better,
we&#146ll take all of their equipment.&#148<BR>
&#147The sooner the better!&#148
<P>
With all the equipment gone to try to change the rules<BR>
They realized it would take more than that to shut down the Mules.
<P>
And the opponents, with their feet not knowing where to go<BR>
Stood puzzling and puzzling: &#147How could it be so?&#148
<P>
<IMG SRC="grinch2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 ALT="Happy
Holidays!">

They won without javelins!<BR>
They won without bats!<BR>
They won without shoulder pads, racquets, hurdles, or hats!
<P>
And they puzzled for hours, till their puzzlers were sore.<BR>
Then the rivals thought of something they hadn&#146t before!<BR>
&#147Maybe winning,&#148 they thought, &#147takes a little bit more.&#148
<P>
And what happened then...?  Well ... in Mule-ville they say<BR>
That the Centennial Conference became stronger that day!
<P>
For they realized they musn&#146t continue to feel spite<BR>
For they realized perhaps they must play to a new height.<BR>
And they brought back the equipment and all of the tools<BR>
Then they<BR>
They themselves<BR>
Congratulated the Mules!

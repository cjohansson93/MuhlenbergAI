Lufei TengEmail: lufeiteng@muhlenberg.edu
Assistant Professor - Economics and FinanceB.S., Dalian Maritime University, ChinaM.A., Ph.D., Texas Tech University





Lufei Teng joined the Muhlenberg Faculty in 2017. She received her master degree in Finance and Ph.D. in Economics from Texas Tech University. Prior to coming to Muhlenberg, she has taught Macroeconomics, Money and Banking, Poverty and Inequality, Public Finance and international Finance for one year at Whittier College, California. Her current teaching focuses on Macroeconomics and Finance topics.
Her research is inspired by her interest in international economics and motivated by concerns about poverty and inequality. The overall goal of her research is to examine the effects of international finance on economic development, poverty and inequality reduction. Meanwhile she eagerly raises her studentsâ awareness of these two major worldwide concerns and inspires them to seek the solutions.
Lufei is from China. She enjoys reading, exploring new places and meeting new people. She believes traveling and reading are ways to know the world better and education makes the world a better place.

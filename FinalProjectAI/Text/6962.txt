Softball Completes Perfect Week with Sweep of Washington
 Saturday, March 30, 2013 - page 2







					 


The week in Muhlenberg softball was sponsored by the letter W and the number 100.

The Mules completed a 4-0 week in Centennial Conference play with a doubleheader sweep at Washington. And just like in Tuesday’s sweep of Swarthmore, a Muhlenberg player reached the century mark for her career in a major statistical category. 

Senior Devon Barber scored her 100th career run ahead of a two-run homer by junior Kelly Kline in the third inning of the first game, giving the Mules a 3-1 lead. They were never headed in winning that game, 7-2, and did not trail in taking the nightcap, 4-1.


The two wins put Muhlenberg (14-4, 5-1) at the top (tied with three others in the loss column) of the Centennial Conference standings in what looks like it will be a wide-open race. Just eight days into the league season, every team already has at least one loss.

The sweep came against a Washington (13-6, 3-3) team that received votes in the national Division III poll this week.

Barber, who doubled with one out in the third, is the third player in team history to score at least 100 runs. Many of them have come courtesy of Kline, who on Tuesday reached the 100-RBI mark for her career and immediately started working on her second hundred RBI. After grounding out in the first, Kline was perfect from the plate the rest of the day, going 5-for-5 with two walks.

Kline’s two-run homer was the 19th of her career. She later added doubles in the fifth and the seventh, the latter driving in a run, to move to within two of tying the school record for extra-base hits in a career (50).

Sophomore Alyssa Schell went 3-for-4, driving in Muhlenberg’s first run with a double. Freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski had two singles and drove in a run, and senior Jessica Costa also had an RBI single.

That was more than enough for sophomore Kelsey Jones, who pitched a three-hitter to improve to 8-1 on the season.

In the second game, the Mules took advantage of five Shorewomen errors to score four unearned runs. Kline stole home on the back end of a double steal in the first and drew a bases-loaded walk in the second, an inning in which Muhlenberg scored two runs on only one hit – a single by senior Elizabeth Sullivan (left) – to take a 3-1 lead.

Washington drew to within 3-2 with a run in the fourth but did not score the rest of the way thanks to the relief pitching of sophomore Heather Porrini, who tossed four strong innings to earn her first win of the season.

Costa led off the sixth with a triple, leading to an insurance run.

The last three times the Mules started off 5-1 in the CC – 2000, 2001 and 2009 – they went on to win the CC championship.

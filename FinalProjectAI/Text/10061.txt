Meghan Kita
Senior Writer/Managing Editor, Muhlenberg Magazinemeghankita@muhlenberg.edu484-664-4486
Meghan Kita helps the Office of Communications tell the stories of Muhlenberg students, faculty, staff and alumni across multiple platforms, including the website, Muhlenberg Magazine and print and social media. Her overarching goal is to share the narratives, experiences and achievements of the Muhlenberg College community. She also manages the process of creating Muhlenberg Magazine, which is published three times per year.
Before beginning her role at Muhlenberg, Kita spent nine years as a journalist, including six years at the national magazine Runnerâs World. There, she served as a print and online writer and editor, and she spent two years managing the brandâs social media platforms. She also earned the Guinness World Record for fastest marathon dressed as a fast food item (female) as part of a feature-writing assignment.
Kita graduated from Syracuse University with a dual degree in magazine journalism and English & textual studies. She lives in the beautiful West End of Allentown with her husband and kids.

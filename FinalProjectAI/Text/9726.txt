Last August, TikToker Emily Jacobsen posted an ode to Remy, the rat-chef star of the movie Ratatouille. In October, composer Daniel Mertzlufft set the song to orchestration, and his video went viral. Soon, #RatatouilleMusical was trending, and artists of all stripes were contributing songs, choreography and, in the case of Chris Routh â13 (who was a theatre major at Muhlenberg), miniature set designs. The project got the attention of Broadway producers, and on January 1, a streaming version of Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical went live. The performance (featuring stars like Tituss Burgess, Wayne Brady and Adam Lambert) raised money for The Actors Fund, and one of Routhâs sets opened the show. Hereâs how it all came about.
Iâve been recreating Broadway sets in a âshoebox theaterâ for my own enjoyment for years, but they were never very good. When the pandemic started, I moved homeâIâm a photographer and I wasnât getting much work. I watched all my favorite TV shows and then I thought, âWhat now?â
Iâve always thought that Wicked has one of the most amazing sets on Broadway. I thought recreating it might be too hard, but I had all the time in the world. I spent four weeks building the model by hand. I used a projector I got for Christmas years ago and a Lego robotics kit from elementary school to light and automate the set to move on its own. Even I was blown away by what I made. I wanted to share it, so I started a TikTok, @shoeboxmusicals.
On TikTok, you have to follow trends to be seen. One of the first trends I noticed was the #RatatouilleMusical trend, with Daniel Mertzlufftâs orchestration for a song about Remy. Iâd just finished my Wicked set and I was like, âIt would be funny if I used the sound and put this idea onto a stage.â I cut out a Remy, put him in my theater and did some projections. It only took 15 minutes, but that video blew up. I suddenly had thousands of followers.
Then, the #RatatouilleMusical trend got even bigger, so I made an actual set. In the movie, Remy controls [the human chef] Linguini from inside his hat by pulling his hair. I thought, âThe best pre-show curtain would be a silhouette of Linguiniâs hat.â The hat had to be transparent so I could project the shadow of Remy through the back.
I ended up making seven set pieces total. The one that went super viral was inspired by another TikTok creator, Gabbi Bolt, who wrote the song âTrash Is Our Treasure.â Patton Oswalt, who voiced Remy in the movie, shared the video of my set with her song on Twitter, and thatâs how everything got seen by Broadway and Disney.
From there, it was crazy. I got an email from Seaview, the Broadway production company that put [Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical] together, saying, âWe love your content. Weâre trying to put together a benefit for The Actors Fund with a team of Broadway talent.â I looked up the company and it all seemed legit. For the next few weeks, I was in contact with the director and the video designer to try to digitize my set models for a virtual space.
They used my pre-show set piece in the very beginning. I wanted it to move, but that didnât match their orchestration. I wish there had been more communication between the TikTok creators and the showâs creative team, but I understand the time pressure they had. Still, all the media coverage has been amazingâtalking to Playbill and Broadway World and The New York Timesâand the other TikTok creators are good friends now.
When I first moved to New York after graduating, I was trying to be an actor, but then, I lost touch with theatre. Now, from TikTok, I have a lot more friends involved in theatre and talking about theatre. Being able to work with a Broadway team and getting my quote-unquote first Broadway credit, it feels like Iâm doing it again. Itâs an amazing feeling.

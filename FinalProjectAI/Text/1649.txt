	 Thursday, October 20, 2005  01:59 PM

The exhibition highlights Wright’s most recent still-life work but includes as well a choice selection of figure-study paintings. An opening reception and gallery talk, will be held Wednesday, November 9, 4:30 – 6:00 p.m. in the Martin Art Gallery, Baker Center for the Arts. The exhibition and reception/gallery talk are open to the public and free of charge.
Wright’s oils, both still-lifes and figure studies, are intimate in scale but monumental in terms of capturing traditional, painterly use of light and shadow. He paints through direct observation and, as the Baroque masters did, intentionally uses light and shadow to add complexity to his compositions.
Currently, his still life subjects are rooted in our modern culture. Wright is “fascinated by the everyday, commonplace objects that have a peculiar, or specific, aspect to them”. He’s intrigued by the surfaces, textures, graphics, and colors that abound in various kinds of containers and packaging one sees almost daily-- red grapes in foam-green containers, plastic grocery bags, and takeout food containers. He considers them appealing and paint-able.
Chris Wright was born in Portland, Oregon in 1969 and grew up in both Oregon and Nevada. In 1995 he received his BFA in painting from the Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Oregon. He moved east to attend Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he received his MFA in painting in 1999. That same year he was included in a Chinese publication on contemporary American painters. He has exhibited at Hunter College, New York University, and Swiss Institute-Contemporary Art. He currently teaches painting at Pratt as a member of their Fine Arts Faculty, and resides in Brooklyn.
 Gallery hours are Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon – 9:00 p.m. For information, contact Kathryn Burke in the Martin Art Gallery office at 484.664.3467, Mondays through Fridays, 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.

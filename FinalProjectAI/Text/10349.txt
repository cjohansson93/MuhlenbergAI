Students rehearse at the JCC
A group of theatre & dance students are taking the skills theyâve learned at Muhlenberg out into the community. Savannah Hastings â22, Arianna Tilley â22 and Abigail Sherman â22 are the creative team behind Schoolhouse Rock Live! at the Allentown Jewish Community Centerâs (JCC) Stagemakers Theatre Arts Program. This is the JCCâs first full-scale production since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. 
âThe pandemic has stripped children of a portion of their youth,â says Hastings, who directs the production. âTo bring some of that feeling of community and play, in person, back to them is incredible.â  
The Stagemaker Program gives Allentown children, ages 4 to 14, a chance to perform onstage in a full-scale musical. It also provides a semester-long professional experience to graduating college theatre artists. This year's team includes Hastings, choreographer Tilley and musical director Sherman. Performances run April 28 and May 1; tickets and information are available at lvjcc.org/stagemakers.
Heather Lavin â08, program coordinator at the JCC, says that the children have been positively affected by the experience, which she attributes to the Muhlenberg teamâs work ethic and the departmentâs multidisciplinary approach to theater and dance. 
âThe holistic view they have gained from their studies has given them the ability to show the children a well-rounded approach to the performing arts,â Lavin says. âIt's really great to see them draw those connections across the other areas that they study and be able to create a well-rounded experience as these children learn about theatre for the first time.â
Hastings agrees that the Muhlenberg team has benefited alongside the cast of children. 
âI think it is wonderful to have the opportunity to expand outside of Muhlenbergâs campus,â Hastings says, âand use the skills that I have learned to help do something positive in the community.â
Schoolhouse Rock Live! is a musical based on ABCâs cartoon series of educational short films that ran Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1984.
âI used to watch it every day on VHS tapes, and I am still obsessed with the music,â Tilley says. âThose songs got me through [Advanced Placement] U.S. Government in high school.â
While Tilley feels a personal connection to the material, she says that what really drew her to the project was the chance to empower children as they learn to sing and dance.
âI just love working with kidsâwatching them get excited about dancing and being on stage,â Tilley says. âI remember that passion and drive as a kid. I have made it my personal goal to give everyone a spotlight to shine and steal the stage, and it has been a joy choreographing those moments and watching their faces light up.â 
Lavin says she enjoys the opportunity to connect with current and future Muhlenberg students. 
âI want students to know that itâs a place that they can come for employment and experience,â Lavin says. âI hope it kind of gets passed down from student to student.â 
As commencement in May approaches, Hastings is grateful for the opportunity to work in a professional environment. She says it has helped her to know what kind of leader she wants to be in the future. 
âI want to be a leader who listens, who is organized, and is dedicated to their community,â Hastings says. âWherever I go, I feel prepared and ready for the challenges that will be thrown my way.â

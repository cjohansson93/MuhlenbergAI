Six ECAC Qualifiers, One School Record at Home Track Meet
 Saturday, April 6, 2013 - page 2







					 


 

Many of the top perfomances by the Muhlenberg track and field teams in their outdoor home meet came from familiar names in familiar events – sophomore Tyler Bauer in the javelin, senior Samantha Mayden in the 800, junior Stephanie Carnevale in the hurdles.

And then there was senior Erica Bash, who made quite the splash – pun intended – in the steeplechase. In her first time ever competing in the event, Bash (right) finished second with an ECAC-qualifying time.

Bauer broke the school record in the javelin for the second straight week, throwing 201-6 to win by more than 17 feet. He qualified for the ECAC Championships and led a 1-4-7-8 Mule finish in the javelin.




Freshman Daniel Cano placed third in the discus, landing in 10th place on the Mules' all-time performance list.



Mayden was the only other Muhlenberg athlete to win an event, capturing the 800 meters in an ECAC-qualifying time. 

Carnevale placed second in the 100-meter hurdles with an ECAC-qualifying time of 15.23 that was just 0.06 off her personal best despite the breezy conditions. Junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski also qualified for ECACs in the high hurdles, improving her personal best by more than a half-second.

In the 100 meters, Carnevale finished fourth, jumping from 10th to third on the Mules’ all-time performance list.

The women’s 4x800 relay team added to the Mules’ ECAC qualifier list with its third-place performance.

The Muhlenberg Invitational was designated as the Matte Award contest for track and field. The Mule women defeated the Moravian women, 99-82, but the Greyhound men edged Muhlenberg by one point, 93-92. 

Muhlenberg has a 7½-5½ lead in the 2012-13 Matte standings and needs one more point to clinch the trophy. There are three contests remaining, in softball, men’s tennis and men‣s golf.

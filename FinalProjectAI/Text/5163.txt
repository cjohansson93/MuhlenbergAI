softball to play in ncaas at ramapo


The Muhlenberg softball team will head to Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., for the first rounds of the NCAA Division III Tournament.

The Mules (19-16) are seeded seventh and will play second-seeded 

William Paterson (32-7) in a first-round game scheduled for Thursday, May 7, at 4:00. The winner of that game goes to play the winner of the game between third-seeded Rowan (32-10) and sixth-seeded Farmingdale State (32-4) on Friday at 4:00, while the losers play Friday at noon in an elimination game.

No. 1 Messiah (35-4), No. 4 Moravian (34-9), No. 5 Eastern Connecticut (25-11) and No. 8 Staten Island (23-12) are in the top half of the bracket of the double-elimination tournament.

Muhlenberg and William Paterson both won their conference tournaments – Centennial Conference and New Jersey Athletic Conference, respectively – when the final day of play was rained out.

The Mules are making their eighth appearance in the NCAA Tournament. In their last trip, in 2003, they entered the NCAAs with a 14-19 record after winning the CC as the fourth seed and split four games at the regional, also held at Ramapo. Muhlenberg is 10-14 in its previous NCAA Tournament games, going 2-2 five times and 0-2 twice.

The Pioneers, ranked 22nd in Division III, are 17-20 in 10 previous NCAA berths. In their last appearance, in 2005, they won the East Regional to advance to the Division III finals, where they were eliminated in two games.

William Paterson holds a 10-4 series lead against Muhlenberg, although the two schools haven’t faced each other since 2001.

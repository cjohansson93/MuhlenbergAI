Something many people don’t know about me, but if they did they’d understand me better: I always look for the bright side to everything; I am an eternal optimist.

It’s where everyone congregates and my Mom has passed on her love and talent for creating great food to my sisters and me.

Favorite Place: My favorite place changes.  At the moment, my favorite place is Venice Beach, California, at 10:00AM, on Tuesday, August 18th, 2009.  The beach was quiet and perfect for walking.  Attached to place is time because places change with time and so do their meanings.

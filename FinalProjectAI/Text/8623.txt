Charlotte W. Newcombe Scholarship Program
Muhlenberg College is proud to announce an exceptional scholarship opportunity for adult learners enrolled in our Division of Continuing Studies. We have partnered with the Charlotte W. Newcombe Foundation to create a source of funding for adult students enrolled in their first Bachelor's degree program.  
The Newcombe Foundation provides scholarships in partnership with selected colleges and universities that welcome enrollment by mature adults and are committed to their success. 
Eligibility criteria for this scholarship include:

Students aged 25 or older who are pursuing their first bachelorâs degree and
Have completed at least half the requirements toward their intended degree with either full-time (3 or more course units)  or half-time enrollment (2-course units)
Are maintaining a GPA of 2.5 or higher
Have unmet financial need as demonstrated by completing the FAFSA

Applicants are encouraged to describe other life circumstances or personal challenges that may have impacted their path to achieving their Bachelorâs degree.
Applications will be reviewed by the Scholarship Committee.  For the 2021/2022 Academic Year,  each of the six (6) Newcombe Scholars who are selected will receive a $5,000 Scholarship.
To apply for a Newcombe Scholarship, please complete the application.

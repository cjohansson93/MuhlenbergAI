Field Hockey, Women's Soccer Seasons End in ECAC Tournament
 Wednesday, November 12, 2014 - page 2







					 



Outstanding seasons for the Muhlenberg field hockey and women’s soccer teams came to an end on their home fields
in ECAC Tournament first-round games.

Field hockey lost a heartbreaker to Stevenson, 1-0 in overtime, in an ECAC Mid-Atlantic game, while women’s
soccer fell to Wilkes, 3-0, in the ECAC South Tournament.


Field hockey team put up a tough fight and played terrific defense in its game. 
The lone goal came off a scramble in front of the cage 3:13 into the extra period.

It looked like the Mustangs (13-7) were going to break through late in the second half, 
but Muhlenberg made play after play to keep things scoreless at the end of regulation. 
Senior goalie Sierra Lenker made a diving save on a stroke in the 65th minute, 
and sophomore Emily Boyle (left) defused back-to-back penalty corner opportunities 
as the second half came to a close.

Muhlenberg (12-6) dominated stretches of each half and had the majority of the chances throughout. The Mules
had a goal disallowed in the first half.


The loss ends the impressive careers of nine Mules: Lauren Jordan, 
Christine Germaske, Meghan Gill, Samantha Swire, 
Allie Califano, Heather Porrini, Kayleigh Thies,
Ray Gallagher and Lenker.  

Muhlenberg’s 12 wins this season are its most since 2007.

Women’s soccer gave up an early goal and spent most of the night trying to catch up in its game.

The Colonels (12-8) scored off a failed clear in the third minute and took advantage of another miscue in the
back to make it 2-0 late in the half. 

Keeping in mind a game against DeSales last month in which they overcame a two-goal deficit to tie, the Mules
(11-7-2) put pressure on Wilkes at the start of the second half but could not find the mark. Wilkes put the
game away by scoring off a throw with 21:50 left.

Seniors Colleen Touhey, Krissy Fioretti and Audrey Zamichow
played in their final game for the Mules, who reached double digits in wins for the first time in five years.

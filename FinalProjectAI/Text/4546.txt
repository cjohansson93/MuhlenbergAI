Torphy Named Runner of the Week




Senior Bobby Torphy of the Muhlenberg mens cross country team was named runner of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Torphy ran 26:46.07 to finish third out of 277 runners and lead Muhlenberg to a second-place finish at the DeSales Invitational on Saturday. The Mules trailed only Division II Kutztown, and Torphy was the second Division III runner across the line.

The third-place finish tied a career best for Torphy. He also came in third at the 2008 Mule/Falcon Classic.

The Muhlenberg men are ranked ninth in the Mideast Region again this week.

The womens team has not broken into the regional rankings yet, but finished ahead of a pair of regionally ranked opponents by wide margins at DeSales. The Mules team score of 170 easily eclipsed the 209 for Lebanon Valley (ninth in the Mideast) and the 287 for Rowan (seventh in the Atlantic).

The Muhlenberg mens soccer team moved up two spots in both of the Division III polls this week.

The Mules, one of 10 undefeated teams in Division III, are ranked 17th by D3soccer.com and 19th by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. 

The rankings are the highest in the respective polls this season for Muhlenberg, and the No. 17 ranking is the highest for Muhlenberg this late in the season since 1997.

Of the Mules four ties, three are against teams that appear in the D3soccer.com poll: Johns Hopkins is ranked 15th, and Dickinson and New York University each received two votes.

Muhlenberg has tied a school record for longest unbeaten streak from the start of a season (11 games, set by the 1995 national semifinal team) and is undefeated in its last 18 regular-season contests.

The Mules face a non-conference challenge at home tomorrow night in 10-1-1 Drew, which is ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the NSCAA.

Women's Lacrosse Scores Early And Often To Beat Bryn Mawr

Senior Maggie Hare made the first start of her career against the Owls and helped the Mule defense allow its fewest goals in a conference game since 1997.




While the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse game with Bryn Mawr was already well in hand, the Mule crowd reached a crescendo when senior Becky Ritter got the ball in the offense end in the closing minutes.

And after she pulled the ball out on a pair of free-position attempts, screams of “Shoot Becky, shoot,” came from the stands.

When she got her third attempt at a free shot, Ritter took advantage, scoring the first of her two goals in the final 1:41 to help the Mules pick up their first Centennial Conference win of the season, 17-2 over Bryn Mawr (2-10, 0-8).

While she said she didn’t hear the screams, which came from her family, Ritter said she was anxious to get a chance to take a nice step back in time. After playing on attack in high school, she switched to defense when she got to Muhlenberg, so she admitted there was a slight feeling of pressure when she got the ball in the offensive zone.




Ritter’s two goals equaled her career total entering the game.




“When I got here, I realized I didn’t really have the stick skills to play offense, but I played hard, which was good for defense,” said Ritter, who hadn’t attempted a shot all season. “I don’t get to shoot much, so I was a little nervous when I went up on offense. It was a cool feeling to get to score some goals again.”

Coming off three straight one-goal losses, the Mules (5-6, 1-6) took their frustrations out early on the Owls, scoring seven times in the first 5:08 and recording the first 11 goals of the game.

Both senior Angela Napoletano (4 G) and sophomore Michelle Certosimo (3 G, 1 A) recorded first-half hat tricks, and the Mules led 12-1 at the break. Napoletano added three assists to set a new career high with seven points, giving her an even 110 for her career.

Senior Kelsey Elmer (1 G, 2 A) and juniors Alex Bellini (2 G, 1 A) and Molly Davin (1 G, 2 A) collected three points apiece, and junior Tiffany Kreider split her eight saves evenly between the two halves.

Junior Jill Freda scored her first goal as a Mule, while freshman Sarah McTamany and sophomore Meg Reilly scored their second and third career goals, respectively.

The win was a welcomed change for the Mules, who have experienced plenty of heartbreak this season. But now that they’re back on the winning track, Ritter said the squad is focused on staying there for the rest of the year.

“We’ve been a little bit unlucky the past few games. We’ve been right there, but they haven’t gone the way we’ve wanted,” Ritter said. “It feels so good to finally get a win again. Now our goal as seniors is to win our last two games so we can go out with a winning season.”

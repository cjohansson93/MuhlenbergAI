two earn cc honors


Two Muhlenberg athletes, senior Mickey Norton of the men’s lacrosse team and junior Christian Conti of the baseball team, earned player-of-the-week 
honors in their respective sports from the Centennial Conference.
 
Norton (above left) tied a school record with five assists in a 9-8
triple-overtime win at Franklin & Marshall. One of Norton’s helpers came on the 
game-winning goal by classmate Kyle Farris 67 seconds into the third overtime. Norton, who ranks fourth in the CC in assists per game, also became the

program’s all-time scoring leader, as his five points pushed his career total to 110 on 42 goals and a school-record 68 assists. 

The win was significant for the Mules on several fronts: It was their first ever at F&M, which received votes in the national Division III poll, it gave them 
back-to-back CC wins for the first time in their history, and it kept them alive for a CC playoff berth.

Conti (below left), who earned the honor for the second time this
season,
hit .500 with seven runs scored, three triples, two home runs and 10 RBI in a 
2-1 week for the Mules that included a doubleheader split with nationally ranked Johns Hopkins. He had a 1.500 slugging percentage for the week. 
Conti set the school record for triples in a season (nine), tied the school record for RBI in a season (41) and became the first Muhlenberg player in 20 years to hit seven homers in a season.

Conti is putting together one of the best offensive seasons in Muhlenberg history. Through Sunday’s games, he led the CC in RBI, 
runs scored (37), triples, home runs, total bases (76), walks (19) and slugging percentage (.938) and was second in on-base percentage (.533) and 10th with a .420 batting average.

Conti added to his incredible totals by hitting yet another home run in Monday’s makeup game at Dickinson, but when he led off the fourth with a solo shot to dead center, 
the Mules already trailed 8-0, and they went on to lose, 12-3. The round-tripper was Conti’s record-tying 20th extra-base hit.

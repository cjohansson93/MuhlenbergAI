Volleyball streaks past Owls 




McQueen finished with 11 digs against the Owls.


After completing a three-set sweep of visiting Bryn Mawr, the Muhlenberg volleyball team disappeared into the locker room.

Moments later, the Mules stormed back onto the court, circled around coach Alexa Keckler and began screaming. Muhlenbergs first-year head coach  who previously spent five seasons at Gettysburg  had just earned her 100th career win thanks to the Mules' 25-20, 25-21, 25-16 win over the Owls.

I wish we had some Gatorade to dump on her, junior Brooke McQueen joked. We were so glad we could get this for her and Im just proud of our team for getting it together and pulling through.

It just feels so good to know all the work weve put in throughout the year is finally starting to pay off.

The Mules, who earned their first two-match winning streak of the season, appeared in sync from the very beginning. They used a pair of service runs from Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare to rush out to a 22-13 lead before holding off a Bryn Mawr rally to take the set.

Ojo-Ohikuare kept the Owls (9-10, 3-4) off-balance with her serve and finished the set with two aces as she served for 10 of Muhlenbergs 25 points.




Ojo-Ohikuare leads the team with 22 aces.



The second set was a back-and-forth affair that saw the two teams tied at six different points of the set. Bryn Mawr took the lead at 21-20, but then the Mules (4-19, 1-6) rolled off five-straight points, including a pair of kills from Jenn Seeba and one from Davi Gordon, to win the set.
 
We came out here with a lot of energy and were aggressive, junior Jackie Price said. So even when we had that kind of rough stretch in the second game, we didnt let them get to us and stayed positive and aggressive to push through it to get the win.

Looking to avoid any more close-set drama, the Mules came out hot in the third set. They jumped out to leads of 14-6 and 20-11, before finally finishing off the Owls, 25-16, for their first conference win.

Gordon and Ojo-Ohikuare finished with seven kills apiece to lead the Mules, while Seeba added six. Freshman Morgan Duggan dished out 19 assists and added three aces, while fellow freshman Erica Wenzel finished with a team-high 13 digs.

Coupled with Saturdays three-set sweep of Montclair State, the Mules have won their past six sets, their longest streak of the season. And according to Price, thats validation for the time and effort the team has put in this season. 

 Weve improved so much since the beginning of the year, Price said. Even though our record doesnt show it, everyone is so much more comfortable on the floor and theres a lot more communication. Everyone knows what theyre doing and its fun.

Im just proud of everyone because weve been working so hard in practice and its finally starting to show out on the court.

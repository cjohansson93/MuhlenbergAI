Russian Studies - Alumni Updates


Did you participate in Russian Studies at Muhlenberg? If so, tell us what you've been up to!

Are you currently employed in the work force or continuing your education? If so, where?
Do you enjoy what you're doing?
What are your plans for the future?
Have you ever been able to use your knowledge of Russian language/culture?
Do you find that the understanding of cultural differences that you've developed as a Russian major/minor plays a role in your life?
Is there anything you'd like to share about your personal life?
Are you ever on campus for Homecoming or Alumni in the Classroom? Would you like to meet current students? Talk in class? Talk at a Russian Club meeting?

Send an email to Dr. Luba Iskold or to our Presidential Assistant. We'd love to hear from you!

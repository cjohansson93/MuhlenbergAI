Education
Ph.D. Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston,IL.

Thesis: Markov Partitions and the Expanding Factor for Pseudo-Anosov Homeomorphisms.
Thesis Advisor: Professor John Franks.
Research Area: Dynamical Systems.

M.A. Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.
B.A. Mathematics, Summa cum Laude, St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN.

While at St. Olaf, I participated in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics Program. Through this program, mathematics majors in their junior/senior years spend one semester in Budapest studying under the tutelage of eminent Hungarian scholar-teachers. Courses are taught in English.

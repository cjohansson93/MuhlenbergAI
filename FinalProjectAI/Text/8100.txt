Teaching Interests
Organic chemistry is at the core of my teaching interests. In all of my courses, I describe the medicinal and biological applications of organic chemistry as well as real-world examples. In addition, I am fascinated by the pharmaceutical industry and the drug discovery and development process. Some of my recently developed courses (medicinal chemistry and pharma: a scientific approach) cover these topics in detail. I have an interest in further contributing to the integrative learning curriculum, either in the form of a linked course or a standalone interdisciplinary course.  
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research interests lie at the interface of chemistry and biology. Broadly, I am interested in improving the pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical efficacy of known drugs by altering their physicochemical properties. It is a common misconception that drugs only fail because of weak receptor binding or high toxicity. Drugs can also fail to reach the market because of poor PK properties. Hence, there is a large and accessible arsenal of viable drug leads just waiting to be improved upon.  
Drugs intended to treat CNS disorders such as Alzheimerâs disease (AD) often suffer from low clinical efficacy because they are blocked entrance to the brain by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  My current research focuses on improving the BBB permeability of known drugs by linking them to high-permeability shuttles. My students use solid-phase organic synthesis, a method that involves a reagent or product attached to a polymer bead. This is used to synthesize peptidomimetics, column chromatography for purification and thin layer chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for product characterization. Finally, an in-vitro membrane permeability assay is used to assess the BBB permeability of these novel compounds.

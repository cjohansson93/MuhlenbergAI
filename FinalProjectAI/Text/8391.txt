Additional Resources for Graduate Study in The United Kingdom
Many additional sources are available for students seeking information on opportunities for study in the U.K. The websites may be especially helpful for potential applicants for the British Marshall, Davies-Jackson, Gates Cambridge and Rhodes awards.
The British Council USA website contains a database of graduate programs, including information on the application process, the differences between higher education systems in the U.S. and the U.K., lists of available scholarships and funding sources. Website: http://www.studyintheUK.org. The British Council USA office also responds to email sent to info@us.britishcouncil.org.
Quality of teaching in U.K. universities is assessed by the Quality Assurance Agency. The QAA operates a website which can be accessed through the website of the Higher Education Funding Council of England. Website: http://www.hefce.ac.uk.
The Research Assessment Exercise provides evaluations of quality of curriculum design, content and organization, student achievement and learning resources. Website: http://www.rae.ac.uk.
The British Marshall website has useful links. Website: http://www.marshallscholarship.org/links.html.
University rankings are published in several U.K. newspapers and are available online. Two online sources are: The Times Good University Guide – http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/ and the Guardian – http://www.EducationGuardian.co.uk/universityguide.

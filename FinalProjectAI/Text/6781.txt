Javelin Throwers Dominate at CC Track Meet; Women Come in Third
 Sunday, May 5, 2013

“Got to be runnin’ cold upside down his head, you know?”




Bauer's long throw gave the Mules a league-high seven gold medals in the javelin in the 20 years of the Centennial Conference.



The Muhlenberg men’s track and field team wasn’t speaking jive (like the character from the movie Airplane quoted above) 
at the Centennial Conference Outdoor Championships, it was speaking jav. The Mules put on a historic display of throwing prowess, placing four in the
top five to account for more than a third of their team points.

The men finished in fifth place, improving their indoor finish by one place and landing in the top five for the 12th time in 13 seasons. The women nearly duplicated
their indoor finish, when they tied Haverford for second place. This time they came in third, a half-point behind the Fords and a big improvement after two straight 
seventh-place finishes.

Leading the charge of javelin throwers was sophomore Tyler Bauer, who won his second straight gold medal with a school- and meet-record 
throw of 209 feet, 3 inches. Bauer won by more than 24 feet (over freshman teammate Jordan Rosenthal) and broke the previous meet record
by more than 10 feet. He was named Most Outstanding Performer for field events, becoming the first Mule since 2005 to earn that honor.




Mayden placed in the 1,500 at the CC meet for the third straight year. She was eighth in 2011 and fifth last year.



Behind Bauer and Rosenthal, senior Ryan Hellings and junior Andy Wolfe came in fourth and fifth, respectively. It was the
first team the men’s team placed four athletes in one event since it went 1-4-5-7 in the 200 meters in 2010. Three in the top four? That hadn’t
happened since Muhlenberg shot putters finished second, third and fourth indoors in 2004.

Bauer and Rosenthal were the first pair of Mules on the men’s team to win gold and silver since 2002, when the feat was accomplished in both the high jump
and the javelin.

Hellings (in the pole vault Friday night) and Bauer were the only Muhlenberg athletes to win gold at the meet. Junior Andrew Onimus brought home
two bronzes, one in the 400 meters and the other in the 4x400 relay, where he teamed up with three other Mules who also play football – junior Darnell Davis, 
sophomore Keenan Mease and senior Isaiah Vaughn. Onimus, Davis and Vaughn also ran on the fourth-place 4x100 relay; both relay teams posted 
ECAC-qualifying times. Vaughn placed in four events total, coming in fifth in the 100 and sixth in the 200.

The women combined for 10 ECAC-qualifying performances, five silver medals and two school records. The 4x800 relay broke a school record on Saturday, and on the
last day of the meet junior Stephanie Carnevale put her name in the record book for the fourth time this year, erasing an eight-year-old mark in the
100-meter hurdles while winning a silver. Carnevale also placed fourth in the 200 and sixth in the 100.

Senior Samantha Mayden qualified for ECACs in two events on the last day, finishing second in the 5,000 and fourth in the 1,500. Mayden won two silvers 
in the meet to go along with the two she won indoors. She finished her CC career with six silver medals but no golds.

Senior Tara Keegan picked up the first silver medal of her career, coming in second in the javelin. She also ran on the 4x100 relay team that finished
fifth and crossed the line sixth in the 400 hurdles. During her career, the versatile Keegan earned a total of 18 places in the long jump, triple jump, javelin, 400 hurdles and running in
relays in distances ranging from 100 meters to 400 meters.

Sophomore Kirsten Kuchera also placed in multiple events on the last day, anchoring the 4x100 and 4x400 relays and finishing sixth in the 200.

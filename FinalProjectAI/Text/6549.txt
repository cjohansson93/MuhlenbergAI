Freshman Che Chengsupanimit of the Muhlenberg wrestling team recorded the first wins of his career, going 2-2 at the Ursinus Fall Brawl.

Both of the wins for Chengsupanimit (left) came against opponents from Liberty. He pinned the first before losing my major decision to a wrestler
from The College of New Jersey in the second round. In the consolation bracket, Chengsupanimit posted a 6-2 decision before getting pinned by a Gettysburg
opponent.

Chengsupanimit was one of two Mules who competed in the tournament.

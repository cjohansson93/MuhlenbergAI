resurfacing project heads to finish



After a series of unexpected delays, the turf replacement project at Scotty Wood Stadium took a huge leap forward on Tuesday when a crew began to put down the e-layer. Composed of rubber granules and polyurethane, the 19-millimeter e-layer is the "shock absorber" for the field; the turf is installed directly on top of it. 
 
By the end of the day Wednesday, more than half the field had been “e-layered.”

The field is scheduled to be completed in time for the September 5 field hockey game vs. Hartwick. 

If it is, the only athletic competition displaced by the construction delay will be the field hockey tournament scheduled for next Friday and Saturday. Those games will be played at Whitehall High School.

Men’s lax grabs first season victory

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse 



With his four goals, Farris moved into fourth on the Mules’ all-time list with 69 in his career.



team picked up its first victory on the young season, defeating hosting Greensboro, 12-6. 
However, the first quarter of the game didn’t indicate the success was going to come in a categorical fashion. Senior Tim Martin had just opened the scoring for Muhlenberg three minutes into the game, when Greensboro’s Brandon Savage tied the score. Nick Patrone gave the hosts a 2-1 cushion going into the second quarter. 
But the Mules had already won here a year ago and were confident in their superiority.
“We had to get back our composure, refocus our attention and play with intensity,” said junior Nick Fletcher. “We knew we were a better team and just needed to get into groove.” 
And so the Mules did. Four unanswered Muhlenberg goals followed, scored by Ivan Asplundh, Kyle Farris (2) and Martin in the second period. 
Farris’ second goal came right with the final whistle for the first half, shaping up a 5-2 lead for the Mules.
Muhlenberg outscored the Pride, 7-4, in the second half thanks to goals by Mike Brown, Farris (2), Andrew Lolley, Tim Dwyre, Brent Siebold and Fletcher. 
“Defensively, we did extremely well, holding Greensboro to only six goals,” Fletcher said. “However, in offense we need to work a little more and fix the small things. Then we will be able to turn the games into more dominant wins.”
Farris was Muhlenberg’s top goalscorer in the game with four, while Martin finished with two goals and nine faceoffs won. 
John DeLuca and Dwyre had team-leading four ground balls for the Mules, who outshot their opponents 37-32.

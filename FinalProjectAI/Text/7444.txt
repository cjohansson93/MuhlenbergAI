Men's Golf Third at Ursinus; Baseball Rally Falls Short
 Tuesday, April 22, 2014 - page 2







					 




Freshman John Froberg matched a career low with a 77 to lead the Muhlenberg men’s golf team to a third-place finish in the Ursinus Spring Invitational.

Froberg, who finished tied for fifth in a field of 44 golfers, was one of three Mules to sign for sub-80 scores, with sophomore Jonathan Graulcich (left) and senior Christopher Lucarelli each tying for ninth with a 79. Froberg and Lucarelli both carded a pair of birdies.

Muhlenberg, with a team score of 318, was just two strokes behind Alvernia and six off the pace set by team champion Albright. The Mules finished ahead of CC opponents Swarthmore, Dickinson and Ursinus in their penultimate regular-season match before this weekend’s conference championships.

Freshman David Barkley shot an 83 for the Mules, including two birdies. Fellow rookie Joseph McNaney signed for an 86, five strokes lower than his previous career best.

Baseball couldn’t take advantage of an improbable second chance and fell out of second in the Centennial Conference standings with a 7-6 setback to visiting Dickinson.

The Mules nearly rallied all the way back from a four-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth, helped along by a dropped popup. But a deep fly out to right ended Muhlenberg’s comeback bid with the tying run on second. 

Muhlenberg’s third straight loss puts it in a more precarious position heading into its final three games. After entering Tuesday’s contest tied for second place with Haverford, the Mules (15-16, 8-7) are now a game back of the Fords and level with McDaniel in third as a host of schools battle for the three remaining playoff spots behind first-place Gettysburg. Johns Hopkins (7-7 CC) is right behind in fifth, with Muhlenberg set to host the Blue Jays Saturday for a critical doubleheader to close out the regular season. Four other squads, including Dickinson, are within two games of third place.

Trailing 7-3 going into their last at-bat, the Mules made things tense for the Red Devils (20-11, 6-8), loading the bases with one out. Freshman John Icaza kept it moving with an RBI single to center, and junior Jimmy Cody grounded into a run-scoring fielder’s choice to cut the deficit to two. 

The game looked to be all but over when senior John Scuderi hit a towering popup on the infield, but the Dickinson second baseman muffed the sure out, allowing classmate Brett Rosen to come home and make it 7-6.

Icaza led the way offensively with three hits, including a booming double to lead off the bottom of the sixth. Junior Nick Plinio had an RBI double in the seventh and finished with two hits.

Junior David Anderson was a hard-luck loser on the mound. Anderson threw eight strong innings, surrendering only two earned runs four days after spinning eight shutout frames in a victory over Swarthmore. The right-hander struck out three without a walk.

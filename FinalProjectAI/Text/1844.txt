The transition from high school to college-level study typically requires students to develop new skills, take different approaches, and invest significantly more time in their academics.
Our staff in both the academic resource center and office of disability services can work with students to:

Better understand their academic needs
Establish and track progress towards self-determined goals
Adapt and refine their approaches to learning
Develop organization and planning skills
Improve academic decision-making

In exploring a studentâs approach to learning, our staff may explore opportunities related to:

Time management
Concentration
Procrastination
College-level reading
Notetaking
Study strategies
Memory
Test-taking
Effective use of academic resources

As a first-year student, it is easy to become overwhelmed. Our staff can help students navigate this transition and better understand themselves as learners. Because the goal of academic coaching is self-sufficiency, we expect appointment frequency will vary over time based on each studentâs place in their development. Some students may benefit from a regular check-in during critical transition periods while others may benefit from a handful of meetings over the course of one semester. All students may schedule a weekly appointment.
Students working with the office of disability services receive academic coaching through their assigned disability services specialist. All other students receive academic coaching through the academic resource center. To schedule an appointment, simply stop by our offices located on the lower level of Seegers Union.
General inquiries regarding academic coaching should be directed to: David Hallowell, assistant dean for academic life, at 484.664.3433 or davidhallowell@muhlenberg.edu.

deluca runs football team past f&m





The defense held F&M to six first downs and forced six three-and-outs. The Dips had only two plays of longer than 9 yards, and of their six completed passes, three went for negative yards. 



Poor weather conditions forced the Muhlenberg football team to simplify its game plan for its Family Weekend game against Franklin & Marshall:

1. Hand off to John DeLuca.

2. Repeat as necessary.

DeLuca rushed for 177 yards on a career-high 42 carries, including 13 on an epic second-half 

drive, as the Mules remained undefeated with a 17-6 win.

The Mules (7-0, 5-0), ranked fourth in Division III by the American Football Coaches Association, extended their regular-season winning streak to 18 games. They have also won 13 straight Centennial Conference games and 12 consecutive home contests.

Ahead 14-6, Muhlenberg put the game away with a 21-play, 72-yard drive that consumed 11:27 and culminated with a 42-yard field goal by sophomore Michael Katz. Taking possession at their own 3 with 1:38 left in the third, the Mules rushed the ball 17 times on the drive, with DeLuca gaining 54 yards on his 13 totes.

Until that drive, the teams 


Volleyball Falls to F&M



The Muhlenberg volleyball team suffered a damaging loss in its home finale, 3-0 to Franklin & Marshall. The teams entered the day tied for the fifth and final Centennial Conference playoff spot.

Seniors Megan Eiser amd Danielle Losonci, honored prior to the match, had team highs of 28 assists and 13 digs, respectively. Junior Liz Dean paced the attack with 11 kills.

The Mules (16-9, 4-4) finish up on the road with Ursinus and Gettysburg next week and will probably need to win both matches to make the playoffs.

had trouble finding a rhythm on offense due to the rain and wind. Both first-half touchdowns were set up by special teams. A fumbled punt gave the Diplomats (3-4, 2-3) possession on the Muhlenberg 31 with 8:00 left in the second quarter, setting up a 4-yard touchdown run eight plays later. The extra point try failed.

The Mules’ next drive went nowhere, but senior David Mazzola’s punt rolled 



Senior Mike Nolan (64) threw a crushing block to spring Santagato (7) for a first-down scramble on the long drive.




dead at the 6-yard line. Muhlenberg got the ball back on the F&M 37 after a punt and needed only four plays to take the lead, with senior Eric Santagato running 18 yards on a scramble for his 21st career rushing touchdown.

DeLuca scored Muhlenberg’s second touchdown on a 6-yard run with 4:15 left in the third. The key play of the 48-yard drive was a 21-yard run by Santagato after he bobbled the snap and had to scramble.

The Mules held possession for 23:08, and the F&M offense was on the field for only 17 plays, in the second half. 

DeLuca’s 42 carries were the most by a Muhlenberg runner since 2003 and three short of the school record. His 177 yards put him over 1,000 for the second straight year. Santagato threw for only 90 yards on 11-of-21 passing but rushed for 57 yards on six carries. 

The Mule defense, led by senior linebacker Matt Rathbun (eight tackles), held the Diplomats to 129 total yards. Two quarterbacks were a combined 6-of-18 for just 41 yards, 38 of which came on one play.

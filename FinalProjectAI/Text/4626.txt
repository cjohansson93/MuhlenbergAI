Travel Journal

barbados day two:not a typical monday


The second installment in a journal of the Muhlenberg field hockey team’s trip to Barbados by senior Jess Kasza:

First of all, Barbados is beautiful. 


Our hotel is right on the beach and the staff is great. Second, today definitely did not feel like a Monday. Don't get me wrong, I feel for those 
of you who had early and long Monday mornings but I just have to tell you that we had a great time today. In the morning we got up around 
7:30 a.m. and met the team out on the beach to get our legs 




loosened up from our long day yesterday. 
We were all ready to go in shorts and tank tops at 8 except for one room of girls who had a miscommunication with our coach and came strolling 
down with their bathing suits/sunglasses on and beach bags in hand. Naturally we made fun of them for a while as we did some team sprints 
barefoot in the sand. 

After that we ate our breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was good and deserved about a 3.5 out of 5 (extra points for delicious bacon and 
pineapple juice). With breakfast finished, the three girls running in their bathing suits turned out to be the smart ones as they just walked 
straight down to the beach after eating. The rest of us got changed and met them there for a relaxing day in the sun and in the water. 

Around noon we all took a walk around to find some lunch and see what kind of stores were nearby. A few of us stopped at a place called 
Just Grillin' which was okay; I would say about a 3.25 on the scale. We then rested up for practice which started at 4 p.m. 
(after a nice van ride through the city). It was great having the team together finally after softball, injuries and semesters abroad left the 
field hockey team with 10 players in the spring (about six of whom were actually healthy). 
We just had a lot of fun being on the field, and practice flew by. 

We got back in the van and headed back to the hotel to shower and change for our dinner. Dinner tonight was at a place called Bert's; very good, 
at least a 4 out of 5.  

It was very interesting to see the color that everyone got from the sun today; there were some extremely odd tan-lines going on 
(cough ... Cait Teegarden). Let's just say that when we get back we are going to be extremely different shades of colors than when we left. 

For now though, it is definitely bed time. Check back tomorrow to see how our first game goes!

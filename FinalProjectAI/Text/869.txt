SGA Committee Representation
The work of student government is done largely in committee. In addition to five internal standing committees, the SGA is responsible for placing students on several institutional and faculty committees to represent the student viewpoint.
If you have an interest in serving on an institutional or faculty committee or are a faculty member or administrator seeking student representation, please contact the SGA Executive Secretary.

Standards
The Student Government Standards Committeeis tasked with upholding the standards of the Student Government Association. This includes but not limited to: dress code, decorum, internal operations such as attendance, point system, and disciplinary proceedings as outlined by the Bylaws and the Standing Rules. 
DEIThe Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committee advocates for the needs of marginalized identities in the Muhlenberg community and beyond through frequent collaboration with students, student groups, departments, offices, faculty, staff, and administration. As it creates guidelines, education opportunities, outreach, and collaborative structural change for all community members, the DEI committee prioritizes listening to voices that are usually not represented in college decision-making while holding college spaces accountable for DEI advances. The DEI committee is also tasked with responding to problematic incidents on campus with action items and structural plans to prevent reoccurring issues from happening and to inspire change beyond one incident.  We draft plans based on student input through marginalized identity advisor positions and SGA representatives, widespread surveys, regular conversation, and consistent research on DEI issues.
 
Internally, the DEI committee is in charge of leading DEI education to integrate responsiveness and advocacy more actively into SGA culture. DEI collaborates with the general assembly, the three committees, (Finance, Campus Engagement, and Standards) and institutional committee heads on education and creating programming, ensuring that SGAâs internal process is representative of marginalized identity groups (through a bifaceted process of increasing representation within SGA while enhancing outreach beyond SGA). Specifically, within the committees, DEI does the following:
 

Finance Committee â collaborates in providing financial support and mentorship to marginalized students and student groups while encouraging DEI guidelines and support for all clubs and organizations. 

 

Campus Engagement â collaborate in planning and organizing events and activities and communication (email and social media) regarding DEI specific resources available to students. 

 

Standards â collaborate in implementing new internal policies to SGA such as meeting structure, requirements, education, and other guidelines specific to promoting DEI causes. 

 

Institutional Committees- engages in monthly meetings that include research, discussion, and establishing a tangible framework for institutional committee heads to be DEI advocates

 

General Assembly- engage in weekly DEI sharing among members, bring DEI initiatives to general assembly for input and further collaboration between committee members

 
Ultimately and most importantly, DEI is a wide-reaching committee that is here to listen and work toward positive change that prioritizes the needs of marginalized identities in any facet of the college that needs further attention.

Every February, Muhlenberg celebrates Black History Month, with campus-wide programming sponsored by the Office of Multicultural Life, the  and the . 
In recent years, the celebration has embraced a theme that ties together a central element across the events and programs. In 2021, during the theme âBlackness, Disability and our Current Moment,â the Muhlenberg community explored the individuals and causes central to the historic and current Black liberation movements as well as the intersections of Blackness and disability. That yearâs programming also included a Black Excellence Celebration.
In 2022 the Muhlenberg community embraced the beauty and power of the Black experience with the theme âA Love Letter to Blackness.â This uplifting theme was designed to express love for Blackness in a world full of anti-Blackness.
Programming included a special performance by poet Lester Mayers, a film screening and discussion around Judas and the Black Messiah and the unveiling of a newly-mined historic record of the Black experience at Muhlenberg College. 
The month-long celebration concluded with the traditional Black History Month gala, which features a keynote speech by Allentown community leader Hasshan Batts.

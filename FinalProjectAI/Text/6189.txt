Women's Basketball Knocked Off by Fords
 Wednesday, January 25, 2012 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg fans who came to watch the Mule women’s basketball team play Haverford expected to see some history.

They got their wish, but it wasn’t quite what they were hoping to see.

Thanks to their best shooting night of the season, the Fords (13-5, 8-5) beat Muhlenberg (14-3, 9-3) for just the second time ever, 58-55.

The loss snapped Muhlenberg’s 38-game winning streak in the series, the longest against one opponent in school history. It also dropped the Mules 1.5 games behind Johns Hopkins, which won at third-place Franklin & Marshall, for first place in the Centennial Conference.

Haverford, which is ranked 17th in Division III scoring defense, held the Mules to their second-lowest shooting percentage and regulation point total this season. But it was Haverford’s offense that pushed it over the top.

Shooting 47.9 percent from the floor (11.9 percent higher than their season average), the Fords grabbed a 29-25 lead at the break.

Muhlenberg responded out of the locker room by scoring the first eight points of the second half and grabbed a five-point lead at the 14:46 mark.

But Haverford, which had made one of its first seven 3-point attempts, hit three straight from beyond the arc to jump back in front, 43-41, with less than 10 minutes to play.

The Mules tied the game at 47 on a layup by junior Alita Zabrecky and a free throw from sophomore Erin Laney, but Haverford got a layup and a three to grab the lead for good.

Muhlenberg had a chance to tie it when senior Katy Rossino grabbed an offensive rebound and called timeout under the basket with 0.3 seconds left. But the Fords got a hand on the ensuing inbounds pass to seal the win.

Zabrecky (right) and Laney led the Mules with 13 and 11 points respectively, and junior Kate Clawson added nine.

Senior Alexandra Chili scored seven points and pulled down a team-high seven rebounds. She is just four points away from the Muhlenberg all-time scoring mark for men or women of 1,788.

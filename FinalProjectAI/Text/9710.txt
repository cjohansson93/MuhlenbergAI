Chemistry Department Mission Statement

The Chemistry Department provides a strong foundation in science for students with a wide variety of goals. Our curriculum balances breadth in the traditional branches of chemistry with advanced electives in highly specialized areas. Students learn through class and laboratory work, and hands-on study with modern scientific equipment is emphasized. Close faculty-student interaction is found at all levels of instruction including independent research under the direction of a faculty mentor. Students develop critical thinking, scientific inquiry, and communication skills and prepare for futures that will serve the public good. Our program maintains American Chemical Society certification.

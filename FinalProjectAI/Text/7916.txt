A week after getting their first taste of collegiate competition at King’s, four freshmen on the Muhlenberg 
wrestling team got their first taste of victory at the Ursinus Fall Brawl.

Freshman Will Lamb advanced the furthest among the Mules, going 4-2 at 149. His first career win was a
pin, and he also recorded a technical fall and a major decision before losing in the consolation quarterfinals.

Freshman Mark Gutierrez (right) also broke into the win column with a pin at 141.
Classmates Anthony Ware (149) and Jake Gordon (165) notched their first
career victories by decision.

Another freshman, Sean Kelly, who did not wrestle last week, won his first career bout at 157.

womens basketball beats Bullets in physical CC showdown


During every timeout down the stretch, Alita Zabrecky grabbed a bag of ice and held it to her cheek.

The sophomore forward had received an elbow to the face and was trying to keep the swelling down so she could still see.

Fortunately for the Mules, the ice did the trick for Zabrecky but did not cool their free throw shooting as the Muhlenberg womens 



Men Suffer First Loss


The Muhlenberg men's basketball team dropped its Centennial Conference opener to 2010 CC runner-up Gettysburg.

The Bullets led 20-10 before the Mules (3-1, 0-1) stormed in front with a 14-0 run. But Gettysburg regained the lead by halftime and stayed ahead the entire second half.

Freshman Austin Curry scored a career-high 21 points for Muhlenberg, and senior Evan Tozer added 11.

physical game and that happens sometimes, Zabrecky said of her shiner. Luckily it wasnt too bad. And luckily we were able to hang on for the win.

The matchup between the top two teams in the CC preseason poll featured six lead changes and six ties. Both defenses made scoring difficult as neither team shot better than 36.2 percent from the field.

After the Bullets jumped ahead early, Muhlenberg made a run that included eight straight points from Zabrecky to take a five-point lead with eight minutes to play in the first half. The Mules would hold the lead until a bucket at the buzzer put Gettysburg (2-1, 0-1) ahead by one at the break.

Carrying that momentum, the Bullets went on 6-0 run out of the locker room to lead by seven. But once again the Mules (4-0, 1-0) responded immediately with three buckets from freshman Leeann Lanza and one layup each from Alexandra Chili and Alexandra Berlin to go up by one.

We didnt panic when they came out and went up in the second half, Zabrecky said. We

did a really good job of staying calm and sticking with our offense. We also started to play a lot better defense.

The Mules limited Gettysburg to just 9-of-31 
shooting (29.0 percent) after halftime. They also finished with nine steals, including five from Zabrecky, and seven blocks on the night.

But even with the increased pressure, the Bullets still managed to tie the game at 52 with 7:28 to play.

From there Muhlenberg made its home at the foul line. Nine of the Mules final 11 points came on free throws. Muhlenberg also limited the Bullets to just four field goals over the final seven-and-a-half minutes of play.

And when Gettysburg pulled within one on a three-pointer with 2.3 seconds to play, Chili calmly knocked down a pair of foul shots to ice the game. 

Zabrecky led the Mules with 19 points to go along with 7 rebounds and 5 steals, while Chili added 17 points. Lanza, meanwhile, just missed a double-double, finishing with 10 points and 9 boards.

The win gives Muhlenberg an early advantage over a Bullet team that advanced to the Sweet 16 last season. But Zabrecky said the win means little at this point of the season, and she expects another physical battle when the two teams meet by the battlefield. But hopefully there will not be a need for any more ice. 

Coming down the stretch we kind of all just said, This is Gettysburg, we want this. And we just worked our butts off, she said. This is a big win, but its still early in the season and teams progress during the year. So the next time we play them is going to be the real big matchup.

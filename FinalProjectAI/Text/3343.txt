softball sweeps CC awards




Sophomores Ashley Brewer and Alyssa Bruckner of the Muhlenberg softball team were both honored by the Centennial Conference.

Brewer (left) was named player of the week for the second time this season. She hit .615 with five runs scored, two doubles and two RBI in four games. Brewer went 4-for-4 and tossed a two-hit shutout in the first game of the McDaniel doubleheader. In a 2-0 win vs. Haverford, she drove in the first run with a double and scored the second.

For the season, Brewer leads the CC in batting with a .435 average. 

Bruckner (right) was selected as pitcher of the week for the second time in three weeks after pitching back-to-back shutouts against McDaniel and Haverford. She allowed 12 hits in 14 innings in the two games, walking none and striking out four. Her shutout against Haverford came after the Mules had lost the first game 8-0 and marked the first time the Fords were blanked in a CC game this year. Bruckner has allowed only three runs in her last 34 innings.

Bruckner is 8-5 with a 1.90 ERA, with six of her wins coming by shutout. Muhlenberg has tied a school record with 10 shutouts this year.

The Mules went 3-1 on the week to clinch a CC playoff berth. They are percentage points out of first place with one week left in the regular season.

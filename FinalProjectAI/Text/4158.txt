siebold scores seven inrainy men’s lax senior day win


When Brent Siebold looked at the weather conditions  cold, wind, heavy rain  for the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse game against nationally ranked Rensselaer, he expected it to be a low-scoring contest.

Fortunately, the power of Siebolds shot was better than his 




Rispoli's 11 ground balls tied for the third-most by a Mule in a game. With 67 ground balls for the season, he is five away from tying the
school record.




power of prediction. The senior tied a school record with seven goals as the Mules withstood a fourth-quarter rally to defeat the No. 19 Engineers, 13-11, on Senior Day.

Seven goals on a rainy day  I wish it had been a nice day, said Siebold, whose previous Muhlenberg career high was four. We stuck to our game plan today on offense. I saw the matchup that I had and tried to take advantage.

It was a great day all around even though it was raining. My grandparents were here to see me play, so that was great. People were making plays left and right. It was a fun game to play.

Most of the fun belonged to the Mules (5-7) for 
the first three quarters. Siebold broke up an RPI clearing attempt less than two minutes into the game and fed freshman Tommy Glancy for the first goal of the game. 

Siebold added two goals of his own before the first quarter was half over, giving Muhlenberg a 3-0 lead 




Siebold tied another school record with eight points, which game him an even career total of 100. He moved into second place on the Mules' all-time
list with 78 career goals.




before the Engineers (8-4) even took a shot.

Siebold finished his second straight hat trick early in the second quarter and had five goals by the end of the third quarter, which ended with Muhlenberg ahead, 9-4, against a team that came in 20th in Division III in scoring offense and 23rd in scoring defense.

Much of the Mules success in the first three quarters was a direct result of their ability in the X. Junior Nick Rispoli and sophomore Ian Jones combined to win 14 of 16 faceoffs in the first 45 minutes, most of the time going up against a player who was 16-of-20 on faceoffs last year in RPIs 12-7 win against Muhlenberg.

We definitely remembered last year  Jonesy and me didnt have a good day, said Rispoli, who finished 13-of-20 to break the school record of 100 faceoffs won in a season. We had our day today. In the offseason we did a lot of work on faceoffs. You really dont notice until after the game how many you won and how many you lost. We just both go out there trying to give our team possession.

The teams traded goals to start the fourth quarter, with Glancy

completing his first career hat trick, to make the score 10-5. Then RPI started to make things interesting, running off three straight goals in a span of 47 seconds to cut the gap to two.

Sophomore Doug Rheiner stopped the run temporarily with his second goal of the game, but the Engineers put in two more shots 40 seconds apart, and suddenly it was a one-goal game (11-10) with 4:13 to play.

Thats the reason theyre a top-20 team. You have to play all four quarters, said Siebold. When it came down to the wire I knew we needed to settle down and stay relaxed. We needed guys to step up, and they got it done.

The first to step up was Rispoli, who won the ensuing faceoff, and 44 seconds later Siebold netted his sixth goal to give Muhlenberg a two-goal lead again. With the Engineer goalie roaming around to double the ball, Siebold shot into the empty net with a minute remaining to finally clinch the Mules second win against a nationally ranked team this season. RPI scored a meaningless goal with 3.2 seconds left.

The victory gave Muhlenberg back-to-back wins for the first time this season heading into Wednesdays key Centennial Conference home game against first-place Dickinson. And it made for a memorable day for the seven seniors (pictured below with their parents), all of whom contributed to the win.

Oliver Baron and Mike Horowitz split time in goal, and Andy Curley started on defense. Charlie Helm, who had not scored a goal in his Mule career before last Saturday, made it two in two games. Siebolds Mountain Lakes High School classmates, Tom Brant and Zachary Armstrong each recorded an assist, with Brant adding three caused turnovers and four ground balls.

Coming in, I was a grade behind them, so I used to hang out with them all the time, said Rispoli of the seniors. Theyre really good guys on and off the field, and theyre always there for you. They really love the game of lacrosse, and it was great to get a win for them.

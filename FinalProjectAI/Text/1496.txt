Thursday, January 20, 2022
THAW is the one night each year when alumni and friends gather across the country and around the world to celebrate the College and each other. This is a great chance to catch up with your 'Berg friends or meet Mule neighbors you didn't know you had. Join the tradition!
This year we are excited to re-introduce in-person THAW events while continuing to support virtual events.

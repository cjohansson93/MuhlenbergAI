women’s basketball:up in rankings, back in time


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team moved up in three polls this week.

In the important NCAA regional rankings, the Mules swapped places with Scranton and are now ranked fourth in the Mid-Atlantic. They have faced three



of the other five teams in the rankings, going 2-1 in those games.

The rankings, with in-region and overall records through games of Sunday in parentheses:
1. Moravian (17-2/18-2)
2. Lebanon Valley (19-1/19-2)
3. Messiah (16-1/18-2)
4. Muhlenberg (16-3/16-3)
5. Scranton (15-3/17-3)
6. Gettysburg (19-2/19-2)

Muhlenberg also moved up to No. 18 in the national Division III polls released by D3hoops.com and
the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.

The Mules’ first game with the new rankings will be their home game against Bryn Mawr tomorrow night. The team will be celebrating Retro Night,
wearing uniforms from the early 2000s, warming up in tie-dyed shirts and playing music from the 1960s and 1970s in warmups. Fans attending the game
are encouraged to wear attire from the 1960s and 1970s and to bring their own positive vibes.

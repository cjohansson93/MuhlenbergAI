rutt wins title on new courts


With the U.S. Open winding down in Queens, Muhlenberg ushered in its “U.S. Open-styled-tennis-courts” era by hosting the Muhlenberg Fall Classic in men’s tennis.

Sophomore Jordan Rutt (left) helped inaugurate the newly painted blue-and-green courts in style, coming back to win the No. 4 singles bracket. Rutt defeated a Wilkes player in the first round – the only singles loss suffered by the Colonels in the tournament – and posted a 3-6, 6-1, (10-5) win against a Moravian opponent in the final.

Rutt also teamed up with classmate Zach Adler to win the consolation match at No. 1 doubles. Adler (No.2 ) and senior Matt Kral (No. 6) reached the finals in their respective singles brackets.

The Office of Health Professions Advising works with faculty advisors to build customized academic plans that address the specific goals of students pursuing a career in health and medicine. We work to advance the quality of the undergraduate preprofessional studentâs lifelong learning process. 
Through self-assessment workshops, research opportunities, experiential learning, competency development and extensive preparation for the professional school application process, prehealth students are challenged to discover and define their individual career goals.

1 course unit
Examines influences of mass media on participatory democracy and its cultural forms and the history, production, representation, and consumption of media in society.  Introduces students to social science approaches to the study of communication phenomena, including the logic of inquiry, standards of evidence, and grounds for making claims about communicative behaviors.  Topics may include social media, images and effects, corporate media culture, organizational structures of journalism, emergence of consumer culture, the Internet and digital media environments, and audience identification and interpretation of media.  Meets general academic requirement SL.
 COM 231 - Documentary Research

Explores the American tradition of social documentary, focusing on milestone projects, including the work of James Agee and Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, William Carlos Williams, and Robert Coles.  Oral, visual, and textual modes of production are examined.  Special focus is given to new digital forms of representation and their impact on production, distribution, and consumption.  Framing this investigation are the ethical issues that emerge when rendering and representing individualsâ lives.  Students are introduced to the fundamental skills of investigative research, interviewing, gathering and interpreting information, and using print and electronic archives and research, and produce their own multi-media documentary projects.

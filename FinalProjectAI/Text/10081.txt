Teaching Interests
My primary specialty is English Romanticism, but I also teach courses in the Decadent movement of the 1890s, Frankenstein and its adaptations, fairy tales, literature and the visual arts, Hemingway and Fitzgerald and the literature of the Vietnam war. My classes are discussion-oriented and based on close readings of texts, images and films.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsI have published on Keats, Shelley and Severn as well as on Romanticism and the visual arts. I am currently at work on a book devoted to the American illustrator and wood-engraver, Lynd Ward, who is known as the father of the graphic novel.

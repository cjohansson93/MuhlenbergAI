late heroics lift baseball to split



Lightning struck twice, but it caused permanent damage only once.

Down to its last out, the Muhlenberg baseball rallied to tie the score in both games of its Centennial Conference doubleheader against Gettysburg. In the first game, the Mules went on to score the winning run in the same inning, but in the second game the Bullets prevailed in extra innings.

The split – both by 6-5 finals – gave Muhlenberg a 3-1 record in its

first week of CC play. That matches the team’s best start in the league, achieved previously in 2005 and 2006.

In the first game, the Mules (9-12-1 overall) trailed 5-4 heading into the bottom of the seventh. Junior Dan Fisher started the inning with his third hit of the game, a single up the middle, but the next two batters made outs.

Senior Edward Risener kept the inning going by working out a walk after falling behind 1-2. Sophomore Bobby Spindler followed by dumping a ball into shallow center, bringing home the tying run.

After a pitching change, senior Chris Costa walked on four pitches to load the bases. Sophomore Eli Branzburg, who had two hits in the game, hit a slow chopper to third. The third baseman’s throw pulled the first baseman off the bag, allowing pinch-runner Adam Scarzafava to score the winning run.

Muhlenberg trailed the Bullets (9-12, 2-2) by three runs after five innings of the second game, but four scoreless relief innings by senior Mike Misciagna enabled the Mules to tie the game with single runs in the sixth, seventh and ninth.

The stage was set for the bottom of the ninth when senior Joseph Barrese worked out of a second-and-third, nobody out jam in the top of the inning, tagging a Gettysburg runner attempting to score on a passed ball for the third out. Fisher again was the catalyst, singling after the first two batters made out. After advancing to second on a short wild pitch, he scored easily on junior Eric Pomroy’s line drive single to center.

Pomroy made it around to third on an infield error, but he was stranded there, and Gettysburg scored the winning run in the 10th on a triple and sacrifice fly.

Fisher went 5-for-9 in the twinbill, raising his average to .378.

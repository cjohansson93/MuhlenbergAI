Football Rolls Past McDaniel for Homecoming Win

In order to post its biggest shutout win in 89 years, the Muhlenberg football team needed big plays on defense, offense and special teams. And that was just in 
the first quarter.




Senior Peter Sorrento cemented the win in the fourth quarter with his first career interception, returning it 59 yards.



The Mules scored off all three phases of the game in the first 13 minutes and went on to shut out McDaniel, 58-0, on Homecoming Saturday.

The margin of victory was the largest by the Mules (2-1, 1-1) in a shutout since a 67-0 blanking of East Stroudsburg in 1924. 
It had been since 1984 since they scored more than 50 points in a shutout (52-0 vs. Lebanon Valley).

Muhlenberg held a 505-205 edge in total yards in shutting out the Green Terror (1-2, 1-1) for the third time in four years.

Freshman Nick Palladino, making his first career start, was 23-for-29 for 264 yards and a touchdown. His lone pick was on the final play of the 
first half. The Mules, meanwhile, forced four turnovers, blocked two kicks and never punted.

On the first play from scrimmage, freshman cornerback John Feaster intercepted a pass and returned it 20 yards to the McDaniel 15. 
Two plays later, sophomore wide receiver Mike Harris ran a sweep around right end into the end zone from 10 yards out.




DiCarlo led the Mules with a career-high 86 rushing yards.



Junior Cody Geyer returned a Green Terror punt 20 yards to set up the Mules near midfield for their next possession, 
which ended nine plays later with a Kevin Van Laar 2-yard touchdown run midway through the quarter.

McDaniel’s best chance to score came on its drive, thanks to a 46-yard run to the Mule 26. On fourth down from the 10, junior Kevin Cellary 
blocked a field goal try. Senior Kory Crichton picked up the ball at the 28 and returned it to the McDaniel 36. About to be tackled, 
he lateraled it to junior Michael Long, who carried the final 40 yards for a touchdown.

The 72-yard play is believed to be the first blocked field goal return for a touchdown in program history.

Long later added a touchdown reception and finished as the leading receiver with eight catches for 87 yards. Junior Connor Winter 
added three field goals, all between 31 and 36 yards, and reserve running backs Thomas DiCarlo and Kamal Kendrick scored fourth-quarter touchdowns,
the latter coming on a pass from sophomore Anthony Schwab.

Crichton led the defense with 10 tackles and a pass breakup. Junior Jeremey Thomas added six tackles, including two for loss, a forced fumble and a blocked punt.

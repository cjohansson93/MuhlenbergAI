The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team led for exactly one minute of 38 seconds of its game at McDaniel, and it was the right 1:38 for a



Senior Megan Wilson scored her sixth goal of the season on a free-position shot in the first half.



 team that is doing everything right.

The Mules tied a school record with their sixth straight win, defeating the Green Terror 15-14 in overtime despite playing from behind the entire game.

The win avenged two losses to McDaniel last year, one in the last game of the regular 

season that cost Muhlenberg a home playoff game and the second four days later in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs. In its two games this week, Muhlenberg beat teams that were responsible for three of its five losses last year.

After a long bus trip, the Mules (8-1, 4-1) got off to a shaky start, falling behind 4-1 in the first 7:23 of the game. The teams traded goals the rest of the half, which ended with McDaniel (6-5, 2-3) ahead, 9-6.

Muhlenberg scored the first two goals of the second half to close to within one, but the Green Terror appeared to pull away when it scored three straight goals to open up a 13-9 lead with 8:37 left in regulation.

Junior Amanda McGovern converted a feed from sophomore Danielle Rosen to make it 13-10, and freshman Angela Napoletano scored with 4:33 left to put the Mules two goals down.

Senior Ruth Morrongiello scored her second goal of the game with 1:02 on the clock, then fed McGovern for the tying goal with just 40 ticks on the clock.

McDaniel scored the first goal of overtime, but again the Mules came back. Morrongiello tied the game at 14-all with 47 seconds left in the first overtime period, and McGovern gave Muhlenberg its one and only lead by netting her fourth goal of the game with 1:38 left.

In their last four games, the Mules have won twice in overtime, both times coming back late in regulation on the road.

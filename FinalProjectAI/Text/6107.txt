Track Teams Dressed for Success in First Meet
 Friday, January 13, 2012







					 


The Muhlenberg track and field teams debuted their new uniforms and inaugurated their 2012 season at Kutztown’s Golden Bear Invitational.



Junior Samantha Mayden, who had previously worn the red uniform to the NCAA Championships during the 
cross country season, was just as successful in it to start the track campaign, winning the mile. She ran seven seconds faster than she did in the same meet last year.

Although Mayden was the lone Mule to come in first, several had noteworthy performances. 

Junior Ryan Hellings (below) set a personal best in the pole vault, although he didn’t know how good it really was at first. After clearing 12-7¼, he took a stab at what he thought was 13-1¼. But the official had erred and set the height at 13-7¼. Hellings, whose previous indoor best was 12-11½, cleared it anyway, vaulting to third on the all-time performance list.

Junior Isaiah Vaughn showed no effects of the injury that 
sidelined him for part of the football season, running 6.73 (0.08 seconds off his personal best) to qualify for the final in the 55 meters. He then topped that with a 6.72 in the final.



Senior Marc Brookland placed second in both the long and triple jumps. His long jump distance was less than three inches short of his personal best.

Senior Peter Rice came in second in the 400 meters, running two-tenths of a second faster than he did last year at Kutztown en route to his record-breaking season.

For the women, sophomore Stephanie Carnevale (above) recorded the third-fastest qualifying time in the 55 hurdles (8.80), beating her previous personal best of 8.93 and moving to second on the all-time performance list.

Junior Tara Keegan placed in the top six in three events, finishing third in the triple jump, fifth in the 400 meters and sixth in the long jump.

Junior Erica Bash posted the third-fastest 1,000-meter time in program history while placing second.

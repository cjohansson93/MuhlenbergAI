MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY RANKED IN REGION



The Muhlenberg men’s cross country team is ranked ninth in the Mideast Region in the preseason poll released this week by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.

The Mules placed fourth at the regional meet last year and went on to earn a bid to the NCAA Division III Championships, where they finished 29th.

Of the eight teams ranked ahead of Muhlenberg, four (Haverford, Dickinson, Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore) are in the Centennial Conference.

After warming up with a non-scored 4K run last Friday, the Mules open their season in earnest at the Lehigh Valley Championships tomorrow evening.

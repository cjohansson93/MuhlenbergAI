 Men’s basketball preview



mckeon named cc player of the year 


For the second time in six days, junior Kelly McKeon of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team took home a player-of-the-year award. And this time she didn’t have to share it.

McKeon was voted Centennial Conference player 


of the year by the league’s coaches. Last Thursday, she and Kate Harrison of Moravian were named Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball co-players of the year.

Joining McKeon on the All-CC first team was 



sophomore Alexandra Chili. This is the third straight year and the fourth time in the last five years that the Mules placed two members on the All-CC first team.

McKeon (left) garnered first-team honors for the second year in a row after earning honorable mention as a freshman. She ranks second in the CC in assists (109), seventh in rebounding (7.5 per game) and eighth in scoring (13.4 points per game); she is the only player in the top 10 in all three categories. McKeon also leads the CC and ranks fifth in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.27) and is sixth in the conference in steals (55). She enters this weekend’s CC playoffs at Muhlenberg 20 points away from 1,000 for her career.

McKeon is the second Muhlenberg player to be named CC player of the year, but the first to do it solo. Meghan Courtney shared the top honor in 2007. McKeon also is the sixth junior in the 17 years of the league to be named player of the year.

Chili (right) moved up to the first team after earning second-team honors last year. The third Mule sophomore selected to the All-CC first team, she leads Muhlenberg 
and ranks third in the CC in scoring at 17.6 points per game. Chili tops the CC and ranks 11th in Division III in three-pointers per game (2.92). She also is seventh in the CC in free-throw percentage (.763) and 10th in assists per game (3.08).

The two first-team selections will lead into the CC playoffs a Muhlenberg squad that is nationally ranked again. After a week out of the top 25, the Mules jumped back in. 
They are ranked 22nd in Division III by D3hoops.com and 24th by the 
Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.

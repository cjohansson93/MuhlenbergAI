The Psychology Department at Muhlenberg College is vibrant, with an active faculty and involved students. The psychology major provides excellent preparation for post-graduate work in psychology and a strong liberal arts foundation for students interested in careers in the mental health field, public policy, medicine, law, marketing research and teaching at all levels.
We aim to create a culture of informed engagement. Our students will interact differently with the world as a result of studying psychology and will understand psychology differently through engaging with the world. We cultivate an appreciation for a liberal arts education, including psychologyâs contributions to other disciplines and the contributions of those disciplines to psychology. Students are encouraged to be intellectually curious and adventurous; wrestling with challenges leads to a better understanding of their own and othersâ perspectives.

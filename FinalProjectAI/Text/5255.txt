men’s tennis starts with shutout



The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team started off the 2009 season on the right foot, shutting out Arcadia under the lights.

It’s the first time the Mules have opened a campaign with a shutout since 1998, when the victim was Marywood.

Muhlenberg won all six singles matches in straight sets and dropped only six games in the three doubles contests. The bottoms of the lineups pulled off their own
shutouts, with the No. 3 doubles team of sophomore Wayne Mitchel and junior Matt Kral (left) winning 8-0 and No. 6 singles player Jordan Rutt
sweeping 6-0, 6-0.

Freshman Zach Adler was impressive at the top of the ladder, winning at both No. 1 doubles and No. 1 singles. Mitchell, Rutt, senior Brian Wernick
and junior Yoni Farber also picked up a pair of wins.

Muhlenberg College/Morning Call Pennsylvania Presidential Election Survey: February 2020

In the first Muhlenberg College/Morning Call election poll of 2020, President Donald Trump and the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination are shown to be in a tight race for Pennsylvaniaâs 20 electoral votes. The results of a telephone survey of registered state voters, conducted between February 12 and 20, reveal that only Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders claims a lead over Trump in a head-to-head matchup. 
âDespite former Vice President Joe Bidenâs Pennsylvania roots, state voter polling shows he and President Trump would be tied at 47 percent if the election were held today,â says Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. âThis is a distinct change from just a few months ago. In our November poll when responding to the same question, state voters gave Biden a solid lead at 52 percent, with Trump trailing at 43 percent.â 
âIn our latest poll, while a majority of Pennsylvania voters (54 percent) feel that Trump does not deserve reelection, they gave him high marks for his management of the economy,â says Borick, adding that Trump also earned very negative ratings for his work on health care and the environment.
Key Findings:

Trump narrowly trails in a matchup with Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders (46%-49%); is locked in ties with former Vice President Joe Biden (47%-47%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (47%-47%); and holds slim leads over Senator Amy Klobuchar (45%-44%), former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (46%-45%) and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg (48%-45%). All are within the poll's margin of error of 5.5%.


Since November of 2019, President Trumpâs job approval rating among Pennsylvania voters has modestly improved with 42% approving of his work as President and 50% disapproving, compared to 40% approving and 56% disapproving last fall.


A majority of Pennsylvania voters (54%) feel that President Trump does not deserve reelection, compared with 42% that believe the 45th President deserves a second term in office.


Pennsylvania voters give Trump high marks for his management of the economy (58% approve) but very negative ratings for his work on health care (36% approve) and the environment (31% approve).


While most Pennsylvania voters said the impeachment process did not have an impact on their vote in the presidential election, twice as many (22% to 11%) reported the process made them more likely to vote for President Trump than less likely to support the presidentâs reelection bid.


Pennsylvania voters are fairly divided on the issue of fracking, with 42% indicating they disagree with placing a moratorium on fracking in the state, and 38% agreeing with this policy option.  At the same time, 44% of voters agree that fracking poses a major risk to the health of Pennsylvanians, compared to 36% that disagree with this claim.

Muhlenberg College/Morning Call February 2020 Election Survey (Full Report/PDF)
Methodological Statement:The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 424 registered voters in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between February 12 and 20, 2020.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (136) and cell phones (289). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. The data has been weighted to gender, age, region, party, race and educational attainment to reflect voter population parameters. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above.  In order to reach a representative sample of registered voters, both landlines and cell phones were called up to three times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 8%. The sampling frame for the study is from the registered voters files of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by Christopher P. Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO), in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by the Morning Call and the MCIPO.

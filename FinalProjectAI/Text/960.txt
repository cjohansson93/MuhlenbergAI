Research Interests My lab studies the molecular genetics of development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This microscopic worm has proved a fruitful model for understanding basic biological problems. Our laboratory is studying the mechanisms of animal development, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. We perform experiments that include molecular, genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches. Sleep is a universal behavior among animals, that is regulated by precise pathways in the nervous system. Students in my lab are studying the mechanisms of neuron differentiation and how specific neurons influence insulin signaling to regulate arousal and sleep. We've recently demonstrated a pro-arousal function for insulin hormones and a pro-sleep pathway that uses a different hormonal signal to prompt sleep under conditions of osmotic stress. An understanding of how these pathways work may inform on key questions in the neuroendocrine regulation of behavior in humans. For more detailed information, consult the Wightman Research Lab homepage.

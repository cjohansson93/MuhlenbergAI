Men's Basketball Beaten at Division I Lehigh
 Tuesday, January 8, 2013 - page 2







					 



One of the ingredients in the classic recipe for a big basketball upset – like the one Lehigh pulled off against Duke in the first round of last year’s
NCAA Tournament – is hot three-point shooting. Unfortunately, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team could not find its range from long distance early on
as it tried to upend Lehigh.

The Mules, looking for their first win against a Division I team in 38 years, went cold from the field after the first five minutes and lost to their Lehigh Valley 
foes, 81-46.

Junior Austin Curry gave Muhlenberg a 3-0 lead a minute-and-a-half into the game, and the Mountain Hawks led by only 10-7 after junior Kevin
Hargrove scored in the paint at the 15:14 mark.

But the Mules (8-5) made only one field goal over the last 10 minutes and missed eight straight three-point tries after Curry’s early make. The Mountain
Hawks, meanwhile, shot 53.3 percent in the first half. By the time
sophomore Malique Killing ended the drought by hitting a three from the wing with 3:18 left in the half, Lehigh (10-4) had a 32-11 lead, and that would be
the last time Muhlenberg was within 20.

Curry (right) led the Mules with 15 points, with Hargrove and Killing each scoring 14.

“They’re a good team. Maybe the score didn’t show it, but we competed hard and held our own,” said senior Matt O’Hara, who
dished out five assists. “Their speed, quickness and physicality as Division I athletes was something we’re not used to and allowed them to get a big lead.

“It was a fun experience. We enjoyed it,” added O’Hara of the rare opportunity to play against a Division I team. “It will make us better when
we get back to our conference [Thursday at home vs. Franklin & Marshall] and the speed, quickness and physicality of Division III athletes that we’re used to.”

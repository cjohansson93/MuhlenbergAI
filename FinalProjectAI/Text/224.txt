Medical Leave of Absence and Reduction in Course Load Policy
Purpose:  
The College has traditionally recognized the educational and personal rewards that many students receive from a semester or two away from the campus. Occasionally, faculty members, advisors, or deans may suggest that students withdraw from formal studies to focus on their health and gain fresh perspectives on their intellectual commitments, career plans, and educational priorities.   Medical issues, both physical and mental, encountered by students may require that they remain away from the College for more than the usual College vacation periods. Moreover, certain unforeseeable medical issues may occur during the course of the semester which may impact a studentâs ability to meet the academic expectations of a particular course.  The College, therefore, encourages students to consider carefully their situations, to clarify their objectives, and to consider whether they should temporarily interrupt their study at the College and take a medical leave of absence from all courses or withdraw from specific course(s) for medical reason(s). 
Students who wish to explore the advantages and disadvantages of medical leaves and course withdrawals should confer with the Dean of Students Office, Dean of Academic Life, College faculty advisors, and family. Students are also encouraged to discuss their situations and tentative plans with the Registrar, Business Office, and Financial Aid Office (if applicable).
 
Medical Leave of Absence Policy
Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA):  A student may request a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) for physical health or psychological reasons if during the course of an academic term (Fall or Spring Semesters) he/she/they incurs a condition that prevents him/her/they from meeting the expectations of a student (e.g. unable to attend classes, unable to complete academic responsibilities, etc.) for a period of time during that term. The severity and duration of the problem must be such that it would not be reasonable to expect the student to be able to make up the missed work. Requests for MLOA must be made in writing by the student to the Office of the Dean of Students/ VP of Student Affairs through completion of the âStudent Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ form and must be supported by a licensed health professional in the form of a completed, signed âTreating Healthcare Professional Report Formâ clearly indicating support for the Course Reduction. The Office of the Dean of Students/ VP of Students Affairs, will review the request and may share this request and accompanying medical and/or mental health information with other Muhlenberg College officials including a Health Review Committee, as necessary, for the purpose of review of the request. The student will be notified in writing by the Office of the Dean of Students/ VP of Student Affairs if the request has been approved or denied. The college permits a maximum of 4 semesters of MLOA, LOA, or combination of both.
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE:
1. Assessment and Documentation from Health Care Professional The student should complete an assessment by a licensed medical or mental health practitioner, depending upon the nature of the condition, who will make a recommendation about whether the student has a condition that is preventing him/her from meeting the expectations of a student. The provider must complete the âTreating Healthcare Professional Report: Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ form.Appropriate health practitioners for the purposes of this request must be currently licensed within their state of practice and in good standing in their fields. They must not have an immediate familial relationship with the student. These typically include: physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, social workers, counselors, psychologists, or psychiatrists.If extraordinary circumstances exist in which provider documentation is not available, please discuss with the Dean of Students to make a recommendation for how to proceed with the request.
 2. Student ApplicationThe student must complete the âStudent Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ form.
3. Request,  Submission, Notification, Transcript Notations

The student must submit both the âStudent Applicationâ and âTreating Health Care Professional Report Form- Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ to the Dean of Students Office either by uploading the âTreating Health Care Professional Report Form- Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ when submitting the âStudent Applicationâ or by completing the âStudent Application and having a provider fax the âTreating Healthcare Report Form: Request for Medical Leave of Absenceâ directly to the Office of the Dean of Students/ Vice President of Student Affairs at 484-664-3930.  Both forms must be received in order to be reviewed for a MLOA.
The student must meet with the Dean of Students/ VP of Student Affairs or his/her/their designee  to review the circumstances that prompted the Course Withdrawal request.  The Dean of Students/VP of Student Affairs may request that other college officials, as necessary, review this information for purposes of making a determination about the MLOA.
Decisions will be made by the Dean of Students/ VP of Student Affairs in consultation with the Health Review committee as needed.
Students will receive written notification through their Muhlenberg College email whether their request for MLOA was approved for denied.  This correspondence will also indicate the earliest the student will be eligible for reinstatement if approved for a MLOA.  Once approved, MLOA requests cannot be withdrawn.
The Dean of Students Office will notify the following departments if MLOA is approved:  Registrarâs Office, Controllerâs Office, Financial Aid, Residential Services, Dean of Academic Life, Health and Counseling Services.
 If a student requested a MLOA before the start of the semester and through the first day of classes, no courses will be listed, but the notation âLeave of Absenceâ will appear on the transcript.  After the eighth day of class, if MLOA is approved, all course grades will appear as a âWâ on the transcript along with notation of âLeave of Absenceâ.

4. MLOA Clinical Follow-up:As a condition of accepting a MLOA, the student should complete ongoing treatment as agreed to with a health professional. It is strongly suggested that for the studentâs best interest and greatest likelihood of future success, he/she/they work with a health professional toward the goal of returning to academic life only when a plan has been enacted which helps the student to manage stressors and remain active, engaged, and successful at achieving their academic goals. He/she/they should feel well prepared for the rigors of returning to school after an absence before requesting to reinstatement from a MLOA.

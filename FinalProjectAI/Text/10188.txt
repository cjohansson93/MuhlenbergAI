A Raisin in the Sun
February 20-23, 2020
by Lorraine HansberryDirected by Jeffrey Page, Guest Artist â profile Dramaturg: Beth Schachter
Now celebrating the 60th anniversary of its groundbreaking Broadway premiere, Lorraine Hansberryâs explosive drama takes an unflinching look at the hopes and struggles of an urban black family in 1950s Chicago. 
The members of the Younger family are at a crossroads. Matriarch Lena wants to use her late husbandâs life insurance to move her family out of their cramped South Side apartment. Her son Walter Lee would rather use the money to start a business and become his own man. Her daughter Beneatha plans to go to medical school â but also yearns for a sense of identity, and wishes her family wasnât so desperate for acceptance. And as their simmering tensions intensify, the powerful forces of 1950s America come knocking at the Youngersâ front door. 
Emmy Award nominee Jeffrey Page directs the poignant and enduring story of a family attempting to pursue their dreams and retain their dignity in a harsh and rapidly changing world.

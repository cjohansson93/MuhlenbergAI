Antonini, Daniels earn more accolades





Antonini is only the second Mule, and fourth player in CC history, to be named an All-American more than once.





Daniels had an .889 save percentage and allowed only four goals (one on a penalty kick) in five postseason games.



Even with Varsity Field covered under a blanket of fresh snow the Muhlenberg men's soccer team continues to reap the rewards from one of the most successful seasons in school history.

Junior Cody Anotnini and senior Jason Daniels added to the already long list of Mule accomplishments by being named to the inaugural D3soccer.com All-America team.

Antonini was named a first-team midfielder after ranking in the top 15 in the country with 16 goals and 39 points. His 33 career goals are the eighth most in school history, while his 78 points are ninth on Muhlenberg's all-time list. 

Daniels, meanwhile, wrapped up his Mule career by being named D3soccer.com's second-team goalkeeper. The two-time All-Mid-Atlantic Region selection finished in the top 30 nationally in both save percentage (0.873) and goals-against average (0.60). Daniels compiled a 24-7-8 record, including 13 shutouts, during his two years as a starter and was named first-team All-Centennial Conference each season. 

Antonini and Daniels were two of three CC players honored by D3soccer.com; Swarthmore also had a player named to the first team. The team Muhlenberg beat in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, Stevens, was one of two teams with a pair of first-team selections.

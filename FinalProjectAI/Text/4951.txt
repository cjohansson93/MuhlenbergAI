 Men’s basketball’s national ranks



HOOPSTERS HONORED FOR ACADEMICS
 


They may be a combined 11-2 in Centennial Conference games this season, but senior Alexis Bates of the Muhlenberg womens basketball team and sophomore Spencer Liddic of the mens team have been just as successful in the classroom as they have been on the court.

For that they were named to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Scholar-Athlete Team at a luncheon yesterday at Starters Pub in Bethlehem.



A team captain, Bates (left) has started all 10 games for the ninth-ranked Mules at forward. She is tied for second on the team in rebounding, averaging 4.4 boards per game. For her career she is averaging 4.4 points and 4.3 rebounds per game.

Bates has also been a star student during her four years at Muhlenberg. A double major in business administration and Spanish, she was named to the CC Academic Honor Roll as a sophomore and junior. Now one semester away from graduation, she hopes to work in marketing in New York City.




Said head coach Ron Rohn, I could talk about Lexi for hours and not scratch the surface. She has been on the Deans List every semester and she is a great player for us. When you talk about those people who can light up a room by walking into it, she lights up the entire campus.

Liddic (right) was named to the team for the second straight year. After receiving All-Centennial Conference honorable mention as a freshman, he has continued to improve in his sophomore season. He is second on the Mules in scoring (11.9 points per game), rebounding (8.4 per game), field-goal percentage (.531), free-throw percentage (.792) and blocked shots (17).

Off the court, Liddic is a double major in business administration and finance. With plenty of time to go before graduation, hes yet to decide on a career path, though he sees himself working in business or finance.

I cant say enough good things about Spencer, said head coach Scott McClary. Being a leading scorer doesnt always go hand in hand with academics, but hes done it. Im so impressed with everything he does outside of basketball, from his GPA to being a double major to all the clubs hes involved with.

Being familiar with high marks, Bates and Liddic were both forced to ponder what grades their teams deserve so far in 2009-10.

Id give us an A-minus, said Bates, because we do have a winning record and were ninth in the country. But our primary objective is to notice our strengths and weaknesses and improve our game.

But we deserve an A-plus in having fun, she joked.

Liddic was only slightly tougher on the mens team, which is in a three-way tie for first place in the CC.

We deserve a B-plus, he noted. We started non-conference play shaky  worse than we thought we would  but weve really turned things around.

Men's Lacrosse Comes Up Short Against F&M
 Saturday, March 17, 2012 - page 2







					 





Coleman’s first goal as a Mule came on just the second shot of his career.




The three-leaf shamrock has become one of the main symbols of St. Patrick’s Day. Unfortunately for the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team, three turned out to be an unlucky number in its Centennial Conference opener against Franklin & Marshall.

Playing in front of a loud and energetic Scotty Wood Stadium crowd, the Diplomats jumped out to a three-goal lead, which turned out to be the final margin as they grabbed an 8-5 win.

After spotting F&M (6-1, 1-0) its early advantage, the Mules used a pair of quick tallies late in the second quarter to get back in the game.

Freshman Jon Thomas scored a man-up goal 1:27 before the break, then junior Ian Jones won the ensuing faceoff, beat the midfielders into the offensive zone and rifled a shot into the back of the net just 10 seconds later to make it 3-2.

But the Dips scored with 12 seconds left in the half and added the first three goals of the third quarter to pull ahead by five.

The Mules (2-5, 0-1) would not go away however, and junior Doug Rheiner scored his team-high 16th goal of the season with 2:07 left in the third.

Then junior long-stick defenseman James Coleman caught a pass from senior Corey Aferiat in front of the crease, turned and beat the goalie to make it 7-4 a little more than five minutes into the fourth. 

But that would be as close as Muhlenberg would get as the two teams traded goals to close out the game. The Mules held a 43-28 advantage in shots, but only a 21-19 edge in shots on goal. 

Making the first start of his career, freshman goalie Adam Schlauch made 11 saves, including several from point-blank range.

Jones won five of his 10 faceoffs, and senior Jay Salasko forced a game-high two turnovers.

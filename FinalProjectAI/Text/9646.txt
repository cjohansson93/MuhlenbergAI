When 17 Muhlenberg students visited the main campus of the investment company Vanguard as part of the 2017 Philly Career Road Trip, Brian Fishbone â98 met them at the door. He took them to a conference room where they enjoyed a networking lunch with seven other Muhlenberg alumniâwith grad years ranging from â95 to â17âwho rotated from one table to the next throughout the hour. Then, the students heard from a panel of four other alumni âcrew members,â as Vanguard calls its employees, followed by a small-group discussion with four more alumni. If youâre counting, thatâs nearly a 1:1 student-to-alumni ratio for the day.
âI emailed more people than I thought I would need, and I got close to a 100 percent response rate,â says Fishbone, the diversity and inclusion program manager at Vanguard who worked with the Career Center to organize the visit. âThey all wanted to be a part of it.â
While itâs not unusual for Muhlenberg graduates to take the time to meet with current studentsâalumni in New York City and Washington, D.C., hosted two other Career Road Trips this fallâattracting and retaining so many alumni in one workplace is unique. âPeople choose Vanguard for a lot of the same reasons they choose Muhlenberg,â Fishbone says. âThere are some values and cultural things that are the same.â
For example, Muhlenbergâs liberal arts focus mirrors Vanguardâs rotational track, which allows new employees to sample roles in multiple departments. One of the alumni panelists, Katie Southwick â06, an operations consultant at Vanguard, has had six jobs in her 11 years with the company. âIâve learned so much about what I enjoy and what Iâm good at,â she told the students.
Southwickâs story also appealed to the handful of visitors with majors outside finance, business, economics and accounting. She was a media & communication major and studio art minor who spent a good portion of her undergrad career sketching things she saw around campus. âThere I was, drawing polar bears at Muhlenberg,â she joked, recounting the taxidermied specimen thatâs currently in the stairwell of the New Science Building. âI actually had to Google, âWhat is a mutual fund?â the night before my interview.â
Fishbone says potential Vanguard employees primarily need to know how to work with other peopleâthey offer training on finance, and theyâre a large enough company (with 17,000 employees worldwide and 11,000 in Pennsylvania) that there are ample roles in supporting departments for employees who arenât interested in numbers. He and the other alumni offered advice to help students of all backgrounds get hired at Vanguard or, really, anywhere else.
âDonât be afraid to make mistakes, but only make them once and learn from them,â alumni panelist Jordan Sones â10, senior manager of end user computing, told students. He and the other three panelistsâSouthwick, Brian Talbott â03 and Paul Slowik â86, all Vanguard employees since graduationâstressed the importance of preparing answers to behavior-based interview questions, a major part of the hiring process at Vanguard and many other companies.
Molly Chiodo â18, a business major with a concentration in marketing, signed up for the Philly Career Road Trip after a soccer game prevented her from attending the one in New York. âI was not expecting to love Vanguard as much as I did,â she says. âIn networking with the Muhlenberg alumni, they all seemed very happy with where they were and motivated to continue to thrive in new roles on the crew. I really felt the Muhlenberg vibe in the way that they are a personalized company as well as a close-knit community.â

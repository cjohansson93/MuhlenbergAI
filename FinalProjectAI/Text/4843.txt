track teams explore the great outdoors



Women’s Lacrosse

The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team had a 28-21 advantage in shots and a two-goal lead late in the first half, but couldn’t hang on and lost at undefeated Haverford, 13-10.

The Mules (5-2, 0-2) were up 5-3 before the Fords (8-0, 1-0) scored with less than two minutes to go in the first half. Haverford proceeded to score the first two goals of the second half to go ahead, 6-5. Muhlenberg tied the score at 6-all, but the Fords reeled off the next three goals to take the lead for good.

Muhlenberg staged a last-ditch comeback attempt down 12-8 with under five minutes to play. Back-to-back goals by senior Amanda McGovern made it 12-10, and the Mules had a chance to cut the gap to one on a free-position shot with 2:37 left. The Haverford goalie made the save, however, and the Fords added an insurance goal with 82 seconds on the clock.

McGovern scored three goals for her 26th career hat trick, moving into a tie for fourth on the Mules’ all-time scoring list with 181 career points.

Tennis

The Muhlenberg tennis teams ran into tough competition in Baltimore, falling to the nationally ranked Johns Hopkins teams. The men were shut out by the No. 8 Blue Jays, while the women lost 8-1 to the 18th-ranked team in Division III.

The lone point for the Mules came at No. 1 singles in the women’s match, where junior Caitie Druker came back after losing the first set to win the third, 7-5. Muhlenberg’s top two doubles teams played close matches, both falling 8-6.

The Muhlenberg track and field teams got their outdoor season off to a 




Freshman Lexie Daniells placed fourth in the open 400 and ran the second leg of the 4x400 relay.



terrific start, breaking three school records at the Lafayette Seven-Way Meet.

The most impressive record-breaking performance was by senior Jennifer Lynch, who erased one of the oldest marks in the women’s record book. Lynch won the 3,000 meters in 10:14.55, shattering the previous standard of 10:27.77 set in 1993. That record truly stood the test of time until Lynch came along; every other outdoor school record for the women in track events has been broken since 2004, with the exception of the distance medley relay, which is not normally contested outdoors.

Lynch now owns the outdoor school records in the 3,000 and the 5,000.

Junior Matt Lauletti of the men’s team also broke a somewhat long-standing record in the 3,000. His time of 8:45.91 was good for sixth place and toppled the mark of 8:52.88 that had stood since 2002. Lauletti’s time also was more than four seconds faster than the converted two-mile record of 8:50.08, set in 1975.

The third record setter should come as no surprise: senior Alex Faust broke her own record in the 200 meters with a time of 25.85, which eclipsed the 26.18 she ran as a freshman. Faust finished second in the 200, won the pole vault and anchored the 4x400 relay team that came in fifth.

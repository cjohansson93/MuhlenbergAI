men’s basketball pushes first-place f&m





Freshman Timmy Harwood scored all 5 of his points in a 9-3 run that cut F&M's 10-point lead to four in the second half.


After leading for most of the first half, the Muhlenberg men's basketball team could not withstand Franklin & Marshall's strong second half and fell, 80-73.

The loss dropped the Mules (12-9, 8-6) into a four-way tie for third place in the Centennial Conference with four games to play in the regular season. Muhlenberg hosts second-place Dickinson on Wednesday. Franklin & Marshall (17-4, 12-2) is in first place and ranked 22nd in Division III.

Behind a pair of 3-pointers from junior Spencer Liddic and freshman Austin Curry, and layups by freshman Kevin Hargrove and Curry, the Mules scored the first 10 points of the game.

On the other end of the floor, Muhlenberg's zone defense gave the Diplomats trouble. But F&M rallied late and sunk a pair of free throws with no time left on the clock to go into the locker room with a 32-31 advantage.

The Diplomats started to create some separation midway through the second half, but the Mules refused to go away.

Down eight with three minutes left, Muhlenberg closed to within three on a pair of 3-pointers from senior Evan Tozer and a basket by Liddic in the final 90 seconds. F&M made four free throws in the last 18 seconds to seal the game.

Liddic led the Mules with 21 points, while Hargrove notched his fourth double-double of the season with 17 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. He also turned away five shots to set a Mule single-season record with 59 blocks.

Curry added 15 points and Tozer finished with 11, including a trio of 3-pointers.

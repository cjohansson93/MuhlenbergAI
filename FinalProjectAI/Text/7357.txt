Tennis Swept by Hopkins; Track Sends Five to Moravian
 Saturday, April 19, 2014 - page 3







					 




Though one enjoyed a more successful afternoon than the others, both the Muhlenberg track and field and tennis teams took advantage of the warm weather that showed up for the holiday weekend by testing their mettle against some of the best competition around. Both tennis teams were swept by nationally ranked Johns Hopkins, while track sent a handful of athletes to Moravian’s Greyhound Invitational.

Despite falling to the Blue Jays, ranked No. 3 in Division III, women’s tennis remains firmly in the frantic Centennial Conference playoff chase. With six teams battling for five berths, the Mules (6-4 spring, 5-3 CC) are tied with Dickinson for the fifth and final spot with two league matches remaining. Those two teams will meet next Saturday in the regular-season finale, which will likely be a postseason play-in. In between, Muhlenberg will host 6-1 Swarthmore on Tuesday. 

Men’s tennis played a pair of matches over the weekend, both against ranked opponents. The Mules dropped an 8-1 decision Friday at New Jersey, ranked 19th in the Northeast Region, before falling to Johns Hopkins, slotted No. 6 in Division III.

They only sent five athletes to Moravian, but the Mule track and field teams certainly embraced quality over quantity.

Senior Stephanie Carnevale headlined several impressive performances, placing fourth in the 100-meter hurdles. Her time of 14.79 seconds in prelims is currently ranked 22nd in Division III. 

Sophomore Melanie Tramontina (left), the only other Mule woman to compete, placed eighth in the 1,500 meters and vaulted into sixth on the program’s all-time performance list.

Junior Luke Munyan recorded a personal record in the 1,500 for the men, while senior Jeff Phillips ran a season best in the 400-meter hurdles. Senior Scott Reutter competed in the 100-meter hurdles and the long jump to round out Muhlenberg’s afternoon.

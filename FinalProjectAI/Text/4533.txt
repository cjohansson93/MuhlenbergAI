miller ties record as
women’s soccer shuts out bryn mawr


Amanda Wong expected to be stopping goals this year, not scoring them. Now she's done both.

The freshman began the season as the No. 2 goalkeeper on the Muhlenberg women's soccer team, playing in parts of four games and making eight saves. She has played in the last six games as a midfielder and scored her first career goal to help the Mules to a 4-0 home win against Bryn Mawr.

first half by converting a pass from junior Nicolette Miller - a common theme for the night. Miller tied a school record with three assists and scored the other goal herself.

The win kept Muhlenberg in the thick of the crowded Centennial 




Wong is the third player in program history to score a goal as a field player and make a save as a goalie.




Conference playoff picture, which got even murkier when Ursinus beat Swarthmore. Dickinson is alone in first place with a 6-1 record, and the Mules are one of five teams tied for second at 5-2 with three games remaining in the regular season.

"In the second half of the Dickinson game, Coach just came up to me and said, 'Do you want to play? Go put your field uniform on,'" said Wong of her position change. "I didn't think I'd be playing field, but I want to do whatever I can to help the team. During my club season I played field, so it wasn't new for me.

"When Coach put me in, she told me RUN!" Wong added. "So I try to create plays, 
make runs, get back on defense - whatever the team needs."

It was a great run by Miller that led to her goal. The Mules already had a 2-0 lead on the strength of some nice passing. In the 14th minute, Miller sent the ball from the right wing across the field to senior Lauren Petri at the far post. Petri passed the ball back to the middle of the box, where junior Meghan O'Grady headed it in. 

The goal gave O'Grady 51 career points, making her the 11th player in team history to reach the half-century mark.

The same trio clicked again less than 13 minutes later. This time Petri's pass from the left wing found O'Grady in the box, and she passed it to an open Miller, who put Muhlenberg up 2-0.

With less than 10 minutes to go in the half, Miller made a run down the right sideline, then cut the ball back along the endline. After reaching the box and drawing more defenders, she played the ball back to Wong, who one-timed it with her left foot into the back of the net. 

Petri added her first goal of the season, off another outstanding cross from Miller, midway through the second half to close out the scoring. 

The win brought the Mules (6-6-2) back to the .500 mark after a 1-4-2 start. They are 5-2 in their last seven games, with only a pair of one-goal losses, as they gear up for a possible postseason berth.

"I could tell from the first day of preseason that we were going to get along well," said Wong. "We have great chemistry, and we always fight to the very end no matter what the score. That's what's going to pull us through."

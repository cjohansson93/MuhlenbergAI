Milestone Night for Eiser





Eiser’s nine digs were among the 109 amassed by both teams in the match, which was part of the “Digging for a Cure” program. All 11 Centennial Conference schools joined together to raise money for Living Beyond Breast Cancer, using the dig totals from selected matches in October (Breast Cancer Awareness Month).


Megan Eiser reached a pair of career milestones as the Muhlenberg volleyball team breezed to its second straight win, shutting out Washington to even its Centennial Conference record.

The Mules trailed only twice (1-0 in each of the first two sets) and won by scores of 25-15, 25-14 and 25-16.

In the second set, Eiser recorded her 900th career dig. She is the 11th player in team history to reach that level, and she joined an even more exclusive club early in the third set. When Brittany Williams put Eiser’s pass down on the other side of the net to give the Mules a 4-1 lead, the senior setter became the third Muhlenberg player with 2,000 assists.

Eiser finished the match with 27 assists, and her nine digs and five blocks contributed to an excellent defensive effort. The Mules (13-7, 3-3) recorded 11 blocks, and the Shorewomen had more errors than kills.

Williams and junior Christina Cangelosi tied for the team lead with 12 digs apiece, and freshman Davi Gordon chipped in with 10 digs and eight blocks, the most by a Muhlenberg player this year.

Offensively, junior Phylicia Lee (9 kills), Williams (8) and freshman Jackie Price combined for 24 kills.

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team beat Washington for the 11th straight time, snapping a mini two-game winless streak with a 2-0 shutout.
 
The Mules have won the 11 games by a combined score of 38-3. The Shorewomen have 



Christina O’Grady’s goal was the 13th of her career, second among active players.


not scored a goal on the Mules since 2003. Last year, Muhlenberg won 5-0. 

This game was closer, at least on the scoreboard. Despite outshooting Washington 37-1, the Shorewomen made it tough for the Mules to find the back of the net. 

“Washington had a strong defense tonight,” said junior Jennifer Lynch. “They knew our strengths going in. They knew about our speed and were prepared.” 

“Washington was very good on the counterattack,” said freshman Meghan O’Grady. “We had to be careful where we sent the ball on their end and make sure we were quick to get back in position.” 

Junior Christina O’Grady scored an unassisted goal from 15 yards out with 21:04 left to play in the first. Freshman Nicolette Miller added to the Mules’ lead 15 minutes into the second half, off Meghan O’Grady’s corner kick. 

“We were really aggressive in the box,” added Lynch. “We had trouble finishing, but we got two in and that’s important.” 

Besides a tough Washington defense, Muhlenberg had another issue to deal with: its center back was out of commission for the game. But the Mules showed that they have other players willing to step up into such an important position.
 
“Emily Olson did a great job filling the spot,” said Meghan O’Grady. “The back line was confident and knew they could do it.” 

“You can’t replace Sam Hoffman,” said Lynch. “But Emily Olson did a really good job at controlling the back. It was a good test for the back line.” 

With the win, the Mules (8-3-1, 3-1) recorded their sixth shutout of the season and matched their win total from all of last year.

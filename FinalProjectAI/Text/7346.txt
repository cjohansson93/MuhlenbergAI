Mule Vaulters Soar on Track and Field Opening Day
 Friday, May 2, 2014 - page 3







					 




The Muhlenberg women vaulted into the early lead at the Centennial Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

With three placewinners in the top six in the pole vault, the first event, the Mules scored 15 team points. Dickinson tied Muhlenberg
after the other completed event on the first day, the 10,000 meters, and although the first-place standing isn’t likely to hold up
through the course of the three-day meet, it was a great start for the Mules.

Freshman Claudia Theriault earned a silver medal to top her fourth-place finish at the CC indoor meet. She missed her first
attempt but came back to clear her next four.

Freshman Jacqueline Jones came in fifth, one spot ahead of sophomore Katrina Faust.

Junior Jacob Miller-Sobel (right) cleared a personal-best 12-11¾ to place fourth in the men’s pole vault and match his
indoor finish.

Senior Scott Reutter was in fourth place after the first half of the decathlon with 2,763 points. He had the top mark in the
long jump among the 10 competitors in the event.

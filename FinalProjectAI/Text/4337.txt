 Men's lacrosse

Liddic named first-team All-CC




A day after earning first-team Academic All-America honors, Muhlenberg mens basketball junior Spencer Liddic was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team for the second time in his career.

Liddic, a 2010 first-team selection, was a unanimous choice for the second time and one of only two such selections on this years squad.

The power forward currently leads the conference, and ranks in the top 35 in the country, in both scoring (20.4) and rebounding (9.8). He holds a 1.5 rebound-per-game advantage over the next closest CC player. 

Liddic registered the 1,000th point of his career during the Mules win over then-No. 19 Franklin & Marshall in January; he needed only 67 games to reach the milestone. Then in Muhlenbergs season finale against Ursinus, he scored his 509th point of the season to break the school single-season scoring mark that had stood for 40 years.

The junior captain scored in double figures in 23 of 24 games this season, and he scored at least 20 points 14 times. His 13 double-doubles are tied for 20th in the country, and he ranks in the top 15 in the CC in field-goal percentage (.513, 9th) and blocks (0.68, 13th).

Liddic tied for second on the team with 16 steals and ranked fifth on the squad with 38 assists. He currently sits in 15th place on Muhlenbergs career scoring list and is 16th in CC history in rebounds.

This is the third all-conference honor of Liddics career; he also earned honorable mention as a freshman. He is the 12th Muhlenberg player to be named first-team all-conference in back-to-back seasons, and the first to accomplish that feat since Mark Lesko did it three years in a row from 2000-02.

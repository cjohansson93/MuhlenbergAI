 Women’s Soccer Downed in OT






The Muhlenberg womens soccer team played a typically tight game against Moravian, losing 2-1 in overtime.

The Mules (5-5) took a 1-0 lead early in the second half on sophomore Meghan OGradys team-leading fifth goal of the season. Sophomore
Renee Dessimone (above) set up the goal by hustling to win a ball in the corner.

The Greyhounds (7-4-1) tied the score with 6:38 left in regulation and netted the winning goal 1:43 into overtime.

Muhlenberg and Moravian have played 16 games since 1994, with only one decided by more than one goal. Six of the last nine have been tied at the end of regulation.

Beating Moravian is something the Muhlenberg volleyball team could get used to. 

After going winless against the Greyhounds from 2000 to 2007, the Mules have now 




McQueen finished with 8 kills and a career-high 15 digs.



defeated their local rivals twice in the last two years. And this time, their win counted the most for their school.

Last season, Muhlenberg swept Moravian in a tournament, but the Greyhounds came back to win the regularly scheduled meeting, which counts for the Matte Award. In 2009, the volleyball team won an important Matte Award point for Muhlenberg.

Combined with the womens soccer loss earlier in the day, the 3-1 win by the volleyball team kept Muhlenberg ahead in the 2009-10 Matte Award standings. Muhlenberg leads the all-sport competition 3-1, with the next contests not until Nov. 14 (football and cross country).

The Mules (6-9) started slowly, falling into a 6-1 hole in the first set, but ran off the next five points to tie the score. They took their first lead at 8-7 and steadily pulled away to win, 25-19.

A longer run of points was the key to the second set. With sophomore Davi Gordon serving, Muhlenberg turned a 6-5 deficit into a 15-6 lead en route to a 25-16 victory. Gordon had six of her match-high 12 kills in only nine attempts in the second set.

After dropping the third set, 25-22, the Mules eliminated all drama by sprinting out to leads of 9-1 and 16-3. The 25-9 win marked the first time this season that Muhlenberg held an opponent to single digits (not counting fifth sets).

Muhlenberg hit .435 in the fourth set, with senior Phylicia Lee recording half of her 10 kills and sophomore Brooke McQueen notching three kills in five attempts. Freshman Liz Reese, in her first action of the season, put down a kill on match point.

Lee added 25 digs to her 10 kills. Senior Christina Cangelosi finished with 27 digs to move into fourth place on the programs all-time list with 1,243 career digs. By assisting on 38 kills, freshman Bryn Baker cracked the top 10 on the Mules career list, with 446 assists.

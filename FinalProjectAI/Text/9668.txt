New Application Due Date: Monday, February 28, 2022 Students Interested in Applying for Summer Grants:
The Faculty Development and Scholarship Committee will be accepting applications from students interested in doing research during the summer of 2022. These grants are intended for students who plan to engage in research or independent study that will lead to publication, presentation, exhibition, or performance. They are not granted for participation in formal course work, formal study abroad programs, or internships. The Dean of Academic Life anticipates being able to make up to seven such awards for the summer of 2022.  There are additional donor funded grants included in the same application (if applicable to students) and are listed below.

          Timothy A. Birch Student Summer Research Grant
  








Purpose
The purpose of the Timothy A. Birch Student Summer Research Grant is to encourage students from underrepresented groups (e.g., students who identify with underrepresented racial, gender, sexual, religious, or ability groups) to engage in scholarship, research, or creative activity which furthers their academic interests and results in publication, performance or exhibition. Students will follow the guidelines and requirements for the Dean of Academic Life Summer Research Grant Application. You should apply for the Deanâs Grant online and also check the box stating you want to apply for the Birch Grant.
Award
We will be awarding one grant per summer. The grant is for a $3,000 stipend for eight weeks of research, paid to the student through the regular College payroll process. The student receiving this award will receive free shared housing in the dorm for eight weeks. A room deposit is required. The student also earns one course unit of academic credit (tuition free) as an independent study. If the award is for a less than eight-week project, then the stipend, housing, and course credit are adjusted accordingly. We are planning to run the program on-campus in 2022 but plans may have to be adjusted due to concerns related to COVID-19. Students should consider how their research plans could be completed remotely if housing is not available or in person lab experiences are not an option due to COVID-19. If the College moves to remote learning during Summer 2022 and you cannot conduct your research off- campus, your award will be rescinded.
How to Apply
Complete the online grant application found online by 4 p.m. on Monday, February 28, 2022. Please start your online application early to ensure time for your faculty sponsor to complete it, before the deadline. The form will be forwarded to your faculty sponsor and then to Lori Flatto, Administrative Assistant to the Dean of Academic Life. Ms. Flatto will add a copy of your transcript to your application. The winner of the grant will be chosen by the Provost and/or Dean of Academic Life and will be notified in March.

To apply to the Deanâs Student Summer Research and Donor Grants, please read the guidelines before submitting your application.
Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a $3,000 stipend for eight weeks of research during the summer and one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost to the student. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with up to eight weeks of campus housing (based on double occupancy). Awardees also participate in the summer research community and present in the Celebration of Student Research and Scholarship poster session at the discretion of their faculty mentor. Students may not have other obligations (paid employment, course work, etc.) during the period of the grant. Students may not have more than eight weeks of summer research funded by the college per summer. In addition, the student is expected to be enrolled at Muhlenberg in Fall 2022.  Any student receiving an award must: (1) submit a short report no later than September 9, 2022 to Lori Flatto and (2) participate in the fall poster session.
Students who are interested in applying should use the online form (link) to apply. After you submit the form, please email Lori Flatto and let her know that you applied and who your faculty mentor is.
The proposal must include an abstract of the proposed work, a 3 to 5 page description of the project, and a letter of support from the faculty sponsor. The proposal is to be written by the student and should be reviewed by the faculty sponsor. The online application needs to be completed by Monday, February 28, 2022.  A copy of the student's transcript will be added to the application.
Students in all majors are eligible to apply. Representative projects include scientific research, photographic essays, choreography, and literary studies. Projects should be focused (one aspect of a writerâs work, the effect of light on plant defense mechanisms, etc.). Projects are intended to be student-initiated rather than faculty-initiated.
Please note: If you plan to do survey research or other research with human subjects, you will need Muhlenberg College Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Getting IRB approval can be a time-consuming process (especially if the project involves anyone under 18 years old) and must be started early.
Please also note: Any applicant for a summer research grant which would take place outside the U.S. border must meet with the Dean of Global Education to complete additional required forms.  Such students will also be required to purchase international health and travel insurance.

SIX WOMENS SOCCER PLAYERS NAMED ALL-CC 



Thanks to its remarkable 9-1 run in the Centennial Conference, six members of the Muhlenberg womens soccer team earned All-CC honors, its highest total since 2001.

Senior Kasey Hacker was the lone first teamer, receiving the honor for the second straight year. Hacker (left) has scored five goals, three of which were game winners, and two assists from the center midfield. She leads all active Mules in career goals (21) and points (56), ranking in the top nine in Muhlenberg history in both. She is just the fifth Mule to be named first-team All-CC in consecutive years.

Four Mules were named to the second team, including the entire starting front line. Senior Christina OGrady, sophomores Meghan OGrady and Nicolette Miller and freshman Maggie Neary all received the honor.

Christina OGrady was named to the second team for the fourth straight year. She has three goals and four assists on the season and is the Mules active leader in career assists (15). Her younger sister, Meghan, leads Muhlenberg with eight goals and 18 points. She ranks fifth in the CC in goals per game (0.47) and sixth in points per game (1.06).

Miller has started all 18 games, netting four goals and three assists. Neary stepped in at center back in the second game of the season, helping the Mules post eight shutouts so far this season. She also has two assists from the back in her rookie campaign.

Sophomore goalkeeper Michele Toher received honorable mention. She has posted a 1.37 goals-against average and .744 save percentage and recorded six shutouts in her first full season as a starter.

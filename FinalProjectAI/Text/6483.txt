Men's Soccer Comes Back on Pair of Antonini Goals

Volleyball Drops Match to Swarthmore

 The upset-minded Muhlenberg volleyball team won the first set, but Swarthmore (15-4, 6-2) came back to take the next three and hand the Mules a Centennial Conference loss at home.

Muhlenberg (15-9, 3-5) needs to win its remaining two CC matches to have any chance at making the playoffs. The key match is Saturday’s home finale against Gettysburg. Although the Bullets are 5-2, they still have to play CC front-runners Johns Hopkins and Franklin & Marshall. If the Mules win on Saturday (and next Saturday at Ursinus), there is a possibility of a tie at 5-5 for the final playoff spot, with Washington and Dickinson also in the mix.

Freshman Sarah Weyhmuller led the attack with 11 kills against the Garnet, while sophomore Holly Hynson had 10 in only 23 attempts. Junior Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare hit .429 in 14 attempts.

Sophomore Nikki Dickson recorded 31 assists, six kills and six digs.

There are some unfamiliar names in the box score for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer game against William Paterson. And one very familiar one.


Senior Cody Antonini scored both goals as the Mules came back from a 1-0 halftime deficit to win, 2-1, in a game added to the schedule a few weeks ago.

It was the third multiple-goal game of the season for Antonini, who has been involved in 10 of the last 12 goals scored by Muhlenberg (9-4). He has 12 goals for the season and 45 for his career.

In the 69th minute, sophomore Bryan Attanasio took a free kick from the near right flank, and when the ball reached Antonini he clipped it backwards with his heel for the tying goal.

Less than a minute-and-a-half later, sophomore Joe Adams sent a ball towards the near post on a throwin from the right sideline. The Pioneer goalkeeper missed when he charged out to eliminate the threat, and the ball squeezed through to Antonini, who was waiting inside the six to tap it in.

The assists were the first career points for both Attanasio (pictured) and Adams.

Sophomore Danny Pinto earned the win in goal in his first career start, making three saves.

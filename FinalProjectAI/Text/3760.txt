young legs carry cross country teams




In a meet that combined long and short, the Muhlenberg cross country teams combined youth and experience.

The Mule men tied for eighth and the women finished 14th at the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational, which consisted of a short race (4K) and a long race (6K for women and 8K for men) for each gender.

Of the four races, the first Muhlenberg finisher in three was a freshman: Bobby McGetrick (left) in the men's 8K, Ramzy Burns in the women's 6K and Nicole Cronin in the women's 4K. 

Crashing the youths' party was senior Bobby Torphy, who paced all Mules in the men's 4K, finishing 10th overall out of 211 runners in the most popular of the four runs.

Junior William Lowery was only four places behind McGetrick's 47th in the 8K, with freshman Charlie Kline coming in 59th.

The team scores combined the places of the top three runners in both the long- and short-course runs. Of the seven teams that finished ahead of the Muhlenberg men, three (Lock Haven, Shippensburg and Millersville) are from Division II, two (Dickinson and New York University) are nationally ranked and the other two (Messiah and Christopher Newport) are regionally ranked. Messiah is ninth in the Mideast, one spot ahead of Muhlenberg.

Cronin's 15th-place finish was tops for the women, while Burns came in 53rd. The women's team was running short-handed due to the holiday.

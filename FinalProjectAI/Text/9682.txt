Brain Camp @ Muhlenberg
Brain Camp is a residential science camp for motivated, energetic high school students who are interested in the wonders of the brain.
Over the course of one week, campers live on campus in supervised student housing, explore the inner workings of the nervous system, participate in hands-on laboratory exercises, work closely with Muhlenberg College neuroscience faculty and students, and direct their own research project.
Please check back for information on future Brian Camp sessions!

volleyball stays in hunt


Christina Cangelosi may go by the nickname “Cani,” but her ability to prevent the other team from scoring points is uncanny.

The senior moved closer to the school record 



Cangelosi entered the week 23rd in Division III in digs per set. Her 451 digs rank sixth on the Mules’ single-season list.



for career digs as the Muhlenberg volleyball team remained in the chase for a Centennial Conference playoff berth with a 3-1
win at Bryn Mawr.

Cangelosi recorded a match-high 26 digs to move into second place on the Mules’ all-time list with 1,363. She is on pace to surpass the school record of 1,385
either Saturday at Franklin & Marshall or Wednesday at home against Ursinus.

Those matches are of utmost importance for the Mules (9-11, 4-3), who are tied for fifth in the CC with three matches to go in the regular season. Muhlenberg will have
to finish strong, as it lost to the team it is tied with (McDaniel) and has to face two teams (7-1 Franklin & Marshall and 5-2 Gettysburg) it trails in the standings.

The Mules breezed to a 25-6 win in the first set against the Owls (8-13, 0-7), hitting .435 on 11 kills in 23 attempts. Bryn Mawr came back to capture the second set, but
Muhlenberg secured its fifth win in seven matches by taking the final two sets.

Seniors Phylicia Lee (14 kills, 13 digs) and Brittany Williams (10 kills, 11 digs) both recorded double-doubles, and freshman Jennifer Seeba contributed 
8 kills in 17 attempts to go along with 6 blocks.

No relation to Bryn Mawr, freshman Bryn Baker had 39 assists.

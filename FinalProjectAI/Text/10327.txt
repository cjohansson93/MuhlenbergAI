"Pandemic: Response, Resilience, Reflection" continues to explore the ethical questions and challenges that have arisen or have been exacerbated by the continued impact of COVID-19.


	 Thursday, January 27, 2022  09:35 AM


"Pandemic: Response, Resilience, Reflection" explores some of the ethical questions that arise when we pause to think about the global pandemic including: What lessons can be learned from the scientific collaboration on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines? From receiving a vaccine to wearing masks, how has the pandemic exposed the limits and obligations of individual and collective ethical behavior? How should we respond to the ways in which the pandemic has had disparate impacts based on race and class? How do we think about the rationing of care when health systems get overwhelmed?

Artists Quarantining with Their WorkNovember 17 â February 3, 2022Martin Art Gallery Exhibit
Artists Quarantine With Their Art Collections began as a series of articles Stephen organized and edited for the arts journal Hyperallergic.com. The project looks at the ways global cataclysm can reshape meaning in artworks that predate it, and how the experience of a specific collective hardship can influence the significance we extract from (or project onto) artworksâeven those we thought we knew well. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Stephen asked his fellow artists: In the context of rampant disease, do you look at your personal collection differently now and which works in particular? Is there one that especially resonates with you at this weird, frightening moment? And does it take on new meaning?
The panel discussion, scheduled to be moderated by guest curator, Stephen Maine, was canceled due to COVID-19.
 
Documentary 5B Discussion with the Film ProducersFriday, February 25, 2022, at 2 p.m.Zoom information to follow
5B is the inspirational story of everyday heroes, nurses and caregivers who took extraordinary action to comfort, protect and care for the patients of the first AIDS ward unit in the United States. 5B is stirringly told through first-person testimony of these nurses and caregivers who built Ward 5B in 1983 at San Francisco General Hospital, their patients, loved ones and staff who volunteered to create care practices based in humanity and holistic well-being during a time of great uncertainty. The result is an uplifting yet candid and bittersweet monument to a pivotal moment in American history and a celebration of quiet heroes, nurses and caregivers worthy of renewed recognition.
In advance of the discussion with filmmakers, the film can be viewed online.

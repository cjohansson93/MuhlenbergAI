Curriculum
The study of physics enables students to develop the important skills of deductive and analytical reasoning. It provides an understanding of natural phenomena and demands that the student be able to express an intuitive model of nature in mathematical terms. In short, the study of physics is the study of problem-solving. The skills developed help to prepare the graduate for the ever-changing technical world in which we live and for life in general.

women’s lacrosse, men’s tennis suffer CC losses


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team fell at fourth-ranked Franklin & Marshall, 17-4.

The Mules (7-5, 2-4) trailed only 3-1 with less than 10 minutes to play in the first half, but the Diplomats (10-1, 6-0) widened
their lead to 6-2 at the break, then scored the first four goals of the second half. Muhlenberg netted two of the next three to close to within 11-4,
but F&M, the defending national champion, ran off six straight goals to end the game, including three in the last 30 seconds.

Junior Danielle Rosen scored two of the Mules’ four goals.

In spite of the loss, Muhlenberg is still in the Centennial Conference playoff hunt, but the Mules will likely need to win their final three regular-season
games against Swarthmore, Ursinus and Washington.

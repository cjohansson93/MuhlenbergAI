Mules Shut Out Geneva


It’s amazing what a little pitching and defense can do.

A few hours after a sloppy 11-2 loss to 18th-ranked Muskingum, the Muhlenberg softball team rebounded to shut out Geneva, 2-0.

Freshman Alyssa Bruckner and junior Lara Kestenbaum combined on the four-hit shutout, with Bruckner working out of two big jams to earn her first career win. She struck out a batter with runners on second and third and one out in the second, then got two ground balls to escape a bases-loaded, nobody-out situation in the fourth.

Kestenbaum retired the last five batters, fanning two, to earn the save.

The Mules (2-4) scored both of their runs in the first inning on a two-run double by freshman Jess Kasza, who also hit a two-bagger in the Muskingum game.

team took a step in the right direction.

Two days after a disappointing 20-4 loss to Gettysburg, the Mules came back to knock off Gwynedd-Mercy, 18-6, in the last of their two games in Florida.

“We really changed it from the last game,” said junior co-captain Marguerite Farrell, who recorded four ground balls. “Today’s game we connected better all over the field.”

The defense in particular was well-connected, keeping the Griffins off the scoreboard for more than 23 minutes. Ahead only 5-3 with 9:52 left in the first half, Muhlenberg reeled off the next nine goals, including two in the final minute of the first half, to break the game open.

Three players – senior Taylor Armstrong, junior Ruth Morrongiello and freshman Rachael Goldstein – notched hat tricks, with Armstrong adding a pair of assists. Sophomore Amanda McGovern also scored five points, on two goals and three assists.

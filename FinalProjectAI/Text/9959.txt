Eduardo Azzati Voice
EducationB.M., Juan JosÃ© Castro State Conservatory of MusicM.M., Westminster Choir CollegeEduardo Azzati is a versatile musician with 30 years of experience as voice instructor, vocal coach, choral and instrumental conductor, singer, music educator and keyboardist.
During the late 80âs and 90âs he gained popularity as a soloist and choral conductor in his homeland, Argentina, where he directed many choral and orchestral ensembles and sang with important orchestras, including the National Symphony Orchestra.
During the 10-year period between 1987 and 1997, while still in Argentina, Mr. Azzati held many positions as a choral director in many different settings, including Elementary, Middle and High School, church and community.  Among other positions Mr. Azzati was the Associate Conductor of the award-winning National Youth Choir of Argentina, Director of Choral Activities and Conductor of the award-winning choirs at the K-12 St. Agnes School, Director of Choral Activities and Conductor at the K-12 St. Andrew's School, Artistic Director and Conductor of Kantus, a college-age youth community chorus, and Director of the Chorale de LâAlliance FranÃ§aise of MartÃ­nez.
As a solo singer Mr. Azzati has performed many bass/baritone solo roles in most of the great sacred choral-orchestral works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Mendelssohn, etc. as well as the art songs of the German, French, British, American and Spanish repertoires.  He also feels a strong connection with the American Music Theater genre and has taught it for decades.
Mr. Azzati has thirty years of experience teaching voice in the private studio setting as well as the collegial level.  His teaching philosophy and approach are founded on the anatomical and physiological principles and mechanics of voice function and their specific application to the different music genres and styles.  Heâs a firm believer in the old Italian adage âsi canta come si parlaâ (âwe sing like we speakâ), which has a foundation on speech and language leading the act of singing.  Since 1998 Mr. Azzati has been on the music faculty at Moravian College in Bethlehem, PA, where he was the recipient of the 2005 T. Edgar Shields Prize for "excellence in studio teaching, contributions to music scholarship and participation in professional musical activities, and a quality relationship to music students."  As a Moravian College Artist-Lecturer in Voice and Conducting he teaches applied voice, voice-related courses and conducting on a as-needed basis, and directs the Moravian College Women's Chorus.  He is also currently a Part-Time Lecturer in Voice at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA.
Since 1999 Mr. Azzati has been the Director of Music at Yardley United Methodist Church, in Yardley, PA, where he the choirs (mostly from the keyboard), accompanies solo singers and instrumentalists as well as congregational singing and provides keyboard music for all worship services.
He is also the Chorus Master of the Allentown Symphony Chorus and has prepared the chorus for performances of Mozart Requiem, Beethoven 9th Symphony, Orff Carmina Burana and Mahler 2nd (Resurrection) Symphony and other works.
Mr. Azzati holds a Bachelorâs Degree in music with a specialization in conducting from Juan JosÃ© Castro State Conservatory of Music, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a Master's Degree in Voice Performance and Pedagogy from Westminster Choir College of Rider University, Princeton, NJ.
He is the co-founder, 2-term past president and current member of the Board of Directors of the Lehigh Valley Chapter of the National Association of Teachers of Singing.
Mr. Azzati resides in Bethlehem with his wife Carole Burkhardt, also a singer and music educator, his three children, Mica, Lukas and Pablo and their short-haired German pointer/brown Lab mix, Hershey.

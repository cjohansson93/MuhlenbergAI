men’s lacrosse drops cc opener in 2ot


With the ball rolling on the ground behind the cage, the members of the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team were not 




The goal by Watkins was his sixth of the season.



sure why the Franklin & Marshall bench had just stormed the field.

The Mules figured the Diplomat shot must have sailed 
wide; otherwise it wouldve been in the goal. But after checking the cage, the officials ruled the ball actually broke through the side of the net and was indeed a goal. 

And with that simple, and correct, ruling, the Mules lost a 6-5 heartbreaker in double overtime in the Centennial Conference opener for both teams. 

It was the third straight time the teams played a multiple-overtime game in Lancaster. Muhlenberg won in triple overtime in 2008, and F&M prevailed in triple OT last year.

Muhlenberg (2-4, 0-1) got on the board first when junior Clint Watkins caught a pass from sophomore Jack Reilly in traffic and one-timed it into the back of the net with 4:49 to play in the first quarter.

The Diplomats (5-1, 1-0) responded with back-to-back goals in the second quarter and appeared to be headed to the locker room with the lead until Reilly, once again playing behind the cage, rifled a pass to senior Brent Siebold, who caught and shot in one motion to retie the game with 7.7 seconds to play before halftime.

F&M went back in front less than four 



Women’s Lax Also Falls at F&M


The Muhlenberg women's lacrosse team opened Centennial Conference play with an 11-4 loss at fourth-ranked Franklin & Marshall.

The Mules, who averaged 14.4 goals in their first five games, were held to only 13 shots for the game and just one first-half goal.

Muhlenberg's defense, for its part, held the Diplomats to 11 goals, five fewer than they scored in any meeting between the two teams from
2000 to 2010. Sophomore Alexandra Franck led the defense with seven ground balls.

minutes into the second half, but the Mules pulled even a little more than a minute later on a heads-up, or rather foots-up, play by senior Zachary Armstrong.

Making a run at the net on a fast break, Armstrong lost control of the ball 
when his stick was checked. With the ball rolling on the ground, Armstrong showed his inner 




Michael Carpetto and the Muhlenberg defense held the Diplomats, who came in averaging 12.40 goals per game, to less than half their average.



Pelé and kicked it past the Diplomat defenders and into the net.

The F&M bench roared in disapproval, but the ref just responded, Thats legal.

However, the Mule celebration was short lived as the Diplomats scored consecutive goals to open up the only two-goal lead of the game.

But with a little more than minute to play in the quarter, Reilly made a charge at the net from behind the cage. After beating his defender, Reilly 
leapt from just outside the crease and shot while in midair. The ball flew over the goalies left shoulder to make it a one-goal game entering the fourth quarter.

Despite being outshot 12-5 in the final quarter, the Mule defense kept F&M off the board. Senior Mike Horowitz made four of his 17 saves in the fourth and held the Diplomats scoreless for a stretch of almost 24 minutes.

But the Mules still trailed when senior Andy Curley delivered a punishing check and forced a turnover with 4:40 to play.

The Mules got the ball to Siebold, who knifed through the defense and scored from almost point-blank range, tying the game for the fourth time and sending it to overtime. 

The two teams traded scoring opportunities in the extra sessions before F&M struck with 1:30 left in the second extra period.

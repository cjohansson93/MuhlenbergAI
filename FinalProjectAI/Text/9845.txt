Our students areâ¦

Creative â They come to the table with ideas informed by their own experiences and the wide-ranging education they achieve at Muhlenberg. They bring those ideas to the studio and the rehearsal hall, and they create truly unique artistic expressions.
Collaborative â Our students work closely with faculty, guest artists, and each other to help bring each other's vision to fruition.
Diverse â Theatre & Dance students hail from all over the country, with backgrounds and experiences as diverse as the world around them.
Thoughtful â Muhlenberg's Theatre Program attracts students who want to get serious about their studies â both in the studio and in the classroom. They are encouraged to reflect on what they've learned in Muhlenberg's world-class liberal arts curriculum, and they bring those reflections to their work as artists.
Talented â We have assembled a tremendous community of actors, designers, technicians, directors, playwrights, and scholars, who work together to create world-class performances.

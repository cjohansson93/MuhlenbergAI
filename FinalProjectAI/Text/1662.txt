Muhlenberg College Participates In The Great American Smokeout!



On Thursday, November 17, 2005 Muhlenberg College will participate in the 29 th Annual Great American Smokeout.


	 Monday, November 14, 2005  01:59 PM

Students enrolled in the College’s Health Communication class are encouraging students, faculty and staff to quit smoking for the day and will be in Seeger ’s Union to provide information and answer questions on social smoking, second hand smoke, the physical effects of smoking, and information on Quit Smart, a treatment program that is now offered on our campus. Activities include:


Already-existing smoke free zones will be marked out in front of the Seeger ’s Union and in Parent’s Plaza.
The Coalition for a Smoke-Free Valley will provide carbon monoxide testing for all students, faculty and staff.
Health Communication students are “making” cigarettes and “showing” the impact of smoking over time on the body and appearance. Bring your curiosity, imagination and courage along with you to view the displays.
Students are encouraged to sign a one-day, non-smoking pledge, and names will be entered into a raffle to win gift certificates later in the evening.
The Liberty Street Tavern (23 rd and Liberty Streets) will be smoke free from 7 p.m. – 11 p.m. (21 and older only after 9 PM), with cigarettes checked in at the door! Enjoy $1 slices all evening and $2 off any pitcher in a comfortable, smoke-free environment.

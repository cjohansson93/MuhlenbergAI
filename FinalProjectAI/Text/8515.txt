Ron Chernow is one of the most distinguished commentators on politics, business and finance in America today. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has hailed him as “one of the pre-eminent biographers of his generation” and Fortune called him “America’s best business biographer.” His first book, The House of Morgan, won the National Book Award as the best nonfiction book of 1990 and is considered a modern classic. The Modern Library Board voted it one of the 100 best nonfiction books published in the twentieth century. His second book, The Warburgs, won the prestigious George S. Eccles Prize for the best business book of 1993 and was cited by the American Library Association as one of the year’s ten best works. His 1998 biography of John D. Rockefeller, entitled Titan, was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award for biography and remained on The New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks. Both the Times and Time magazine voted it one of the 10 best books of the year, while The Timesof London praised it as “one of the great American biographies.”
His biography of Alexander Hamilton was published in April 2004. Excerpted by Business Week and chosen as the main selection of both The Book-of-the-Month Club and the History Book Club, the book spent three months on the New York Times bestseller list and was the first recipient of the George Washington Book Prize for the year’s best book about the founding era. It was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in biography.Chernow’s long-awaited biography of George Washington was the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club as well as the History and Military Book Clubs.

In March 2011, the New-York Historical Society gave the book the coveted American History Book Prize for the best book about American history published in 2010, endowing Chernow with the honorary title of American Historian Laureate. In May of that year, Washington was honored with the Pulitzer Prize in Biography, the highest honor reserved for a writer in that field.A frequent contributor to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, Chernow is a familiar figure on national radio and television shows and has appeared in numerous documentaries.

Dr. Carson D. Schneck received a B.S. degree from Muhlenberg College in 1955 and M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Temple University in 1959 and 1965. He served on the faculty of Temple Medical School from 1960-2012 with joint appointments in the departments of anatomy and diagnostic imaging. He was elected to the AOA Honorary Medical Fraternity in his junior year in medical school.
As a faculty member, Schneck received 18 Golden Apple Teaching awards, four Medical Yearbook dedications, four Sowell Teaching awards and was selected by 28 medical classes to be a hooder at their graduations. In 1988, he received the Temple Great Teachers award in its inaugural year and the AOA-AAMC Distinguished Basic Science Teacher award as the first recipient of this national award. He also received the Temple Medical Alumni Achievement award and the Stauffer award for Distinguished Service to Temple University. The anatomy lab in the new Medical School Building was dedicated to and largely designed by Schneck. Upon his faculty appointment, in addition to teaching in first year anatomy courses, Schneck initiated PGME and CME clinical anatomy courses in essentially all of the clinical departments and senior medical student elective courses in all of the medical specialties
Even though medical basic courses were classically lecture/lab courses, because Schneck had been impressed by the Socratic dialogue style of teaching of philosophy Professor Russell Stine at Muhlenberg College, when he was appointed director of the gross anatomy course in 1969, the anatomy department decided to eliminate all lectures and replace them with clinical problem solving conferences that immediately followed the dissected anatomy. Schneck wrote anatomy notes containing considerable clinical applications of the anatomy. Actual clinical cases were selected from the Diagnostic Imaging library and scripted Power Point presentations of the history, physical, imaging and laboratory findings were shown and the students were all called on individually in problem-solving conference to use their just learned anatomy to solve real clinical problems at the very beginning of their medical education. Temple medical students have consistently evaluated the gross anatomy course as the best basic science course for the past 40 years.
In research, Schneck published 30 peer reviewed articles in clinical journals mostly involving MRI imaging of musculoskeletal pathology. He wrote 22 books, monographs and chapters on similar topics. He also produced 18 hours of videotape dissection directions and 20 hours of commercially marketed videotapes that correlated sectional anatomy of the entire body with CT and ultrasound images.

women’s lax warms up to new season


The Super Bowl MVP may get to tell the cameras, “I’m going to Disney World!”, but after its season-opening victory, 
the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team actually will be going to Disney World.

And after a record-setting 19-7 win over Kean that came in freezing temperatures, the trip to sunny Orlando can’t come a moment too soon.

“We never try to let the weather affect us,” said 




McGovern first scored eight points in a game against Bryn Mawr last year. She is one point short of 150 for her career.




junior Danielle Rosen. “Your fingers may get cold, but you’ve still got to give it your all for 60 minutes out there.”

The Mules (1-0) certainly gave it their all, tying the school record for most goals scored in a half, 15, in the first – the exact same number they put up against 
Kean (0-1) last season. Muhlenberg also finished with 15 assists, one off 




Scarrone’s goal made it 6-0 with 18:13 left in the first half, and 16 seconds later Rosen made scored. The two goals were part of a five-goal blitz in a span of
4:22.





the school record set in 2008, and pushed its non-conference winning streak to 27 games.

“We all connected really well,” commented Rosen. “We spread it out wide, took our time with the ball and tried to make the right pass. 
We kept the ball on offense and prevented their attack.”

Rosen was one of the many stars of the Mules’ attack, scoring a whopping five goals and three assists in the first half alone. She added an assist less than 
three minutes into the second for her ninth point, a new career high and tied for the third-most ever by a Mule in a game.

Senior Amanda McGovern tallied three goals and two assists in the record-tying half and finished with five and three for the game, tying her career high of 
eight points. Sophomore Angela Napoletano and classmate Kelsey Elmer both scored twice in the period.

The Mules led 15-1 at halftime and 19-1 with 15:20 left in the game, allowing several newcomers to see their first action. 
They took advantage; freshmen Molly Davin and Alex Bellini both scored their first career goals, and classmate Alexandra Gabriele recorded her 
first career point on one of Rosen’s goals. 

Another freshman, Alexandra Franck, made an impressive debut on defense, causing a game-high five turnovers and scooping up a game-high four ground balls.

Seniors Alyssa Bascelli (two goals) and Danielle Scarrone also found the back of the net for Muhlenberg.

Despite the all-around fantastic season opener, the Mules are now more than ready to leave the cold for the warmth of Disney.

Said Rosen, “What’s better than warm weather and meeting Mickey Mouse?”

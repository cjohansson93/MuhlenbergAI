Kreider Named CC Defensive Player of the Week
 Monday, March 5, 2012 - page 2







					 




The first lacrosse game she ever played in couldn’t have gone much better for Tiffany Kreider.

A converted field hockey player, Kreider was named Centennial Conference defensive player of the week after making nine saves in her debut as a lacrosse goalie.
The junior stopped all three free-position shots she faced as Muhlenberg opened its season with a 15-3 win against Widener.

The three goals were the second-fewest allowed by the Mules in their first game of the season; the 2003 squad started with a 20-1 win against Moravian.

Kreider’s three goals allowed were one short of the school record for a goalie making her first career start.

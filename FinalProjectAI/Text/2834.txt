women’s basketball wins in laugher


With about 3:20 left in the first half of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball game against Swarthmore, sophomore Alexandra Chili shot a three-pointer from the wing that bounced off the front of the rim and caromed up over the backboard. As the ball rattled around behind the backboard before falling to the floor, Chili bowed her head and laughed.

It was that kind of game for the Mules. Chili’s misfire, which came with the score 42-13,  was one of few 




McKeon went over 900 points for her career with 11 against Swarthmore.



mistakes Muhlenberg made in an impressive first-half performance.

The Mules shot 61.3 percent from the field and 
committed just five turnovers in the first 20 minutes, opening up a 46-20 lead and going on to win, 71-43,

The victory kept Muhlenberg (16-3, 13-2), ranked fifth in the region 




Sophomore Kimberly Mui scored four points and pulled down five rebounds in 12 minutes of playing time.



in the first NCAA rankings of the season, in a virtual tie with McDaniel and Gettysburg, who also won, atop the Centennial Conference standings.
Swarthmore (9-12, 6-10) played close games with the other 
two leaders, splitting with McDaniel and losing by three points to Gettysburg twice.

Chili scored 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the first half and finished with 26. She hit four three-pointers to move into second place on the program’s career list with 159 for her career. Junior Kelly McKeon added 11 points and senior Alexis Bates a season-high seven as part of a balanced attack that featured 11 players in the scoring column.

Ahead only 9-7 with 3:18 played, the Mules kicked off a 27-2 run with the second of senior Kaitlyn O’Malley’s back-to-back three-pointers. The blitz made the score 36-9 with just under six minutes to play in the half.

“I don’t know if we can play any better than that,” said freshman Kate Clawson, who made her first career start. “I didn’t even know that we were winning by that much until I looked up at the scoreboard.”

It was the second game in a row Muhlenberg came out on fire following its upset loss at Johns Hopkins. On Monday, the Mules opened up a 28-12 lead en route to a 36-point win against Dickinson.

“I think the Hopkins game made us realize that we’re not going to win every game if we don’t play hard,” noted Clawson. “If definitely helped us push our way at the start of the game.”

Clawson got a break at the start of the game when the Garnet’s 6-5 center didn’t take the opening jump. The 5-11 Clawson won the jump ball and settled in nicely, contributing two points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal to the win.

“I was just trying to stay clam,” she said. “Anything I can do to help our team is what I’m trying to do anyway.”

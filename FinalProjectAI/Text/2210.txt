Jenn Haltman  Class of 2004 Dual Major in Dance and Theatre
Freelance Casting Director





Right after graduation, I moved to New York and took a position as a casting and production intern at the soap opera Guiding Light. Working in that office showed me that I had a deep interest in casting. From there I was accepted for a casting internship at New York Theatre Workshop, an Off-Broadway company in the East Village, where I moved from intern to receptionist, and eventually to casting associate. In that role I got to work on a variety of exciting plays, workshops, and readings by some of the field's most innovative artists, including Ivo van Hove, Alex Timbers, Doug Hughes, Jessica Blank, and Erik Jensen. My work with the casting director, Jack Doulin, allowed me also to work on freelance projects with such companies as Pig Iron Theatre Company, Page 73 Productions, Soho Rep, and New York Stage and Film. I have since transitioned out of New York Theatre Workshop but am continuing to pursue casting opportunities, as well as being recently appointed Associate Artistic Director of Nora's Playhouse, a fledgling Brooklyn-based theatre company committed to serving female artists.
My education at Muhlenberg greatly prepared me for the work I am doing now. In addition to learning about the classics, we also delved into influential Off- and Off-Off-Broadway productions that helped me identify and refine my aesthetic. Some of my most memorable post-college professional experiences include meeting and working with people who I learned about in Contemporary Drama Class. Who knew that after studying Moises Kaufman he would then become a colleague? Having such a varied education allowed me to participate in sophisticated conversations about theatre with professionals and be able to hold my own. I credit my professors with opening us up to the different possibilities of what theatre can be. As Associate Artistic Director, I am striving to champion and nurture female voices with a unique point of view to help us all learn about the human experience through theatre, which is such a powerful tool.

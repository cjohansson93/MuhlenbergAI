track quartet an all-america team



Hurdles isn’t normally one of the four events in the distance medley relay, but a little bit of hurdling helped a Muhlenberg foursome make history.

The Mule distance medley relay team of senior Stuart Udis, freshman Peter Rice, sophomore Bobby Torphy and senior David Chorney earned All-America honors by finishing fourth at the NCAA Championships, hosted by Rose-Hulman.

The finish is the highest ever for a Muhlenberg relay team at the national meet, one place better than the 2003 DMR team. 

Rice was running his 400 leg when an Allegheny runner in front of him fell down on the track. Rice did an excellent job avoiding going down himself, hurdling over the Allegheny runner to keep the Muhlenberg team in the race.

Chorney ran a smart final leg. With two teams (Wis.-Oshkosh and Wis.-La Crosse) well ahead of the field, Chorney stayed with a pack of about seven other schools until he made his move with two laps to go. His split of 4:11 brought the Mules across the finish line in fourth place with a time of 10:04.78.

Neither of the two Muhlenberg women at the national meet placed, but the performances of both were encouraging. With both being juniors, they hope to use the 2009 meet as a learning experience and return to the NCAAs in 2010.

Jennifer Lynch ran her second-fastest mile of the year, and pole vaulter Alex Faust narrowly missed in two attempts at 12 feet, which would have placed.

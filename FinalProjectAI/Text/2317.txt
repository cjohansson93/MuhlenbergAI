America Reads, Reading Rocks and the Office of Community Engagement are co-sponsoring a book drive to benefit students at Jefferson, Union Terrace and Roosevelt Elementary Schools within the Allentown School District.
The book drive will run from Friday, November 22nd-Tuesday December 3rd.  The books donated can be either new or used and appropriate for students in kindergarten to 5th grade. Collection bins are located in Seegers Union (near the Information Desk and in the Student Life Suite), the library, Life Sports Center, and the Multicultural Center.  These books will benefit many children in our local community. Please consider supporting the Allentown School District. If you have any questions/concerns, please contact Alexandra Fillis '14, Jen Freed '15 or Sabina Muccigrosso '16. Thank you in advance for your participation and support!

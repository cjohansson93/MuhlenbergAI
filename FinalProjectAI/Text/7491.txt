Baseball Sweeps Gallaudet in Opening Doubleheader
 Sunday, February 23, 2014







					 



The Muhlenberg baseball team opened the 2014 season with a doubleheader sweep at Gallaudet, winning the first game, 7-3, and the nightcap, 13-5.


Senior John Scuderi broke open a tight game in the opener with a two-run single and hit his third career home run in the second game.

The Mules trailed, 2-0, in Game 1 before scoring three runs in the fourth on two-out RBI singles by junior Danny Usewick, senior Tyler Latrenta and junior Jimmy Cody.

The Bison tied the score in the bottom of the inning, but Muhlenberg plated three more in the fifth. After the first two runners singled to start the inning, senior Nick Kennedy dropped down a bunt that was thrown away, allowing one run to score. Following a walk that loaded the bases, Scuderi delivered a single up the middle  to extend the lead to 6-3.

Scuderi walked leading off the seventh and scored an insurance run on a wild pitch.


Junior Christian Ferlan (right) scattered five hits over five innings to pick up the win. After two hit batters came around to score in the first, Ferlan allowed only one unearned run for the rest of his outing, helped out by a defense that turned two double plays.

Junior Phillip Balseca tossed the final two innings to earn his second career save. He struck out three, including the final two batters of the game with the tying run on deck.

The Mules didn’t need to come back in Game 2, bolting out to an 11-0 lead with five runs in the second and six in the third. Junior Nick Plinio (left) opened the first big inning with a double and capped the second one with another two-bagger.

Usewick delivered an RBI single in each inning, and Cody had the biggest blow, a two-out, bases-clearing triple in the third.

Scuderi led off the fourth with a homer to add to the big lead. The support was more than enough for junior Matthew Lawsky, who worked the first five innings to earn the win.

Muhlenberg drew 18 walks in 14 innings in the two games. Plinio reached base in all four plate appearances in the second game, and freshman John Icaza reached in the first three times to bat in his career and in five of eight plate appearances in the twinbill.

We are sorry to report that this event has been postponed. We hope to reschedule our speaker's visit for the Fall 2020 semester.
"A Conversation with New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet: Journalismâs Role in Democracy, the Fight for the First Amendment and the Pursuit of Truth in the 2020 Election and Society" was scheduled to take place on Thursday, April 16.
New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet began his tenure as editor in May 2014 after earlier roles as managing editor and Washington bureau chief. His career includes appointments as a reporter and editor for The New York Times; as managing editor and editor of the Los Angeles Times; and as a reporter with the Times-Picayune (New Orleans) and the Chicago Tribune, where he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on corruption in the Chicago City Council.
The conversation with Baquet will be facilitated by Professor of Political Science Christopher Borick. Baquetâs visit will include a classroom discussion with students on the First Amendment, journalism and truth in media and public opinion.
Baquet has been a staunch defender of the First Amendment and a news media under increasing attack. Defense of press rights has a long history at The Times, which in 1964 took this battle to the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark Times v. Sullivan case, in which the newspaper successfully argued against attempts by public figures and government from using libel laws to intimidate journalists.
This event will be sponsored by the media & communication and political science departments at Muhlenberg College and is supported by Muhlenberg College, PBS39 and the Lehigh Valley Community Foundation.

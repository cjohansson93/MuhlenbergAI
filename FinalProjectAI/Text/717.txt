 Justin Buchbinder Portrayal of Insanity: The Making of MisconductOurs is a culture of questions. Unfortunately, it is also a culture of quick answers. My answer to all the questions? Misconduct. This presentation is about a video story of a boy posthumously diagnosed with Conduct Disorder that I created in Dr. Tafler's Video Production course. Using the genre of a psychological mystery/drama, I tried my best to show that just because we have an answer doesn't mean it's the 'right' one, assuming that a right answer even exists. I will discuss my process of research, shooting and editing to convey an emotional viewpoint from a man that our culture has already turned its back on. After explaining my artistic and mental exploration, I will show selected excerpts of my film.

It wasn’t quite strawberries and cream, but breakfast at Muhlenberg was definitely sweet for the men’s tennis team, especially the seniors.

In a match that was moved up to 10 a.m. because of a threat of rain, the Mules took the middle four singles matches and one in doubles to beat Ursinus on Senior Day, 5-4. It was Mules’ eighth straight victory over the Bears (12-10, 1-8) and gave them a win in their Centennial Conference finale for the fourth year in a row.

After classmates Jordan Rutt, Andrew Brod and Robert Buesser were honored during a pre-match ceremony, Brod helped 




Brod’s doubles win was his third of the dual season, tying his career high set last year. 




the Mules (2-9, 2-7) earn their first point of the day, teaming with sophomore Ben Berkowitz for an 8-6 win at No. 3 doubles.


While the seniors were the focus of the day, it was the freshmen and sophomores who came through at Nos. 2 through 5 singles to win the match, with sophomore Jason Teitelbaum clinching the it at No. 3.


After dropping his first set, 4-6, he won the second, 6-3, to force a third set that would decide the entire match.



With all eyes on him, Teitelbaum said he knew the match was on his shoulders. And when he took the third set tiebreak, 7-4, he was hit with a rush of relief that overtook the exhaustion from playing such a long match in the heat and sun.  

“We really needed this win,” Teitelbaum said. “I was really tired after that match; it was grueling. I’m glad that I was able to win it for the seniors and their families who were all there watching. That was a great feeling.”

Berkowitz and freshmen Daniel Lakhman and Eric Chavis all won their singles matches in straight sets.

Berkowitz and Chavis dropped just three and four games, respectively, at Nos. 4 and 5, while Lakhman won his first set in a tiebreak before finishing off his opponent, 6-2, in the second at No. 2.

It was Muhlenberg’s second conference win in a week, but more importantly, Teitelbaum said, it was the perfect sendoff to a group that has meant so much to the squad.

“I’m really close with all the seniors, especially Jordan since he’s my doubles partner,” Teitelbaum said. “They’re all great guys, and we always hang out together. It’s definitely going to be really hard when they leave.”

women’s basketball walks for cancer cure



Nearly 50 people associated with the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team – current and former players, current and former coaches and parents of former players –
participated in the Susan G. Komen 5K Walk “Race for the Cure” to raise money and awareness for breast cancer and associated research in Scranton on Saturday.

Between this event and other efforts over the last four months, the Mules have donated over $2,500 to the cause in support of one of their teammates. 

“It was one of my happiest days I have ever had as a coach, to be surrounded by so many great women who sincerely care about each other,”
said head coach Ron Rohn. “We always talk about the special bond our team has, and to see how it continues long after graduation was truly uplifting
– and once again made me realize how lucky I am to do what I do, surrounded by the people I am lucky enough to coach.”

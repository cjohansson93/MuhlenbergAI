Night of Firsts as Men's Soccer Shuts Out Moravian
 Wednesday, September 12, 2012







					 


The soccer pitch was filled with “firsts” for Muhlenberg men’s team as it shut out Moravian, 5-0, in the first contest of the 2012-13 Matte Award competition.




Welcome to the club! Joseph (left) and Katz (right and below) celebrate their first goals.



Four Muhlenberg players scored the first goals of their collegiate careers. And for senior midfielder Jon Majoros, the game was his first start as a Mule soccer player.

“It was very exciting. It took a long time to get that first start. I had to wait until my senior year since I tore my ACL last year and missed the entire season. I’m very happy to have finally gotten the opportunity to start,” said Majoros, after receiving a hug and kiss from his “Aunt Mare.”

Both teams looked sluggish at the outset of the game, but the Mules kicked their offense into gear after 32 minutes when Cody Antonini took a shot, had it blocked back to his feet and fired again, finding the back of the net. It was Antonini’s fourth goal of the season.

It was clear that the Mules were settling into a rhythm when freshman forward Dan Joseph entered the game for Antonini just before a Muhlenberg throwin. Antonini had barely stepped off the field when Joseph netted the Mules’ second goal of the night off a cross from Chris Royer. It was his first goal as a collegiate player, and three of his teammates would follow suit in the second half.

“At halftime, Coach told us to calm down and play how we know how to play,” said Majoros.


That play resulted in the Mules (3-1) padding their lead. Just before the 60-minute mark, sophomore Oliver Katz scored the first goal of his career off a cross from his brother, junior Jeremy Katz.

Perhaps drawing inspiration from Joseph and Katz, sophomore Joey Roberts was the third Muhlenberg player to score his first collegiate goal. Three minutes later, junior Brendan McIntyre netted a penalty kick for his first career goal.

“What we did particularly well tonight was keeping possession a lot and putting the ball in the net. There were other games this season where we had possession but weren’t able to do that,” said Majoros.

The Mules outshot the Greyhounds 22-9, and Moravian took just one corner kick the entire game.



Women Fall at Messiah

 
  
The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team fell at fourth-ranked Messiah, 3-0. 
  
 
  
The Mules (2-3-1) trailed only 1-0 at halftime to the perennial national championship contenders, who toppled Centennial Conference favorite Johns Hopkins 4-0 last week. Freshman Francesca Cobuzzi
made a career-high eight saves.

It was the first time since a 5-1 win against Haverford in 2008 that five different players scored for Muhlenberg. The last time five different players netted goals and the Mules shut out their opponent was almost exactly eight years ago in game against Hunter on September 11, 2004.

Another first came for sophomore goalie Danny Pinto, who joined the team midway through the 2011 season. He made his first appearance on the field and he recorded the first save of his career in the final seven minutes of the game.

Also logging saves for the Mules were starting goalie Jas Chojnowski and freshman goalie Ellison Heil.

 “We worked hard tonight and got the job done. We had to bounce back after our loss at Ithaca and tonight we got back on track,” said junior back Bucky Aronoff.

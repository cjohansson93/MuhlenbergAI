Teaching Interests
My goal in the classroom is to provide students with an opportunity to define their artistic direction, take risks and learn from failure. Both in the studio and classroom, I weave together myths, history, contemporary politics and pop culture. I provide students with tools for manipulating form and body. Through a gradual journey through the relationship between form and concept, students take from their experiencesâwhether background, interests or identityâdifferent ways of tackling notions of maker, object and audience.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy multimedia sculptures materialize an effort to define and redefine my placement as an American and global citizen. Themes wander the liminal spaces surrounding the other, wealth, and the state, balancing the violent contradictions of these borderlands: guilt against duty and exclusion against entitlement. Growing up African American of mixed heritage in rural Pennsylvania and living a foreigner in Europe, tempered my resolve to dissect the myth of the historical figure and to eat, digest, and regurgitate it as new fable. With an ethical compass that hovers between dutiful responsibility and post-punk cynicism. I allow folk art to inspire me; relentlessly appropriating tools of the artist unknown, the vanquished, merchandising, underground comics, pop idols and populist propaganda.

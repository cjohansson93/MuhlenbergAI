Preserving and Sharing a Community History



PBS39 learns more about the effort to preserve and explore important cultural artifacts and moments of the Lehigh Valley's LGBT community.


	 Thursday, July 18, 2019  04:02 PM

This summer students from Muhlenberg College and Lehigh University are working to catalog, organize and preserve Lehigh Valley LGBT History. The materials in the Lehigh Valley LGBT Community Archive include photos, documents and recordsâ âboth personal and publicâ âthat make up the history of the region's LGBT+ individuals, businesses and programs.
The initial creation of the archive is part of a 10-week research project, though the completion of the project will take significantly more time. The permanent collection will remain housed at Muhlenberg College's Trexler Memorial Library.

In the video above, Adrian Shanker '09, executive director of Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, and Susan Falciani Maldonado, special collections and archives librarian, discuss the creation and importance of the Lehigh Valley LGBT Community Archive, which is housed at Trexler Library. The article and accompanying video, used with permission, were produced by Stephen Jiwanmall and originally published on July 16, 2019 and are copyright PBS39/WLVT Lehigh Valley Public Telecommunications Corporation.

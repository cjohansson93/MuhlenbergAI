Women’s Soccer
Muhlenberg lost at home for the first time this year, 3-0 to No. 8 Johns Hopkins.

The final score was not entirely indicative of the play, which was back and forth for much of the night. The Blue Jays (11-0-3, 7-0), one of seven undefeated teams in Division III, scored late in the first half. The Mules (8-4-2, 3-2-1) opened the second half with a flurry of shots, but could not score. Hopkins netted its second goal midway through the half and added a third marker with 5:07 left.

Cross Country
The harriers competed in their last regular-season competition today in the Leopard Invitational at Lafayette.  The meet consisted primarily of Division I schools, and the teams did very well.
 
The women placed fifth in the eight-team race and were beaten by Division II power Kutztown as well as Division I American, Lafayette and Rutgers.  They beat Division I Seton Hall and La Salle and Division II East Stroudsburg.
The men placed seventh out of 10 teams, finishing ahead of Kutztown, Lafayette and Widener.
 
Senior Timothy VanSyckle placed sixth overall, finishing only behind two athletes from American and three unattached athletes.  The women were led by sophomore Kate Mahoney, who placed 13th overall.

Leischner has six career goals.



Second-half goals by seniors Billy Dalton and Greg Leischner lifted the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team to a come-from-behind 2-1 win at McDaniel. 

The Green Terror took a 1-0 lead midway through the first half when an attempted clearing pass caromed off the back of a Muhlenberg player and into the net. 

Barely more than a minute into the second half, Dalton drove a shot on the ground inside the left post to tie the score. Four minutes later, junior Samuel Hayden played a long ball over the top to sophomore Tom Reilly. His shot was saved, but the rebound popped right to Leischner, who put in his second goal of the season. 

The Mules (9-3-1, 3-2-1), who have won five straight at McDaniel, are tied with Gettysburg for fourth place in the Centennial Conference with three games remaining.

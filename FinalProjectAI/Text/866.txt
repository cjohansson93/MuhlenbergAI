Welcome to the online home for the Student Government Association!

We advocate for students to positively impact campus life and provide support for the various student organizations.  Here you can view information about our various committees, projects and activities. Get to know the current members, download important forms, read meeting minutes, and much more. Most of all, this web site is a resource to keep you informed about what your Student Government is doing.

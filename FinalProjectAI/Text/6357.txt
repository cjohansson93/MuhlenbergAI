The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was ranked 22nd in the final USA Today ESPN Division III poll of the 2011-12 season released by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.




Seniors Kathleen Naddaff, Katy Rossino, Alexandra Chili and Kimberly Mui (left to right) will graduate as the winningest class in program history, with a four-year record of 93-22. For more on the foursome, see their senior profiles in today’s 
MuhlBox.




The Mules finished the year with a record of 23-6 and won their fifth Centennial Conference championship in seven years. They earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament for the fifth straight year and 
defeated Catholic in the first round. In the second round, Muhlenberg led sixth-ranked Mount Union up until the last minute before falling, 61-55.

In the “Sweet 16,” Mount Union played another game that came down to the closing minute, falling to Illinois Wesleyan by one point on a buzzer-beater. Illinois Wesleyan went on to win the national championship, defeating George Fox in the title game.

Last year, Muhlenberg lost to the team that won the national championship (Amherst), and this year the Mules lost to the team that lost to the team that won the national championship.

This is the third time in the last four years that the Mules have been ranked in the final WBCA poll. In both 2009 and 2011, they were 15th.

 In the D3hoops.com final poll, Muhlenberg received 12 votes.

Two Muhlenberg football players were honored by the Centennial Conference after leading their team to a share of the CC championship with a 27-20 win
against Ursinus yesterday.

Junior defensive end Kenneth Cobb was named defensive player of the week.

Cobb was a disruptive force in the backfield all game long, recording 4½

sacks for losses of 46 yards. He had at least one sack in each quarter. The 4½ sacks were the most by a 
CC player since 2004 and one short of the school record set by Dan McCall, also against Ursinus, in 2003.

Cobb totaled seven tackles in the game and forced a fumble with one of his sacks. His play helped Muhlenberg hold the Bears to 33 rushing yards on 32 carries.

For the season, Cobb leads the CC with nine sacks and is second with 14 tackles for loss. The Mules lead the CC in scoring defense (16.4 points per game),
pass defense (166.0 yards per game) and pass efficiency defense (95.6) and are less than five yards behind Ursinus for the lead in total defense.

Sophomore quarterback Dan Deighan was named co-offensive player of the week. 

Deighan accounted for all four Muhlenberg touchdowns
in the win, running for two and throwing for a pair.  He ran for a career-high 75 yards on only 11 carries against a Bear 
unit that was eighth in Division III in rushing defense. At right, he crosses the goal line on his 17-yard touchdown run late in the first half.

Although Deighan completed only nine passes in the game, he made his completions count. Five of them came on third down and went for first downs,
including both Td passes: a 56-yard deep ball to Isaiah Vaughn on third-and-16 and a 20-yard toss to Jon Liberty on
third-and-2.

Deighan is fifth in the CC in total offense, and among quarterbacks who have been starting the whole season, he has the second-fewest interceptions.

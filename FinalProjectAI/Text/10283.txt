Join Democracy in Crisis: Elections in 2020, a non-partisan, virtual event open to all on Wednesday, September 23 at 6:30 p.m.
The event is co-sponsored by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion and Keep Our Republic, a Washington, DC, based non-profit which aims to "discover, highlight and prevent an array of extraordinary threats to the integrity of the 2020 Election and Transition."Former Congressman and Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Committee of Seventy President and CEO David Thornburgh, and veteran constitutional lawyer Mary McCord of Georgetown Law School will host an open discussion about the election challenges and solutions, moderated by Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.
The 2020 election presents unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threats of foreign interference and social unrest. Experts predict that full election results may not be available for many days or even weeks after November 3. Pennsylvania is a pivotal state that must put in place measures to ensure the integrity of the election process.Learn more and sign up to join the conversation: https://keepourrepublic.com/muhlenberg/

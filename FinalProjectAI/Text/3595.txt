wrestlers slain by dragons



The Muhlenberg wrestling teams hospitality towards Oneonta State went a little too far.

With the Red Dragons (8-4-1) staying in the area between tournaments, the Mules allowed Oneonta State to practice in the Life Sports Center and scheduled 
a dual meet to give both teams a chance to get some live competition.

Unfortunately for Muhlenberg (0-4), most of the action went the way of the Dragons as they ruined the Mules first dual meet of 2011 with a 40-3 win.

Senior Keith Swanson earned the Mules lone win of the night with a 4-1 decision at 157. With the score tied 1-1 after a pair of escapes, 
Swanson (right) was awarded a stalling point to move ahead 2-1 in the final minute. But instead of just trying to preserve his lead, Swanson continued to attack 
and used a quick shot to work a double leg takedown to seal the match with less than 20 seconds remaining in the third period.

Women's Basketball Ranked 5th in Region


The Muhlenberg women's basketball team is fifth in the Mid-Atlantic Region in the second NCAA regional rankings of the season.


	 Friday, February 20, 2015  10:02 AM

The rankings are produced by the same committee that will determine bids to and seeding for the NCAA Tournament next Sunday.Here are the complete rankings, with records through Feburary 15:1. Salisbury (22-1)2. Scranton (22-2)3. Stevenson (20-2)4. McDaniel (22-1)5. Muhlenberg (16-6)6. Albright (17-6)The Mules moved into the rankings after an impressive 72-48 win against Elizabethtown, which has ranked fifth in the region last week. The rankings do not reflect Tuesday's loss to Stevens, the fourth-ranked team in the East Region.Now 17-7, Muhlenberg closes out its regular season at Ursinus on Saturday. McDaniel, whose only previous loss had been to Muhlenberg, was defeated by Johns Hopkins last night and is a game ahead of the Mules in the Centennial Conference standings. But even if the two teams tie for first place, McDaniel will host the CC semifinals and final next weekend. Muhlenberg is locked into the No. 2 seed.

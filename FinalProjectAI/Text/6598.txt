Hopkins Teams Rain on Homecoming Parade
 Friday, September 21, 2012







					 



Homecoming Weekend began with contests against Johns Hopkins in two sports, but the visiting teams spoiled the festivities.

The undefeated Blue Jay volleyball team extended its regular-season winning streak to 27 with a 3-0 sweep, and field hockey handed Muhlenberg its second straight 2-0
loss.

In volleyball, the Mules (8-5, 1-2) made things interesting in the third set after dropping the first two, 25-17 and 25-9. Muhlenberg came back from a 17-12 deficit to take
a 19-17 lead behind the serving of sophomore Lindsey Gambocurta and three kills by freshman Katherine Boll. The teams were tied
for the ninth time in the set at 22-all, but Hopkins (14-0, 1-0) ran off the last three points.

Boll (right) finished with a team-high 10 kills. Freshmen Vanessa Pulice and Chelsea Kaser recorded 24 assists and 16 digs, respectively.

Muhlenberg (4-3, 1-2) took four shots on goal early in the field hockey game, but Hopkins scored the first goal midway through the first half and added an insurance goal 
midway through the second.

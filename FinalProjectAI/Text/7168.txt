Dotzman (somewhere in there) celebrates after his team-leading fourth goal of the season.




In the final home event on Homecoming Saturday, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team suffered a disappointing 2-1 overtime loss to previously winless Gettysburg
in its Centennial Conference opener.

The Mules (4-3, 0-1) controlled play for most of the game, with a 23-6 advantage in shots. But they could not find the back of the net until 14:13 remained, when
junior Travis Wantchekon was taken down in the box and junior Lance Dotzman converted the penalty kick.

Gettysburg stunned the rain-soaked crowd by scoring the equalizer with 5:52 left in regulation, then handed Muhlenberg its second straight overtime loss on a
penalty kick midway through the first extra period.

In the first on-campus event of the day, volleyball threw a scare into two-time defending champion Johns Hopkins before falling in three sets.

The Mules (6-5, 1-1) rallied late in the first set, cutting a 21-16 deficit to one point, at 22-21. The Blue Jays (6-4, 2-0) closed out the set, however, 25-22.




Sophomore Erin Murphy tied for the team lead with six kills against the Blue Jays.





The second set was even closer, featuring nine ties, the last at 19-19. Again Hopkins finished strong to win, 25-20, and the Blue Jays jumped out to a 9-1 lead
en route to capturing the third set, 25-17.

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team had defeated a nationally ranked Johns Hopkins squad three of the last four years, but it was a different story this time.
The Blue Jays, ranked No. 1 in Division III by D3soccer.com, scored three goals in the first 10 minutes of the second half and went on to a 5-0 win.

The field hockey team could not hold on to an early 1-0 lead and fell at Johns Hopkins, 2-1. Senior Dayna Hovern scored her first goal of the
season, and the 12th of her career, by redirecting a blast from junior Kayleigh Thies off a penalty corner.

Hopkins (4-2, 2-0) tied the score with just under two minutes left in the first half and went ahead early in the second. The Mules (2-4, 1-1) had a 17-14
advantage in shots for the game but could not net the tying goal.

Early Goals Sink Men's Soccer in Key Matchup
 Thursday, September 27, 2012







					 





Junior Jeff Reinhart battles for possession during the first half.



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team came halfway back but could not erase an early hole and fell, 2-1, in a hard-fought battle against Centennial Conference foe Swarthmore. 

The Garnet is ranked 19th in the nation by D3soccer.com. It was the first loss for the Mules at Varsity Field since they fell to Merchant Marine in the 2010 NCAA Tournament.

Swarthmore (6-1-1, 2-0-1) struck early with a pair of headers, one in the 10th minute of play following a free kick and another in the 13th minute following a corner kick.

Senior Cody Antonini got the Mules on the scoreboard with 22 seconds to go in the half after he tracked down a ball that had ricocheted off a Swarthmore defender and put it away from the top of the 18-yard box. 

It was the 40th career goal for Antonini, making him the 16th player in CC history to reach that milestone.

Muhlenberg (5-2, 2-1) put pressure on Swarthmore throughout the second half, taking 11 shots, but could not find the equalizer.

Sophomore Bryan Attanasio made a key stop with about seven minutes remaining in the second half to keep the Mules in the game. After a corner kick, Attanasio blocked a shot just inside the left post, preventing the Garnet from gaining a two-goal lead.

Four yellow cards were distributed in the physical contest, two on each team. Play was relatively equal throughout both halves and Swarthmore edged the Mules by just one shot, 17-16.

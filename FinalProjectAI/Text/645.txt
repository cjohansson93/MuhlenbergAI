Kelly Tornetta '19 has been named a 2018-19 Rossing Physics Scholar. She will receive $5,000 from the Thomas D. Rossing Fund for Physics Education given to exemplary students in the field by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).
A physics major and mathematics minor, Kelly is one of 12 annual award winners selected from 26 ELCA colleges and universities nationwide.
Last summer, Kelly had the opportunity to conduct research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on Long Island, NY, with Brett Fadem, associate professor of physics. Through a National Science Foundation grant, Fadem brings students to BNL each summer to learn about nuclear physics and work alongside some of the world's foremost physicists.
Summer research experience often helps students clarify how they intend to target their efforts during undergraduate and graduate education. "We believe that the focus on collaborative and interdisciplinary learning is paramount," says Fadem.
A graduate of Pope John Paul II High School, Kelly is also an outstanding member of the Muhlenberg's women's volleyball team.

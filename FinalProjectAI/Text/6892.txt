Baseball Scores Early, Late to Beat Ursinus

In his second at-bat against Ursinus, Joseph Vila lifted a pop fly that was misjudged in the sun and wind, falling in just behind the shortstop position for a single.




Rosen is hitting .413 and is tied for second on the team with 17 RBI.



But that’s not how the senior outfielder became one of the all-time leaders in extra-base hits in Muhlenberg baseball history. Vila was more true to form late in the game, hitting a home run and a triple in his last two at-bats to lead the Mules to a wild 14-11 win in their Centennial Conference home opener.

Muhlenberg won despite squandering an early-seven run lead and falling behind twice. The Mules (13-8, 2-1) pounded out 19 hits (eight for extra bases), including four by senior John Muha and three apiece by Vila, junior Brett Rosen and sophomore Kurt Johnson




Leopold's big double was the first hit of his career.



Doubles by Muha, senior Jimmy Aramanda and junior John Scuderi contributed to a four-run first for the Mules, and two-out run-scoring singles by junior Nick Kennedy and Rosen made it 7-0 after only two innings.

But the Bears (4-13, 0-3) came back, scoring six runs in the top of the fourth and taking a 9-8 lead with two in the top of the fifth.

With two outs in the bottom of the sixth, Vila cranked a drive that hit off the top of the fence in left-center and bounced over for his 10th career home run. The game-tying blast made Vila the fourth player in team history to reach double figures in career doubles, triples and home runs.

Ursinus quickly regained the lead, scoring twice in the top of the seventh. The Bears brought in a new pitcher to start the bottom of the seventh, and Rosen greeted him with a long blast to left-center for his first career home run, making the score 11-10.

One out later, freshman Jordan Leopold hit a pinch-hit double, and after a groundout, Muha delivered a game-tying single. Johnson followed with a double, chasing Muha to third. Vila brought home the go-ahead runs with a triple to deep center.

The two extra-base hits gave Vila 51 for his career, good for fourth on the Mules’ all-time list, just four away from the school record. And the three RBI gave him an even 100, making him the fifth Mule to reach the century mark.

Vila scored the fifth run of the inning on an error. Sophomore Nick Gies held the three-run lead with a scoreless eighth, and senior Ryan Rechten worked the ninth to move into a tie for second in team history with 11 career saves.

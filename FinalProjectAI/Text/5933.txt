Women's Tennis Drops Moravian to Take Matte Lead

On a day that was so gorgeous it almost felt like spring, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team appeared almost as if it was in midseason form during its lone fall dual match against Moravian.

The young Mules, who featured four players appearing in their first career match, swept through doubles play and won the middle four singles matches to beat the Greyhounds, 7-2. With the win, Muhlenberg grabbed a 2-1 lead over its Lehigh Valley rival in the Matte Award competition.

Muhlenberg opened play by dropping just five games total in its three doubles matches against a Moravian squad that entered the match with a 2-1 record, including a win over Division I La Salle.

Sophomore Emily Szulman kept the Mule momentum going with a quick straight-sets win at No. 2 singles. Not long after, freshman Jennifer Goldberg finished off her Greyhound opponent, dropping only two sets in the process, to seal the victory.

Freshman Sharen Resnikoff came from behind to take her first set, 7-5, before winning her match at No. 4 singles, and junior Amanda von Taube (left) only dropped three sets all day as she won her singles match in straight sets and teamed with Resnikoff for an 8-0 win at No. 2 doubles.

In addition to her singles win, Goldberg also paired with freshman Ashlee Ludwig to grab a victory at No. 3 doubles.

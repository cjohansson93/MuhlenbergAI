Season Preview

men’s tennis courts success


The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team has put in a lot of time on the court in preparation for the 2009 season. And not just the tennis court.

The Mules, who are scheduled to open with a home match against Arcadia tomorrow, have a large roster of 18 players, half of whom are newcomers. But team unity hasn’t been an issue.

“I was surprised at how well this group has

come together,” said Brian Wernick, one of only two seniors on the roster. “In previous years it wasn’t as much of a team. We all like each other, we hang out, we even had our own intramural basketball team.”

And how did that go? “We didn’t do too well – we’re going to stick to tennis,” joked Wernick.

That’s a good idea. Muhlenberg finished the 2008 year with an 8-7 record, its first winning record and most wins since the 2003 squad went 9-2. The Mules’ 3-6 Centennial Conference mark ended a string of four straight years with only two league victories.

“We want to continue to improve,” said Wernick.

To do that, Muhlenberg will rely on a mix of returning players and newcomers. Injuries last year forced the Mules to juggle their lineup numerous times, and as a result many players have experience.

Sophomore Dan Zakheim is the top candidate to move into the No. 1 singles spot after playing two matches there last year. Wernick and junior Yoni Farber, who are serving as co-captains, are veterans who lead all active Mules with 25 and 20 career wins, respectively. Sophomore John Osborne had a combined record of 10-13 in an injury-plagued freshman season, and fellow soph Wayne Mitchel had a team-leading 8-3 singles record in spring dual matches.

And then there are the freshmen. Two of them, Zach Adler and Jordan Rutt, reached the doubles consolation final at the F&M Fall Invitational their first time playing together. Adler will figure high in the singles lineup.

“These young guys are really good,” noted Wernick. “They have a great work ethic, and they’re very mature.

“We’re setting up for a team that’s going to be really good the next 2-3 years.”

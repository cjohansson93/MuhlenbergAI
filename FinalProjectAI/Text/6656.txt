Carnevale Lowers Hurdles Record at ECACs
 Friday, March 1, 2013







					 




The Penn Relays Carnival is still eight weeks away, but the Muhlenberg record book Carnevale has been ongoing since January.

Junior Stephanie Carnevale broke a school record for the fifth time in six weeks, running the 60-meter hurdles in 8.97 seconds on the first
day of the ECAC Championships at the Armory in New York City.

Carnevale won her heat and is scheduled to race in the final tomorrow morning. Going into this weekend’s last chance meets, only 12 hurdlers in Division III
had posted a faster time this season, and two of them – one from Rowan and one from Wheaton (Mass.) – will be in the final along with Carnevale.

Carnevale missed the Centennial Conference record by just two hundredths of a second but shattered the mark of 9.05 she set last week while winning gold at
the CC Championships. At the start of the season, Carnevale held the school record at 9.31. She has also broken records in the 60-meter dash and
55-meter hurdles this year.

The only other Mule to compete at the ECAC Championships, junior Erin Saucier, set a personal record by clearing 11 feet, one-quarter inch in
the pole vault. Saucier (right) tied for ninth place.

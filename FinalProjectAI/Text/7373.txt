Men's Lacrosse Edged by Richard Stockton

Despite a record-setting performance and a bevy of milestones, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse dropped its third straight game, 11-9 at home against Richard Stockton in its final tuneup before beginning Centennial Conference play.

Jason Mertz had a hand in every goal but one for the Mules (1-5). The junior scored two of them and assisted on six others, setting a school record for assists in a game. His eight points matched the all-time mark accomplished three times previously, most recently in 2011. 

Senior Matthew Gallo (right), junior Michael Heenan and freshman Brad D’Alessandro were all the beneficiaries of Mertz’s precise passing, each netting his first career goal. Heenan’s tied the score at 3 with just 4.9 seconds left in the first quarter, and D’Alessandro’s came with 18.6 seconds remaining in the second period, sending the teams into intermission deadlocked at 5.

The Ospreys (5-2) scored the first two goals after the break, but senior Tom Glancy found the back of the net three minutes apart to pull Muhlenberg even at 7 late in the third and set off a wild finish.

Richard Stockton took a 10-8 lead on a goal with six minutes to play, but the Mules answered back, with junior Pat Farrell scoring his second goal just over a minute later. The Ospreys had possession and a chance to run out the clock, but threw away a pass with 1:21 remaining, giving Muhlenberg one last chance. The Mules got off a shot, but the Stockton goalie was equal to the task, making the save and jumpstarting a fast break that culminated in an insurance tally with 4.7 ticks left.

Freshman Elliot Dennis was a career-best 17-of-24 on faceoffs, which tied for the fourth-highest single-game total in Muhlenberg history. Junior goalie Adam Schlauch made a season-high 15 saves, many of the highlight-reel variety, while junior Connor Winter picked up a career-high eight ground balls.

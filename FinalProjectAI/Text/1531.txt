Foundations for Student Success
Foundation for Student Success (PPD 050) is designed to develop an understanding of one's holistic wellbeing. We will explore topics around your personal development, career development, and understanding of your community responsibilities as well as support services and campus initiatives to enhance your ability to thrive within the Muhlenberg community and beyond. We will use discussions, assignments, and readings to enable you to strive for your highest potential.

Schauer Pushes Men's Soccer Past Wilkes

Not even a hot goalie could keep the Muhlenberg men’s soccer  team off the scoreboard at Wilkes.

Sophomore Jonathan Schauer (left) buried a pass from junior Danny Way in the 39th minute to put Muhlenberg up by one. Schauer’s second career goal would be all the Mules would need as they shut out the Colonels, 1-0.

Muhlenberg outshot Wilkes 27-4, but the Colonel keeper made 18 saves to keep his team in the game. The Mule defense, meanwhile, allowed only one shot on goal. 

The win moves Muhlenberg to 4-0 for the first time since 2005, and the shutout, the Mules’ third in a row, extends their scoreless streak to 313 minutes.

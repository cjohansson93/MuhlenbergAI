Men's Basketball Falls at F&M Wrestling Competes in Tri-Match
 Saturday, February 15, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team was held to its lowest scoring output of the season in a 66-46 setback at Franklin & Marshall. 



The Mules (15-8, 10-6) had a chance to take over sole possession of third place in the Centennial Conference, but the Diplomats (15-8, 11-5) did so by sweeping the season series. Muhlenberg, tied with Johns Hopkins for fourth, still holds a one-game advantage on sixth-place Gettysburg with two to play, and can clinch a playoff spot with one win or one Bullets loss.

Sophomore Alec Stavetski led the Mules with 12 points. Senior Austin Curry (left) added 10 and knocked down a pair of three-pointers, putting him within two of tying the school’s all-time record for career triples (192).

The Mules got off to a fast start, taking a 15-6 lead less than five minutes in on a three by Curry. But F&M righted the ship, scoring 10 of the next 12 points and closing the first half on an 8-0 run to take a 31-25 lead into intermission. The Diplomats built a double-digit lead eight minutes into the second stanza and cruised from there, shooting 62 percent from the field after halftime to pull away.

Just two Muhlenberg wrestlers competed in a home tri-match with undefeated Ursinus and Washington and Lee, the team’s final competition before next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships.

Due to forfeits, the Mules lost to Washington and Lee, 36-9, and Ursinus, 57-0.
 
Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit (right) won the only bout for the Mules, coming from behind to take a 4-3 decision at 149 against an opponent from W&L. Chengsupanimit found himself trailing, 3-0, late in the second period, but fought back with a pair of takedowns, seizing the lead for good less than a minute into the third period. Chengsupanimit was able to hold on from there for a hard-earned victory, his eighth of the season.

Freshman Jaryd Flank took on Division III’s top-ranked wrestler at 125 against Ursinus.

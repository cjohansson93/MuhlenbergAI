Long Balls Do Not End Long Drought for Baseball

Despite getting home runs from Brian Beck and Nick Busillo, the Muhlenberg baseball team lost at Dickinson, 6-4.

The senior left-handed hitters in the middle of the lineup helped stake the Mules to a 4-1 lead midway through the game. Beck hit a two-run homer, his third of the
season, in the third, and Busillo belted his sixth round-tripper in the fifth. The solo shot gave Busillo 40 RBI on the season, making him only the fifth player in
team history to drive in 40.

Dickinson (21-11, 8-6) tied the game with three in the bottom of the fifth, then scored go-ahead and insurance runs in the seventh and eighth to send Muhlenberg (18-18, 2-12) to its 10th
straight loss.

Junior John Muha (left) went 3-for-5 to increase his season hit total to 52, one more than sophomore Nick Kennedy. They are only the
fifth pair of Mule teammates to each record 50 hits in a season.

Freshman Chris Manfredonia singled in the third, extending his school-record hitting streak to 20 games.

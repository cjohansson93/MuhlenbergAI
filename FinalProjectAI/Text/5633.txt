gibbs reaches softball coaching milestone


Dominant pitching, timely hitting and aggressive baserunning are all ingredients that have led to Ruth Gibbs becoming the winningest softball coach in Muhlenberg history. And they

Knights Rain on Mules’ Parade



The Muhlenberg baseball team fell to New Jersey City, 4-2, in a night game called after eight innings due to rain.

The loss spoiled a strong outing by sophomore Dan Fisher, who worked into the seventh inning, struck out seven and allowed only one earned run.

The Mules (2-4) managed only three hits. Their runs scored on a passed ball in the first and a bases-loaded walk in the second.

200th career game when the Mules defeated Beloit, 6-3, in the first of two contests at the Rebel Spring Games. She fell short of No. 201 in the second game, a 4-1 loss to Aurora, leaving the squad with a 3-5 record.

Junior Lara Kestenbaum provided the pitching, allowing only an infield single in the first 6 2/3 innings. She retired 16 of 17 batters in one stretch, the only exception reaching on an error. Kestenbaum was one out away from a shutout, but Beloit strung together a walk and three singles to plate three runs in the bottom of the seventh.

Muhlenberg scored one in the first and two in the second to jump on top. Freshman Jess Kasza singled in a run in the first. In the second, freshman Alyssa Epstein scored from third on a grounder to third when she broke for home after the fielder released the ball. Junior RiRi Ferrigno added a two-out RBI single.

The game remained 3-0 until the Mules scored what would turn out to be three important runs in the top of the seventh. Ferrigno had the big hit, an RBI double, and two runs crossed when junior Michelle Consiglio’s slow roller to short was thrown away.

Against a strong Aurora team, Muhlenberg hung tough behind a solid pitching effort from freshman Ashley Brewer, who allowed two runs and six hits through six innings and worked out of a bases-loaded, nobody-out jam in the fourth. Aurora added some breathing room by scoring two runs in the seventh.

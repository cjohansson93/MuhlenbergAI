Community Update: July 8, 2020
Wednesday, July 8, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
In the two weeks since our last community message, quite a lot has happened. I know that you are eager to hear more about our return to campus, but first I want to share updates about the Collegeâs response to the national movement against racial injustice.
Anti-Racism at Muhlenberg
Shortly after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and the nation-wide protests that began thereafter, the Black faculty of Muhlenberg sent the community a letter addressing the experiences of Black students, faculty and staff at Muhlenberg. The letter included recommendations to make the College more inclusive and anti-racist. Some of these suggestions were part of the planning that the administration was involved in and were included in an email I sent on June 16 with actions the College was committed to implementing. As stated in my message, this is not the end of our commitment to action, only the beginning.
On July 6, the Muhlenberg College Board of Trustees issued a statement affirming the College âwill do better and more to dismantle racism and injustice.â Muhlenberg is a strong and collaborative community and I want to thank the Board for their support of these initiatives. I look forward to continuing to work with all members of our community in making our campus more equitable for all.
Support for International Students
Yesterday I shared information with the campus community about the federal governmentâs recent ruling regarding approved course modalities for F-1 visa status students studying in the United States. We are committed to supporting our international students and will be updating the College community on the current plans and contingency options to ensure that our students have access to their education. The College will participate in national efforts to respond to this ruling as our higher education professional organizations develop action plans.
COVID-19 in Pennsylvania
On June 26, Lehigh County moved into the stateâs green phase, allowing for the responsible reopening of businesses. New cases in the county have been trending downward although, as with much of the country, we did experience a slight uptick which has since moved downward again. As shared in my June 24 email, we are currently in the midst of preparing our campus for students, faculty and staff to safely return, but there is still much to accomplish. I want to thank our students, faculty and staff for responding to the planning surveys as we finalize the details for being back on campus and continue to monitor the virus in our region.
Reopening Campus - Testing and Tracing
One of the most critical dimensions of our returnâa plan for testing and contact tracingâis currently being finalized. Student Health Services will conduct COVID-19 testing regularly throughout the semester. Testing will be provided through both on-campus resources and established relationships with local healthcare networks and our community partners. In alignment with the most recent CDC and American College Health guidance, for now, we will plan to test close contacts when a student receives a positive test result for the virus. Because the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to evolve rapidly, our testing strategy will be adaptable to the situation. Additionally, students, faculty and staff will need to complete a daily screening online to ensure they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. Any students with symptoms will be directed to contact the Health Center. We will also conduct routine touchless temperature checks at high traffic areas like the Wood Dining Commons and the Life Sports Center and random touchless temperature checks around campus. Read about our current plans online. 
Reopening Campus - Housing
Shortly after announcing our decision, we began the process of collecting information from students regarding their decisions for the fall semester to inform campus housing plans. We will be using all of our available residence halls for housing while engaging with a local hotel for any additional quarantine needs. To de-densify our residence halls, we have changed some housing policies including allowing more students to commute to campus, eliminating many triples to ensure proper physical distancing and estimating the number of students who will remain at home in remote learning, etc.  At this point we anticipate that we will not need to fully redo the housing lottery, but will be able to work with individual students whose housing assignments need to be adjusted.
Reopening Campus - Fall Course Scheduling
Courses will be taught in various modalities, in-person, in a blended mode (part in-person, part in digital spaces) or completely in digital formats. Offering varied course modalities ensures that classrooms will support required physical distancing and accommodates students and faculty who need to remain at home for health or personal reasons. The Fall schedule will be released in the coming weeks. Many of the courses will remain the same, but information about the course modality will be provided. This information will enable students to have informed conversations with their advisors and drop/add courses as needed. Finally, this academic year, we will offer a January term, which allows students to spread their full-time course load over the fall and January terms as needed. We will share details and dates once finalized.
Reopening Campus - Athletics
Yesterday afternoon the Centennial Conference released the following statement regarding fall athletics:
âGiven health and other related concerns, the Centennial Conference Presidents Council has decided to suspend any intercollegiate competition for sports scheduled for the fall semester. The presidents will reevaluate this decision by the end of September, based on work to be done by the Conference to assess sports-specific activities and the experiences on the schoolsâ campuses. The presidents have determined football will not be played in the fall. The Conference will also explore the possibility of shifting certain fall sports, including football, to the spring.â 
This decision was not made lightly. All of the schools in the Centennial Conference deeply value our athletes and the opportunities for athletic competition. In collaboration with the members of the Conference, we are committed to reviewing conditions and trying to find ways to accommodate the desire of our athletes to engage in competition when it is safe to do so. The Centennial Conference college presidents will reconvene in September to re-evaluate the ability for specific sports to return to competition. Football will not be able to compete this fall. As such, the conference will consider if football and any other sports that are not able to compete this fall are able to have a Spring season instead.
As we plan for our return to campus in the fall, the health and safety of all members of the College community continue to be our priority. We will monitor evolving conditions and guidance from national, state and local public health experts and will provide updates as new information is available. Additionally, we will continue to hold webinars for all campus audiences âstudents, faculty and staffâto share additional information as it becomes available and to provide an opportunity to answer your questions. Dates and details for the student and family webinars were shared by the Dean of Students. Information about faculty and staff webinars will be emailed soon. 
In the meantime, I want to thank each of you for the care and concern you have expressed for one another and the on-going work that our faculty, staff and student leaders are doing to plan for the next academic year. The time and effort devoted to preparing for the fall semester are a continual reminder that our deep sense of community and collaboration is our strength.
Be safe. Be well.
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringPresident

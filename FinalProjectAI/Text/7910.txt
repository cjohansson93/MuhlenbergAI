Basketball Teams on Opposite Ends of Thrilling Openers
 Saturday, November 15, 2014 - page 4







					 




If the opening day is any indication, it’s going to be an exciting year of Muhlenberg basketball.


Both Mule teams played thrillers that came down the wire, with the men defeating Albright, 80-77, and
the women falling at home to Moravian, 61-60.

The men led by 12 points at halftime of their game, which was played at Arcadia on the first day of the
Centennial/MAC Challenge, but Albright rebounded to go ahead by six with 11 minutes left. In the final 10
minutes, neither team led by more than three points.

The Lions went ahead 76-75 on a layup with 1:39 to play before senior Malique Killing drilled
a three-pointer 22 seconds later to put the Mules up for good. The rest of the points were scored on free throws,
with Muhlenberg surviving a last-second three-point attempt.


Killing finished with 22 points, as did sophomore Jon Schreer, who topped his previous career best
of 18. Schreer (right) was 5-of-9 from three-point range.

Junior Alec Stavetski scored 14 points, while freshman Mitch Cohen pulled
down 10 rebounds in his collegiate debut.

In the women’s game, Muhlenberg started 0-for-13 from the field and fell behind 12-2 but clawed back into
the game and went up by as many as 15 early in the second half before hitting another dry spell.

The score was tied at 59 before sophomore Maggie Zerbe made one of two free throws with
37.1 seconds left.

It was still 60-59 when Moravian took a timeout with 5.2 seconds left. The Mules appeared to have the win when
junior Christina Santone blocked a layup attempt, but the ball came out to the wing and a
Greyhound shooter was fouled while attempting a three-pointer as the buzzer sounded.

The officials put three-tenths of a second back on the clock. Moravian missed the first free throw but made the second
and third, and Muhlenberg could not get a shot off.

Santone (left) finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds for her first career double-double, and senior Leanna Tallamy
also recorded a double-double (11 points, 14 rebounds). Zerbe, who scored a total of four points last year, 
had career highs of seven points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore Michelle Poole also flirted with a double-double, 
scoring a career-high nine points and pulling down eight rebounds.

Berg's Center for Ethics Presents Smithsonian Poster Exhibit, Earth From Space



The Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics will hold an opening reception for the Smithsonian poster exhibit, Earth from Space, on Thursday, September 16 at 4:30 p.m. in the Trexler Library.  


	 Wednesday, September 8, 2010  11:45 AM

The event is free and open to the public.  The exhibition runs until the end of the semester.
Earth from Space is a set of 20 posters that features images and text from the popular museum exhibition of the same name.  A colaboration with geographer and curator Andrew Jhonston at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum’s (NASM) Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, the traveling exhibit won a 2007 U.S. Geological Survey communication award for science content. 
 Featuring beautifully detailed satellite images of the planet from the swirling arms of a massive hurricane and the grid-like pattern of Kansas farmland to the triangular shadows cast by the Great Pyramids and the sinuous channels entering the Arctic Ocean, “Earth From Space” illustrates how satellite imagery is gathered and used to expand mankind’s understanding of life on Earth.
This exhibition is the first in a year-long series of events, Science and Sensibility: Studying Nature as a Human Endeavor, directed by Dr. Bruce Wightman, Professor of Biology.

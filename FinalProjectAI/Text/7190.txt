The Muhlenberg cross country teams both finished in the top 20 in an extremely competitive region at the NCAA Mideast Regional, which they hosted at Lehigh.



The Mule men came in 13th out of 54 teams, a two-place improvement from last year and their 15th consecutive season in the top 20. The women were 16th out of 52 teams, landing in the top 20 for the 16th time in 17 years.

Senior Nicki Cronin finished a career-best 20th in the women’s race to earn all-region honors for the third consecutive season. The third female in program history to make the all-region team three times, Cronin will earn a bid to the NCAA Championships if five Mideast teams are selected to run in the national meet.

Six weeks after competing on the same course at the Paul Short Run, many members of the men’s team showed great improvement in considerably better running conditions. Senior Bobby McGetrick (left) led the Mules by finishing 51st – halving his place from last year’s regional race – in a field of 354 runners. Sophomore Stephen Sroka, who was 220th at the 2012 regional, came in 61st. Junior Luke Munyan (63rd), freshman Jaryd Flank (83rd), senior Charlie Kline (109th), junior Kenny Wohl (146th) and senior Jarrett Felix (155th) rounded out the Mules’ top seven.

Following Cronin across the finish line in the women’s field of 358 runners were sophomores Melanie Tramontina (52nd) and Claire Thornton (113th), junior Chelsea Rivenbark (145th), seniors Ramzy Burns (157th), and Lauren Zakheim (178th) and freshman Hannah Binder (208th).

In the Matte Award competition, the Mules split with Moravian, with the men winning.

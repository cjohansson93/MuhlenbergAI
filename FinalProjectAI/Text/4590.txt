Soccer teams on opposite sidesof dramatic ties 


The Muhlenberg soccer teams both played teams from New York, one at home and one on the road. And both teams played ties in which the visiting team scored the equalizing goal late in regulation.

The mens team looked like it was on its way to its fourth straight 




OGradys goal was the 14th of her career.




win to start the season, taking a 1-0 lead against New York University into the final five minutes of regulation. The Mules (3-0-1) scored the goal 66 seconds into the second half when junior Cody Antonini collected a rebound of Danny Ways saved shot and slammed it into the upper right corner of the net.

NYU (2-1-1) scored the tying goal in stunning fashion with 3:53 showing on the clock after a long pass from the back found a forward

behind the Mule defense. The goal was the first allowed by the Mules this season.

Muhlenberg took the only two shots of overtime, but neither found the mark. Although the Mules had their winning streak snapped, they are undefeated 
after four games for the first time since 2005.

For the second straight game, the Muhlenberg women had to overcome an early deficit, as St. John Fisher scored just 1:31 after kickoff. The Cardinals eventually went up 2-0 early in the second half, but the Mules rallied to tie. Junior Meghan OGrady scored the first goal in the 60th minute, and with just 1:28 left, freshman CJ Graetzer put in a corner kick from sophomore Jillian Moretto to knot the score.

It was the first career goal for Graetzer and the first career point for Moretto.

Although the Mules (0-1-2) owned a 24-14 edge in shots for the game, Fisher had the advantage in overtime, taking four shots, but junior Michele Toher made a pair of saves to preserve the draw.

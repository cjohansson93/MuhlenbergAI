Muhlenberg College web guidelines and standards form the basis for achieving and maintaining uniformity and clarity throughout the College website. Individuals responsible for the creation and maintenance of web content must adhere to this criteria. The College standards facilitate the web design process, enhance usability and provide the means to build structurally and functionally sound websites, while insuring overall homogeneity of the College site.
For more information on how to request a web presence on the College site, go to Requesting Muhlenberg Web Presence Page. 
If you have questions related to the College web presence, feel free to contact the Webmaster, Jon Dymock.  
Muhlenberg College's style guide is designed for consistency across campus. Please contact Bill Keller in the office of communications with questions or concerns regarding the style guide.

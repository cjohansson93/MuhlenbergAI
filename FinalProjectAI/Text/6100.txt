Better Late Than Never: Carnevale Breaks School Record
 Friday, February 17, 2012







					 





Sophomore Jeff Reinhart finished third in the 200 meters.


Because of a highway closure, the Muhlenberg track and field teams arrived late for Haverford’s Keogh Invitational, their last competition before the Centennial Conference Championships.




Senior Melissa Miller tied for seventh in the pole vault.

The Mules missed the 4x200 relay and the mile, but in the first race in which they were able to compete, a school record fell. Sophomore Stephanie Carnevale won the 60-meter hurdles in 9.31 seconds, breaking the mark of 9.42 set in 2005. Her time is the third-fastest in the CC this season.

One other Muhlenberg runner won an event, senior Peter Rice in the 400. Rice lowered his CC-best 400 time to 49.77. (He ran 49.56 on a banked track last week; that converts to 50.06 on a flat track.)

A bunch of Mules posted second-place finishes, including sophomore Andrew Onimus, who lowered his best time in the 400; 
junior Samantha Mayden; who posted her best 800 time; senior Kyle Sullivan, whose high jump of 5-6 landed just outside the CC top 10; and junior Bre Biondi and senior Marc Brookland, who established season bests in the pole vault and triple jump, respectively.

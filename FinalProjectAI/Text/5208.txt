women’s tennis wins fourth straight



Women’s Lacrosse Streak Broken


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team had its six-game winning streak snapped with a 19-10 home loss to fourth-ranked Franklin & Marshall.

The Diplomats (11-1, 6-0), who have played in the Division III championship game the last two years and won 29 consecutive 

regular-season Centennial Conference games, ran off five straight goals late in the first half to increase their 6-3 lead to 11-3.

Junior Amanda McGovern and sophomore Danielle Rosen scored three goals apiece for the Mules (8-2, 4-2), who are still alone in third place in the CC. The 10 goals matched the most allowed this season by F&M, which entered the game second in the country in scoring defense.

Earlier in the day, senior Ruth Morrongiello (above) was named Division III offensive player of the week by WomensLacrosse.com for her performance in wins
against Dickinson and McDaniel.

Rotfeld has won six of her last seven singles matches.



The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team rolled into the holiday break with its fourth straight win, 7-2 at Dickinson.

At the halfway point of their Centennial Conference season, the Mules (5-3, 4-1) are in a virtual three-way tie for second place in the CC with Haverford (their next opponent) and Washington.

Sophomores Caitie Druker, Sara Sutker and Danielle Winston won at both doubles and singles, and all had to work for it. Druker and Sutker teamed up for a close 8-6 win at second doubles, and Druker came back after losing the first set in her No. 2 singles match.

Winston breezed in doubles, 8-1, but needed a first-set tiebreak at fifth singles.

Senior Carly Rotfeld won 6-1, 6-1 at No. 3 singles for her 80th career victory.

Trexler Library recognizes the complex and diverse needs of its patrons and is committed to acquiring the necessary materials to match those needs. The materials listed below are available to all current Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff. They can be checked out from the Lending Services Desk on A-Level. Note that these materials each have their own checkout period that is different from materials stored in our main collection. Patrons will be fined $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) for late returns, so please plan accordingly.
Anatomical Models
Trexler Library has several anatomical models on reserve for Muhlenberg patrons. Our current collection includes individual models for the Head, the Eye, the Ear, the Shoulder, the Larynx, the Hip, the Male Pelvis, the Female Pelvis, and the Circulatory System. Each of these models has multiple parts for easy manipulation.

Checkout Period: 1 Day
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 

Blu-ray/DVD Players
Many newer generation laptops no longer include a disc drive. Our external disc drives are compatible with both Mac and Windows computers, allowing patrons to view A/V discs on their devices.

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 
Note: These drives are not compatible with Chromebooks. 

Button Maker
The button maker comes with simple instructions and 50 metal buttons for you to install your own designs for any occasion.

Checkout Period: 3 Days 
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns.

Cell Phone Chargers
The Lending Services Desk has iPhone chargers (pre-iPhone 4 and post-iPhone 5), Type C USB chargers, and Android/Micro-USB chargers available for checkout. These items come with a charging cable and an outlet cube.

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 
Note: A phone charging station is located behind the Information Services Desk and is available for patrons to use. This station is not available for checkout and must stay behind the Information Services Desk when not in use.

Chromebooks
Four Chromebooks are available for checkout. These computers are 'frozenâ, so you cannot save personal files to the hard drive. Personal files will not be recovered after reboot. 

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 

Headphones
Headphones are available for checkout at the Lending Services Desk. These headphones can be used for personal devices as well as Trexler Libraryâs computers and A/V viewing stations. Patrons can also borrow headphone splitters in the event a group wishes to use a viewing station together.

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 

Laptop Security Cables
Trexler Library encourages patrons to keep their items secure, so laptop security cables are available for checkout from the Lending Services Desk. These cables are carbon-strengthened steel that can lock a patron's laptop to most tables in Trexler Library. 

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 

Presentation Remotes
Trexler Library offers presentation remotes to help students practice or record class presentations. They are connected via a wireless USB receiver that is stored inside the remote, and has a maximum range of 100-feet. The remotes are also equipped with a laser pointer and touch-keys that allow the user to control a slideshow.   

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns.

We have two USB-C hubs available for Muhlenberg patrons at the Lending Services Desk. These adaptors are equipped with seven ports, including two USB-A data ports, one USB-C charging port, one USB-C data port, one HDMI port, and slots for micro/macro SD cards. 

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns.

Webcams
Our Logitech Webcams can support 1080p widescreen video calling and recording. They are equipped with two microphones to capture natural stereo audio as well as autofocus to deliver clear images in consistent high definition. They are compatible with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, and Android devices. 

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns. 

Wireless Keyboards
Our wireless keyboards connect through a USB receiver, making them compatible with any device that includes a USB port or through the use of an adaptor (not included). 

Checkout Period: 4 Hours; In-Library Use Only
Fine: $0.25 per hour (or portion of an hour) will be accrued for late returns.

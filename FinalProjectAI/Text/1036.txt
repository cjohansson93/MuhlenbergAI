Welcome to the MILE Application Process.
 
MILE security deposit payment here
Living in MILE is a privilege at Muhlenberg College and should be treated with a great deal of responsibility. Before you consider MILE housing there is important information you need to be aware of. In order to complete the application on this web site you must first read through the information on the next few pages. The College maintains a close relationship with the local Muhlenberg Area Community Watch group so some of these materials have been provided by them. If you have any questions about these materials or the MILE process please contact Residential Services at (484)-664-3180

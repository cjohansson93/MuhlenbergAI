Hellings Good as Gold on Final Vault
 Friday, February 22, 2013 - page 3







					 



The Muhlenberg men’s track and field team got off to a great start at the Centennial Conference Indoor Track & Field Championships, with 
senior Ryan Hellings winning his first career gold medal in the pole vault in the only completed event of the first day.

The competition came down to three competitors, Hellings and athletes from Haverford and Johns Hopkins, at 13 feet, 11¼ inches. All three missed their
first two attempts, but Hellings (right) cleared his third and final try to set a new personal best. He then had to wait it out as the other two tried the height, and
when they missed, Hellings had his gold.

The gold medal was the first for the Muhlenberg men’s team in the pole vault since 2000.

Sophomore Jacob Miller-Sobel finished eighth in the vault to give the Mules 11 team points.

In the only women’s event of the first day, freshman Katrina Faust came in eighth in the pentathlon.

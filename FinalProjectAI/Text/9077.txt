JANUARY
Chris Cuomo lecture, ââThe Importance of Peace Politics in the Omnipresence of WarâJan. 27, 2 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum (Common Hour)
Focusing on how the omnipresence of war or and the preparation for war affects both the construction of gendered identity and the natural environment, Cuomo suggests it makes little sense to consider times of war as distinct from times of âpeace.â In her talk, Cuomo will assert that Just War theory, including feminist Just War theory, problematically obscures the way warfare has consequences even during times when combat isnât being waged.
Cuomo is a professor of philosophy and women's studies at the University of Georgia and an affiliate faculty member of the Environmental Ethics Certificate Program, the Institute for African-American Studies and the Institute for Native American Studies. The author and editor of articles and books in feminist, postcolonial and environmental philosophy, Cuomo served as director of the Institute for Women's Studies from 2006-2009. Her book, âThe Philosopher Queen,â a reflection on post-9/11 anti-war feminist politics, was nominated for a Lambda Award and an APA book award.
FEBRUARY
Mark Harris lecture, âIs War Propaganda Ever Good?: American Filmmaking During World War IIâFeb. 7, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum
Harris will examine how, after Pearl Harbor, Hollywood and Washington entered into an unprecedentedâand uncomfortableâpartnership in which the rules of war and the principles of news and entertainment were all bent for what was considered to be the greater good. Some of Hollywood's greatest directors of fiction were recruited to filmâand sometimes to restageâthe war, while the filmmakers who stayed in Hollywood were strongly encouraged to include government-approved talking points in their films. What were the lines separating documentaries from entertainment, facts from propaganda and information from what would now be called âfake newsâ?
Harris is best known as writer of âPictures at a Revolutionâ and âFive Came Back.â He is a former executive editor at Entertainment Weekly, and has written for a number of other top publications. Harris remains a columnist for Entertainment Weekly. In 2014, Harris published âFive Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War.â The work is an examination of five U.S. film directors and their frontline work during WWII. The New York Times called the book âa tough-minded, information-packed and irresistibly readable work.â
Brian Orend lectureFeb. 20, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum
Orend is the director of international studies and a professor of philosophy at the University of Waterloo in Canada. He is the author of six books, with two more forthcoming. His most acclaimed, and most widely-used, book is âThe Morality of War.â The updated second edition was released in Fall 2013, and has attracted expert praise for being âsplendidâ¦easily the most important work, in its field, in a generation.â
MARCH
Pete Giugni presentation and discussion, âHumanitarian Operations in Insecure EnvironmentsâMarch 14, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hall's Miller Forum
Giugni, Protection of Civilians Delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for the Regional Delegation of the United States and Canada, will give a brief presentation and be part of an open discussion that explores his experience of helping to facilitate humanitarian aid in multiple combat zones around the world. He joined the ICRC in 2004 and has worked in various protection and managerial roles in India (Kashmir), Afghanistan (Kandahar, Khost and Faryab), the Philippines (Mindanao) and Tajikistan (Dushanbe).
Michael Kazin lecture, âShould the U.S. Have Fought in World War OneâMarch 28, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum
Kazin will examine the debate over whether the U.S. should prepare for and then declare war on Imperial Germany, which was one of the most contentious and significant in American history. In the early spring of 1917, President Woodrow Wilson reluctantly sided with the pro-war party, and large majorities in Congress endorsed his stand. A century later, it is difficult to defend what they did.
Kazin is professor of history at Georgetown University and has been co-editor of âDissentâ since 2009. He is the award-winning author of âWar Against War: The American Fight for Peace, 1914-1918,â âAmerican Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nationâ and more. In addition, he is editor-in-chief of âThe Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History,â co-editor of the anthology âAmericanism,â and editor of âIn Search of Progressive America.â

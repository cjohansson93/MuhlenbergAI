Education
B.S. Biology, summa cum laude, College of William and Mary M.A. Molecular Biology, Princeton University Ph.D. Molecular Biology, Princeton University Postdoctoral research, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University
Courses Taught Concepts of Biology: Genes, Genomics, and Society (BIO 118) Wearing Our Genes: DNA and Determinism (BIO 283) Principles of Biology III: Cells and Molecules (BIO 152) Biochemistry (BIO 220) Genomes and Gene Evolution (BIO 472) Foods, Broods, and Moods: The Impact of Genetics on Society (FYS 236)
Research InterestsMy scientific interests focus on the regulation of gene function; in particular, I am interested in how factors such as packaging of DNA into chromatin and organization of genes within genomes  may affect gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Students in my lab are currently engaged in a comparative genomics project that uses in silico (computer-based) analysis to annotate genes in Drosophila species, a collaborative effort of the Genomics Education Partnership (thegep.org). Past and future projects include studying the role of chromatin structure and other epigenetic mechanisms  in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and DNA barcoding work in collaboration with Dr. Lara Goudsouzian at DeSales University

The Muhlenberg Art Department was founded in 1953 by internationally famous sculptor George Rickey. In the decades since, art at Muhlenberg has expanded with an interdisciplinary, interactive and international focus. Our rigorous visual arts curriculum is built on a foundation made strong by Muhlenbergâs broad-based liberal arts programming.
Students may pursue majors and minors in both studio art and art history, and diverse course offerings offer preparation for not only M.F.A. and Ph.D. programs around the nation and world, but for success in fields as varied as art education, publication editing and design, medical illustration, medicine and law.

Sculpture Professor Frederick Wright Jones consults with a student in a studio art class. Our faculty exhibit nationwide, and their own experiences provide insight for students who wish to pursue careers in artistic fields.



 











Studio major Tongyao Su works on a drawing outside of the Center for the Arts. Students have access to a range of facilities housed in the Center for the Arts. The departmentâs low faculty-to-student ratio ensures that students receive the best of both worldsâindividualized attention with the freedom to take the lead in exploring personal creative interests.




 











Students examine prints from the Collegeâs archives as part of an integrative learning course with faculty from Muhlenbergâs History Department. Our curriculum approaches art with an interdisciplinary, interactive and international lens. 



 











Muhlenberg students view an exhibition by senior studio art majors in our very own Martin Art Gallery. The gallery also shows high quality work by local, national, and international artists. In addition, students have access to dozens of exhibits, lectures, and internships at the nearby Allentown Art Museum and local colleges. The world-class museums and galleries of New York and Philadelphia are within one to two hours.



 











Ana Negron exhibits her final thesis in sculpture. Students choose an area of concentration, while receiving a broad foundation in studio arts and art history and by complementing their majors or minors with courses in other disciplines. 



 











Katherine Boll discusses her thesis project with classmates in the Martin Gallery during an exhibition. We believe that our students should have access to as many resources as possible in order to foster their personal, academic, and artistic growth.

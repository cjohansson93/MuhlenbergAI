Women's Soccer Edges Franklin & Marshall

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team assured itself at least a .500 Centennial Conference record with a 2-1 win over 
Franklin & Marshall. The Mules’ 5-5 record last season was good enough to clinch a playoff berth, and their third
straight win keeps them in fourth place in the conference with two weeks to go in the regular season.

The win itself was a well-fought decision, and the game-winning goal was sensational. 
Senior Colleen Touhey, who deposited the first goal, bicycle kicked a ball right to 
sophomore Abby Lazofsky, who elevated to volley in the goal from point-blank range in the 61st minute.

Lazofsky has made her two goals count this season. The sophomore headed in the game-winner in overtime against 
McDaniel to give the Mules (9-3-2, 5-2) their best start in program history.

Touhey started the scoring in the first half with a beautiful strike in the 14th minute. The senior collected a 
deflected pass at the top of the box and lofted a shot into the back of the net. Touhey controlled most of the 
action in the midfield and her ball awareness led to the magnificent assist on the second goal. 

Muhlenberg sealed the victory with a little help from its friend the crossbar, which turned away two second-half strikes 
by the Diplomats (1-12, 0-7). Despite being down a couple of key defensive players, Muhlenberg’s back line 
held tough in the second half. 

Junior Megan Nehila, a midfielder who started in the back for an injured Mule, saw most of the action 
in the second half, 
with the Diplomats attacking down the left side of Muhlenberg’s defensive territory. The junior was able to 
clear the ball and take away possession on multiple occasions, leading the defensive effort that finished off the win. 

The win is key for Muhlenberg heading into next week’s road matchups against regionally ranked Swarthmore and 
Gettysburg.

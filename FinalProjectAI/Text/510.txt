For the first time in over a decade, Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is hosting an exhibition of faculty work. Works by teaching artists and researchers in painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and other media will be on display. Examples of their work will be shown along side information about their teaching philosophies and personal motivations for their creative work. The show will open with an public opening reception on November 17th, from 6 - 7:30pm (masks will be required of all visitors).
This expansive show will feature works by the full Art and Art History faculty bodies, including Raymond Barnes, Greta Bergstresser, Les Fletcher, David Haas, Carol Heft, Margo Hobbs, Kim Hoeckele, Frederick Wright Jones, Dawn Kramlich, Emily Orzech, Yangbin Park, Elena FitzPatrick Sifford, and Kevin Tuttle.

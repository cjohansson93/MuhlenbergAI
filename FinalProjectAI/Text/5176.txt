Track teams ready for conferences



Baseball Falls in Butz Classic


Two baseball teams that were 



Seniors Mike Misciagna (above) and Matthew Ordog combined to allow only one earned run and strike out seven in eight innings of relief.



disappointed not to make their conference playoffs put on a playoff-like game under the lights, with DeSales scoring two unearned runs in the top of the 10th to beat Muhlenberg, 9-7, in the Alvin H. Butz, Inc. Lehigh Valley College Baseball Showcase at Coca-Cola Park.

The Mules (15-22-1) rallied from a 7-1 deficit in the last four innings to force extra innings.

Senior Christian Conti played a big role in the comeback, hitting two doubles to become Muhlenberg’s all-time leader with 55 career extra-base hits. He drove in the tying run with a forceout in the bottom of the ninth, beating the relay throw to first to avert what would have been a game-ending double play. Conti eventually made it around to third and nearly scored on what would have been the extremely rare “walkoff strikeout.” The ball bounced away on the third strike, and the catcher touched home plate just ahead of Conti.

Sophomore Bobby Spindler also hit two doubles for the second time in three games. Senior Edward Risener extended his hitting streak to 12 games by going 3-for-5. Senior John Kalis had two hits and drove in a pair of runs.

The Muhlenberg track and field teams are as ready as they 

can be for the Centennial Conference Championships after a final tuneup at the Lehigh Games on Saturday.

The men’s 4x100 relay team of juniors Brendan Kirk and William Ryan, freshman Peter Rice and junior Jeremiah Lachaud broke the school record yesterday, running 43.30.
 
Rice had an outstanding day, as he not only ran on the winning 4x100, but also won the 200 and the 400, running the second-fastest 400 (49.90) in school history. Rice and fellow freshman Marc Brookland (triple jump) also qualified for the ECAC Championships.

The men’s team had a total of five first-place finishes (Lachaud (right) in the 100, Rice in the 200 and 400, sophomore Bobby Torphy in the 800 and the 4x100).

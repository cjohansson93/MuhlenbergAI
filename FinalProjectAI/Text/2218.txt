FACULTY UPDATE: Matt Moore Assistant Professor of Theatre Matt Moore is co-editor of the book Troubling Traditions: Canonicity, Theatre, and Performance in the US, published Nov. 30, 2021, by Routledge. Troubling Traditions takes up a 21st century, field-specific conversation between scholars, educators, and artists from varying generational, geographical, and identity positions that speak to the wide array of debates around dramatic canons.    Unlike Literature and other fields in the humanities, Theatre and Performance Studies has not yet fully grappled with the problems of its canon. Troubling Traditions stages that conversation in relation to the canon in the United States. It investigates the possibilities for multiplying canons, methodologies for challenging canon formation, and the role of adaptation and practice in rethinking the fieldâs relation to established texts. The conversations put forward by this book on the canon interrogate the fieldâs fundamental values, and ask how to expand the voices, forms, and bodies that constitute this discipline. Read more.

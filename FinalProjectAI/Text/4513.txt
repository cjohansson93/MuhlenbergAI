T.D. times three:Dandridge runs Mules past Devils


Sophomore Terrence Dandridge lived up to his initials three times, rushing for a career-high 191 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Muhlenberg football team to an important 26-13 win at Dickinson.

The win, combined with Ursinus 24-17 loss at Moravian, put the Mules (6-2, 6-1) back into a tie for first place in the Centennial Conference with Ursinus. The two tied teams meet in Allentown next Saturday in a showdown for first place.

Senior guard Mark Bigelli leads the way for sophomore Dan Deighan on a third-quarter run. The offensive line helped the Mules average 5.5 yards per

sluggish start. The Red Devils (2-6, 2-5) drove inside the Mule 20-yard line on their first two possessions but came away with no points. They missed a short field goal on their first drive, and junior Kevin Ryan picked off a pass near the end zone to end the second.

Dickinson finally got on the board with a touchdown early in the second quarter, and at that point the Red Devils had outgained the Mules, 147-47. But as Muhlenberg learned last week in its loss to Franklin & Marshall, not taking advantage of a big edge in yards early in the game can come back to haunt a team.

quarter, aided by a late hit penalty on Dickinson after a failed third-down conversion. Two plays later, Dandridge scored on a 20-yard run with 5:04 left in the first half to tie up the game.

Muhlenberg tried an onside kick following the touchdown, and junior linebacker Matt Musick recovered, setting up a 22-yard go-ahead field goal by senior Michael Katz with 26 seconds on the clock. 

The Mules began to take control of the game in the third quarter. Dandridge capped a 9-play, 53-yard drive with a 1-yard run midway through the third, and Katz added a 32-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter. The two field goals gave Katz 27 for his career, tying the school record set by Bob Powers (1988-90).

A 9-yard touchdown run by Dickinsons relief quarterback with about 10 minutes left ended the 20-0 Muhlenberg run, but Musick blocked the extra point to keep the gap at seven. 

Muhlenberg took over at its own 35 with 4:14 left and had a third-and-3 at the Dickinson 48 with less than a minute to play, needing a first down to clinch the game. Dandridge got it and more, bouncing to the outside and running a career-best 48 yards for his third touchdown.

Our lineman were really holding their blocks today, said Dandridge, who topped the 100-yard mark for the sixth game in a row. So when I got the ball I could just look down field because I knew they were going to get the job done up front.


Senior Patrick McDonough led the Mule defense with 13 tackles. He made a touchdown-saving tackle after a 42-yard run in the first quarter and tackle for a 3-yard loss with Dickinson driving for a potential game-tying score in the fourth.

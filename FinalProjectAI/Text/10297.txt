In her role as chief medical officer for Stanford Blood Center in California, Dr. Suchi Pandey â99 must ensure that the blood the Center collects is safe for transfusion patients to receive. When COVID-19 first emerged early this year, her first concern was, âCould this novel coronavirus be bloodborne?â (Fortunately, there has been no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through transfusion.) Her next concern was ensuring the safety of donors and staff at a time when personal protective equipment shortages were making headlines. Then, she quickly took on the responsibility of building the Centerâs convalescent plasma program.
âEarly on, it was determined that a potential investigational treatment could be convalescent plasma [collected from patients whoâve recovered from COVID-19]. It has been used in other respiratory illnesses, but thereâs never been a very strong clinical trial,â says Pandey, who was a biology major at Muhlenberg. âThe concept makes sense: If you take plasma from somebody with high levels of antibodies against the virus and give it to someone whoâs currently ill, those antibodies can help in fighting the virus.â
Pandey, whoâs also a clinical associate professor of pathology at Stanford University, received her first request for convalescent plasma from a California hospital on April 5, and on April 7, Stanford Blood Center conducted its first collection.
âWe were one of the first programs in the country to bring up our convalescent plasma program,â she says. âIt was a tremendous amount of work to set up procedures, train the staff and get everything ready.â

In the spring and summer, Pandey also worked directly with COVID-19 patients at Stanford Hospital receiving convalescent plasma as part of a national expanded access protocol run by the Mayo Clinic to gauge the experimental treatmentâs safety. That protocol ended August 23, when the FDA granted convalescent plasma an emergency-use authorizationâthe Mayo Clinicâs program produced enough data (via the 106,000 patients nationwide it enrolled) for the FDA to determine the treatment was not harmful.
âIt was really interesting to be involved in the protocol on the hospital side: talking about it with patients who consented to it and tracking how they did,â Pandey says. But, she points out, itâs clinical trialsâwhich have a group of patients receiving convalescent plasma treatment and another group receiving a placeboâthat will actually tell the medical community if the treatment is effective. 
Several clinical trials are ongoing. Stanford is leading one comparing the treatment against a placebo in COVID-19 patients who visit the emergency room but are not sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. Another large, multi-site clinical trial is evaluating convalescent plasma treatment in patients who are hospitalized but not intubated. Another trial, coordinated by Johns Hopkins, is examining convalescent plasma as a preventative treatment for people who arenât currently sick but whoâve had a high-risk exposure to a COVID-positive individual.
âWe donât have data from any of these yet. Theyâre still enrolling patients. But these trials are needed to tell us if convalescent plasma works in these different settings,â Pandey says.
Between the clinical trials, the FDAâs emergency-use authorization and the rise in COVID-19 cases, national demand for convalescent plasma is increasing. Pandey continues to work to collect it while simultaneously ensuring the Blood Center has adequate reserves of blood for the hospitals it servesâno small feat in an era when many of the schools and workplaces that would ordinarily hold blood drives are operating remotely due to the pandemic.
Pandey talks with a convalescent plasma donor.
Pandey is grateful for the California Department of Public Healthâs (CDPH) partnership with blood centers to increase convalescent plasma collections in the state. CDPH sends letters to each positive patient in its database, making them aware that once theyâre fully recovered, they can consider donating their plasma to potentially help others. That letter also serves as proof that the prospective donor had a positive test, which helps blood banks like Pandeyâs be sure that theyâll be able to collect convalescent plasma from the donor.
âAny blood donor is incredible. Theyâre giving their time to donate their blood to help someone else,â Pandey says. âWhat makes this unique is there are not a lot of scenarios where someone who is recovered from an illness can give a product that can help someone who is currently sick with that same illness. We have donors who have come back six or seven times to donate their plasma.â

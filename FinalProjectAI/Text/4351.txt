Wrestling seniors recognized



Even though the final home match of the season against Scranton was cancelled, senior night still went on as scheduled for the Muhlenberg wrestling team.

The match, which had been rescheduled from earlier in the season because of snow, was called off because of a Scranton emergency.

While seniors Keith Swanson, Bill Sholly and Michael Slevin were not able to take the mat one last time in Memorial Hall, they were still honored for their hard work and dedication to the program.

In spite of a pair of late rallies, the Muhlenberg volleyball team was swept in its home opener by undefeated Elizabethtown.

The Mules (1-4) were down to their final point in the first set, trailing 24-20, before going on a 5-0 run to take the lead. 
The Blue Jays (4-0), however, repsonded with the next three points to win, 27-25.

In the second set, Muhlenberg was down 18-14, came back to tie it at 19 and eventually took a 22-21 lead. But again Elizabethtown finished strong,
rolling off the final four points of the set for a 25-22 win. The Blue Jays went on to take the third set, 25-17.

Senior Phylicia Lee led the Muhlenberg attack with 9 kills and added 18 digs. Senior Christina Cangelosi recorded a match-high 22 digs, and
sophomore Davi Gordon contributed 16.

Sophomore Jackie Price (right) chipped in with 5 kills and 4 blocks.

Kristine Yahna Todaro
Director of News & Media Relationskristinetodaro@muhlenberg.edu484-664-4343Twitter: @MuhlenbergNews
Kristine Todaro, an '84 Muhlenberg alumna, is on campus to help find the Collegeâs most compelling stories and share them far and wide through her role as the director of news & media relations.
In past professional lives, Kristine has handled national and regional media relations, integrated marketing, digital communications and community relations in both higher education (Lafayette College, Reed College and Moravian College) and corporate (Rodale Press) environments.
An English major (who can still quote passages from Chaucerâs Canterbury Tales) and communications minor, Kristine lives in Allentown with her partner, Mike Pennella, their blended family of four kids and Arlo, the worldâs sweetest rescue beagle/lab.

Women's Tennis Cruises Past Ursinus on Senior Day
 Wednesday, April 11, 2012







					 

 Women’s lacrosse


The wait may have been long, but it was definitely worth it for Emily Robbins of the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team. And she wasn’t going to let a little rain ruin the day.

Playing in the first dual match of her career, the senior helped the Mules sweep through doubles play en route to an 8-1 win over Ursinus (4-11, 0-7) on Senior Day.




Robbins (left) and fellow senior Lauren Wink were honored during a ceremony before the match. And while Wink, who has not been able to practice much this season because she is student teaching, did not play, Robbins carried the senior torch in a match that had to be moved indoors when a rain shower popped up just before play was set to begin.

She teamed with junior Amanda von Taube to win the first five games and pick up an 8-2 win at No. 3 doubles.

“It felt really good to get a win at doubles,” Robbins said. “I’m glad I got to play with Amanda; she played really well and helped me play better.”

Sophomores Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman won 8-4 at No. 1 and freshman Jennifer Goldberg and sophomore Gabriela Contino picked up an 8-5 win at No. 2 to give the Mules a 3-0 lead heading to singles play.

And they took full advantage of the opportunity, sweeping the first three singles matches in straight sets to clinch the win. Sanders and Goldberg only dropped three games apiece in their wins at Nos. 1 and 3, and Szulman took her match at No. 3, 6-4, 6-1.

With the victory sealed, the final three matches were played as first to eight pro sets, with freshman Sharen Resnikoff winning 8-4 at No. 4 and Contino capturing her second straight singles match, 8-5, at No. 5.

With their wins, Szulman, Goldberg and Resnikoff all improved to 5-1 in Centennial Conference play.

And while Robbins dropped her singles match, she said it was still a great feeling to be out on the court after cheering her teammates on for the past three seasons. And getting a big conference win was the perfect way to end Senior Day. 

 “It was great to be able to finally play, especially with my family here.” Robbins said. “I’m really glad I was able to help us win.”

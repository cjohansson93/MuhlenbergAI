The rich tradition of student research at Muhlenberg College is showcased by student presentation. Student researchers present posters and give seminars on campus at an annual poster session and within departments. Students also travel off-campus to present their scholarly work to their respective disciplinary communities at regional, national and international conferences. 
If you are a student preparing to present your research on or off-campus, please consult the page of Presentation Templates for guidelines on preparing your presentation.

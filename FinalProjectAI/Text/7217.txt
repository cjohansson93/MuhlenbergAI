Silver, Seven Bronzes for Track & Field Teams at CC Meet
 Sunday, March 2, 2014 - page 2







					 



Stephanie Carnevale thought her bid for a repeat gold medal in the 60-meter hurdles at the Centennial Conference Indoor Track & Field Championships was over almost before it began. 




Senior Jake Ullmann, competing at a CC meet for the first time since 2012 after missing all of last year with an injury, was part of two
place-winning relay teams: the 4x400 (fifth) and the 4x200 (seventh).



The senior had pulled up after clearing a single hurdle, a strange turn of events in what was expected to be one of the meet’s most electrifying races.

“I thought I blew it,” Carnevale confessed.

Not so fast.

As it turns out, Carnevale had a reason for her abrupt detour. A person staffing the event was tending to the sand pit after the long jump and made a raking motion right next to Carnevale as she passed in Lane 2. Thinking Carnevale had been startled by the sudden movement, Mules coach Brad Hackett came to the meet referee with a protest. The official judged the complaint to be justified. Just like that, Carnevale had new life.




Sahl won a bronze medal indoors with the 4x800 for the second year in a row.



“It all happened so fast,” said Carnevale. “I didn’t really have any idea what happened, but I guess they reviewed it and decided to give me another chance.”

Carnevale took full advantage. Though unable to defend her crown, she still managed to shake off the shock and confusion to finish third, one of several impressive performances by Muhlenberg athletes at Haverford. The Mule women placed fourth, while the men came in sixth for a second straight season.

Prior to the strange turn of events, Carnevale had been eagerly anticipating a showdown with Ursinus’ Victoria Goodenough – who she edged by seven hundredths of a second to claim gold and a meet record a year ago – and Gettysburg’s Katherine Cavanaugh, two of Division III’s best. Instead, Carnevale’s re-run was a solo act. Racing by herself, the All-American finished in an ECAC-qualifying 9.24 seconds, .16 ticks behind her top competitors. In addition to the relief of a second chance, Carnevale’s day had another silver lining: her mark of 8.85 seconds still stands as the best in meet history. 

“I really wanted to run with them,” Carnevale said. “The three of us always bring out the best in each other, and it’s always great to go up against them, but I guess they decided I should do it alone. I’m just glad I got a second chance. Everything turned out just fine.”

The bronze medal was one of seven earned by the Mules in the meet, and one of two for Carnevale, who also took third in the 60-meter dash. The top performance of the day, impressively, went to a newbie – junior Cody Geyer, who joined the team in the fall after an all-conference season as a wide receiver on the Muhlenberg football team, was second in the 60-meter dash. His time of 7.13 seconds in prelims was a mere two hundredths of a second off the school record.

Other Mule bronzes went to: sophomores Daniel Cano (shot put) and Brandon Tauber (high jump), freshman Jacqueline Jones (high jump), senior Erin Saucier (pole vault), and the team of senior Nicki Cronin, juniors Chelsea Rivenbark and Cassiah Sahl and sophomore Melanie Tramontina in the 4x800-meter relay.

Muhlenberg had four ECAC qualifiers on the day. In addition to Carnevale, classmate and fellow hurdler Amber Lee Wojtkowski also accomplished the feat with a personal best of 9.35 seconds, good for fifth in the event and second on Muhlenberg’s all-time performance list. Cronin qualified with her third consecutive fifth-place showing and a personal best in the mile, and the quartet of Sahl, Tramontina, Lauren Zakheim and Kimberly McCarty did so after taking fourth in the distance medley relay.

Freshman Claudia Theriault matched Saucier by clearing 9-6¼ in the pole vault, good for a fourth-place finish. 
Sophomore Claire Thornton placed fifth in the mile and ran the first leg of the fourth-place 4x400-meter relay team, 
and classmate Katrina Faust placed in the 60-meter hurdles (seventh), high jump (sixth) and pole vault (sixth).

Senior Scott Reutter placed fourth in the heptathlon with a score of 3,863 points, 374 higher than the standard he set last year
when he was the first Mule to compete in the event. Reutter also was seventh in the 60-meter hurdles, jumping to third on the performance list
with a time of 9.17 seconds.

Miller Leads Women's Soccer to a Win of a Different Color
 Saturday, September 17, 2011 - page 2







					 


Who says blondes have more fun?

Last week, at the urging of her friends, Nicolette Miller dyed her hair brownish-black. And in the Homecoming finale, she colored the net with goals, scoring three for her second career hat trick and leading the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team to a 4-0 win against McDaniel.

Miller, who notched her first hat trick last year against Franklin & Marshall (in another 4-0 win), is the sixth player in team history to notch multiple hat tricks. History does not note 



if she is the first to do it with two different hair colors.

In addition to giving the Mules (4-2 overall) a win in their Centennial Conference opener, the result was a nice bounceback 
after Wednesday’s 5-0 loss to top-ranked Messiah.

“We had a little fire from that game, because we weren’t happy with it,” said Miller.

Muhlenberg came out firing on all cylinders and didn’t let up, outshooting the Green Terror 26-4, with all of the visitor’s shots coming from distance. 

Miller opened the scoring just 3:38 into the game off a corner kick. The McDaniel goalie punched the corner kick away but could not clear it out of the box. Miller’s first shot was blocked, but the rebound came back to her and she found an open spot in the net (right) to give the Mules an early lead.

Later in the half, Miller spun around her defender on the endline (left) to get a 1-vs.-1 with the 




goalie. She finished high to make it 2-0.

The pair of goals in the first half made Miller the third different Mule in the last four games to net two goals. Unlike the first two, she was able to complete her hat trick.

“It’s definitely in the back of your mind,” said Miller of getting a hat trick. “But it’s more that we want to put them away with as many goals as we can, so it’s more we want to score as a team than me scoring.”

Good teamwork resulted in Miller scoring her third goal. Senior Meghan O’Grady made a run down the right side and crossed the ball through the box after her defender fell. Miller poked the ball into the net for her 29th career goal, tying her for sixth on the team’s all-time list.

Freshman Audrey Zamichow closed out the scoring with 11:15 to play after making a spin move similar to Miller’s to get to the goalie. Her shot was saved, but in the scramble for the rebound, the goalie took down Zamichow, resulting in a penalty kick.

The win puts Muhlenberg on the right track as it heads into a crucial week in which it faces two 2010 CC playoff teams in Haverford and Johns Hopkins.

“It was our first conference game, so we had to get that win,” said Miller.

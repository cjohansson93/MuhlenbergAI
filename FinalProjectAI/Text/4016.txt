womens lacrosse wins third straight in convincing fashion 





With two ground balls against Bryn Mawr, senior Lauren DeCarle has now picked up 100 ground balls during her Mule career.



As if there was any need for added motivation, the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team got plenty of it when it got off the bus for its game against Bryn Mawr.

Because of forecasted heavy rains, the game had been pushed up a day and moved to the turf field at Haverford. The same field where the Mules had dropped a tough CC game two weeks ago. So when they walked past the field and saw the Fords practicing, the entire team thought back to that game and got angry, according to senior Maggie Sullivan. 

So even though Bryn Mawr (5-8, 0-8) jumped out to an early lead, it was no surprise that the Mules responded quickly, rattling off six straight goals in a five-minute span to take control before eventually dispatching the Owls, 20-9.  

A couple people expressed that they werent too happy about being on that field and seeing them out there practicing, Sullivan said. So I think that may have just fired us up even more.

The victory extends Muhlenbergs winning streak to three games and keeps hope of a conference playoff berth alive. Currently sitting in sixth place, one spot out of the playoffs, the Mules have two more games against Dickinson (2-4 in CC play) and Ursinus, which currently sits in the fourth spot.
 
Bryn Mawr took a 1-0 lead less than five minutes in, but senior Danielle Rosen and junior Jessica Shegoski responded with two goals in less than a minute to give the Mules their first lead.

The Owls tied it with 22:38 to play in the first half before Muhlenberg (7-6, 3-4) went on a 6-0 run to pull in front 8-2. The Mules also scored the last four goals of the half to go into the locker room with a 15-5 advantage.

Rosen led the Mules with five goals and seven points, all of which came in the first half, while junior Angela Napoletano


Softball, Women's Tennis Lose to Ranked Foes


The hot bats of the Muhlenberg softball team were cooled off by 17th-ranked Moravian. A day after scoring 18 runs and belting four home runs in a sweep of Franklin & Marshall, the Mules (17-12) were held to six hits and lost both games of a doubleheader, 5-1 and 8-0.

Senior Ashley Brewer had a hit in each game, and senior Jess Kasza drove in the lone Muhlenberg run.

The sweep narrowed Muhlenberg's Matte Award lead to 8-5 with three events remaining: men's and women's track and field on Sunday and men's golf next Thursday.

and senior Christine Van Hise scored four and three goals, respectively.

It was the 29th hat trick of Rosens career, tied for the second-most in Mule history. 

Sullivan, who had scored three goals during her entire Mule career, registered her first multiple-goal game by finding the back of the net twice.

With the game well in hand, the Mules cruised after the break. Freshman Ally Shaffer and Meg Reilly picked up the first goals of their careers, and Muhlenberg limited Bryn Mawr to just eight shots during the second half.

While the playoffs dont officially start until April 27, Sullivan said the Mules have been in the postseason mindset for the past week. And while they may not have been tested against the Owls, she said the Mules are playing much sharper and are starting to peak at just the right time.

When we talked before the McDaniel game, we said that every remaining game is a playoff game, and we had to win them all, Sullivan said. So far were 3-0, and now we just need to keep this momentum going.

We know both of those teams [Dickinson and Ursinus] are really good. They also both beat us last year, so theres some extra motivation for us because we want revenge. Were playing with a sense of urgency and are prepared to do whatever we need to do to win our last two games and make the playoffs.

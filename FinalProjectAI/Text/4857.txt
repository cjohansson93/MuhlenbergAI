Doubles sweep propels women’s tennis



Softball Swept in Home Opener


The Muhlenberg softball team could not get its offense going and was shut out twice by Drew, 3-0 and 1-0, in its first home doubleheader of the season.

The Mules (4-5), who came in with a three-game winning streak in which they scored 23 runs, managed only six hits in the two games.

Muhlenberg’s best chance to score came in the bottom of the seventh inning of Game 2 after loading the bases with nobody out on a walk, error and bunt single by freshman Angie Sisco. But the Mules could not push the tying run across, as the next three batters were retired on a strikeout and two groundouts.

Junior Alyssa Bruckner was the tough-luck loser in the nightcap, allowing just five hits and the one run.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team won three close doubles matches and went on to defeat Moravian, 5-3, for its first win of the season.

Combined with the baseball win just across the path, the victory on the courts gave Muhlenberg a 9-2 lead in the Matte Award standings for the 2009-10 season. The
Mules have clinched a tie and need to win only one of the remaining seven contests to claim the trophy outright.

Two of the three doubles matches were decided by 8-6 finals, and the third was 8-8 before the Muhlenberg team of juniors Danielle Winston and 
Lindsay Schmidt won 7-5 in the tiebreaker. Winston, who has a habit of playing long matches, won a 7-5 tiebreaker in her first set at No. 3 singles before
the match was called due to darkness.

Juniors Chelsey Waldron (right) and Deniz Uzel teamed up for their first win together at No. 3 doubles. At No. 6 singles, Uzel came back
to win the second set, although she lost the supertiebreaker.

Schmidt and junior Caitie Druker, the Mules’ No. 1 player, won at both doubles and singles.

football blocked by F&M





Dandridge found the end zone for the third straight game with this 8-yard scoring run in the first quarter, capping an impressive 99-yard drive.



For the first time in conference play, the Muhlenberg football team did not win the battle of special teams.

And the result was the Mules' first Centennial Conference loss of the season, 17-7 to Franklin & Marshall.

Although the Mules ran 16 more plays and outgained the Diplomats by more than 140 yards, F&M used a pair of blocked punts to overcome an early deficit.

With Muhlenberg's starting punter sidelined with an injury, F&M went after a Mule punt early in the second quarter. The Diplomats 




Junior Chris Hartzell intercepted a pass on F&M's fourth play from scrimmage and led the Mules with 10 tackles. He also forced a fumble.




blocked the punt and took over at the Muhlenberg 34-yard line. 
But the Mule defense held and limited F&M to only a field goal.

Muhlenberg (5-2, 5-1) went into halftime clinging to a 7-3 lead and received the second-half kickoff. But the Mules went three-and-out and lined up to punt from their own 15-yard line.

That's when the Diplomats (5-2, 4-2) struck again. And Muhlenberg's 

defense was never given an opportunity to keep F&M off the scoreboard because the Diplomats fell on the ball in the end zone for what 
would prove to be the game-winning touchdown.

Muhlenberg drove into F&M territory on four of its last five possessions but could not put any points on the board.

Terrence Dandridge rushed for 140 yards, tying the career high he set last week, and a touchdown. The sophomore running back also became the first Mule since 2008 to surpass 100 yards rushing in 
five straight games.

Isaiah Vaughn, Jon Liberty and Bobby Bushong finished with five catches apiece, while sophomore Eric Gilbert picked up 35 yards on the first catch of his career.

Seniors Mark Accomando and Patrick McDonough each recorded nine tackles and half of a sack for a defense that held the CC leader in pass efficiency to 121 yards on 25 passes.

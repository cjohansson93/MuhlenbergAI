Muhlenberg fell behind early to Johns Hopkins and suffered its first Centennial Conference loss of the
season, 4-1.

The Blue Jays, ranked seventh in Division III, scored just 1:53 into the game and added a second goal midway through the first half. The Mules (10-4, 6-1) halved the
gap when sophomore Nicki Notarianni scored with 17:43 to play, but two late Hopkins goals put the game away.

Junior Michelle Consiglio made a career-high 11 saves in the loss.

Women’s Soccer


Muhlenberg led for almost two-thirds of the game, but Johns Hopkins scored three times in a 15-minute span to hand the Mules their second straight loss, 3-1.

Sophomore Kasey Hacker converted a pass from her twin sister Kimberly at the 15-minute mark to give Muhlenberg (6-4-3, 3-2-1) a  1-0 lead. Despite a 
barrage of Blue Jay shots, the advantage stood up until 17:10 remained. Hopkins scored again in less than three minutes and later added an insurance goal.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team has a flair for the dramatic when it plays McDaniel, although this year it didn’t need to be so dramatic.

Senior Jonathan Kliewer scored with 6:16 remaining to give the Mules a 1-0 win. Last year, Muhlenberg scored with five seconds left to beat the Green Terror by
the same score.

The Mules (8-3, 4-2) held a 23-5 advantage in shots, but were unable to get on the board until the final minutes, when Kliewer struck a 15-yard shot inside the far post for 
his first goal of the season.

“It was frustrating up until we scored,” said Kliewer, who started at midfield for the first time this year. “To finally get the ball in goal was just a big relief.”

Muhlenberg created a host of chances in the first half, but was denied by the Green Terror goalkeeper and, in Karim Assous’ case, the left post. 
However, the Mules also weathered several McDaniel counterattacks, with sophomore back Samuel Hayden making a sliding clearance off the goal line in the 
32nd minute to deny the visitors on their best scoring chance of the game.

Muhlenberg hasn’t allowed a goal to McDaniel since 2001 and hasn’t conceded a goal to its last three opponents this year. The Mules have seven shutouts in
11 games.

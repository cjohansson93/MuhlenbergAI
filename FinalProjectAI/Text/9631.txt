In a conference room 39 floors above Manhattanâs Sixth Avenue, with a wall of windows offering a sweeping view of Central Park, Doug Peebles '87 has a message for the 12 visiting Muhlenberg students: If you dislike your job, neither a fancy office nor a huge paycheck will make the struggle worthwhile.
âYouâve been happy in your life and youâve been miserable. Which is better?â Peebles asks. âWhen you were happy, did you care if you had $100 in your pocket or $10? No.â
The message might seem out of place within the confines of AllianceBernstein (AB), an asset management company where the goal is to turn one amount of money into a larger amount of money. It might seem especially odd coming from one of the partners there who is also the chief investment officer of AB Fixed Income. But Peebles, a Muhlenberg College Trustee, stresses repeatedly that his long, successful career is a product of enjoying what he does.
âYou have to like what you do so youâll work hard enough to be better than average,â Peebles says. âBefore you know it, youâre 52 years old and youâve been at the same place for 30 years.â
AB was one of six organizations students had the opportunity to visit in New York City during the Career Centerâs second annual Career Road Trip on September 26. Each organization had its own itinerary; at AB, the dayâs agenda consisted of a lunch with Peebles and Ian de Ruiter '13 (a regional consultant at AB), a panel with three young alumni employees (Katie Seeman '15, Mike Rus '12 and Jason Mertz '15), a panel with three more senior employees and a Q&A with a member of the companyâs human resources department.
Frank Caterina '20, a finance and accounting major, appreciated the opportunity to meet so many AB employees in person. âEvents like this give you the opportunity to present yourself in a real-life setting,â he says. âNetworking is crucial in creating relationships, and I believe that starting early creates a chance for continued opportunity to impress.â
De Ruiterâs story of his first years out of college demonstrates the value of the Muhlenberg network: He got his first job at R. Seelaus & Co., a firm in Summit, N.J., after he reached out to an alumnus who worked there, and he got a foot in the door at AB thanks to Peebles and Rus.
âMuhlenberg is a small College, so you might think the network is pretty small, but everyone in it loves talking to students,â de Ruiter says.
Peebles, who clearly loves talking to students himself, adds: âItâs really hard to run into somebody here or at Muhlenberg who is not a nice person. That is the special sauce of these places.â

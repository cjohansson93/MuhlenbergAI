 Womens lacrosse

softball hits it off with new coach


The debut of Marisa DeStasio as Muhlenbergs new head softball coach was a big hit. Lots of them, in fact.

The Mules pounded out 10 extra-base hits, including two home runs by freshmen, in taking their first two games of the 2011 season, 14-2 against Finlandia and 10-7 against DeSales.

Its the first time since 1997 that Muhlenberg opened the season by scoring double digits in runs in its first two games. Last year, the Mules 




Blohm had a double in each game.




did not score more than nine runs in a game the whole season.

The team hit up and down the lineup. Of the nine players who started both games, eight drove in at least two runs, and all nine scored runs. The veterans hit  senior Jess Kasza went 3-for-6 in the two games, and senior Alyssa Epstein doubled twice in one inning  and the rookies hit. Erica Wenzel hit a two-run homer in her second career at-bat, Kelly Kline belted a two-run homer in the second game, Colleen ODonnell reached base in five of six official plate appearances.

In the opening game, the Mules scored four runs in the second, capped by Wenzels homer, then broke the game open with 10 runs in the fourth  their biggest inning since plating 10 in the second against Franklin & Marshall in 2006.

Muhlenberg sent 16 batters to the plate in the inning, with Esptein and

The Muhlenberg baseball team totaled only seven hits and lost two games to Bridgewater State, 5-3 and 5-0, in Vero Beach, Fla.

Junior Jesse Nusbaum hit a two-run double in the fifth inning of the opening game to cut a 5-1 deficit to 5-3. The Mules (2-4-1) loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh but could not get the tying runs home.

sophomore Devon Barber each collecting two hits. 

That was more than enough for senior Ashley Brewer, who flirted with her second 
straight Opening Day no-hitter. Brewer retired the first 10 batters to face her and wound up with a two-hitter.

In the second game, the Mules rallied from a 6-1 deficit. Brewers two-run double, an RBI double by Kasza and a run-scoring single by junior Brittany Blohm keyed a six-run fourth that gave the Mules a 7-6 lead. Klines round-tripper the following inning made it 9-6.

Senior Alyssa Bruckner settled down after giving up six runs in the second, allowing only one run (on a solo homer) and two hits from the third through the sixth. After she gave up a leadoff single in the seventh, sophomore Angie Sisco came on to get the last three outs and earn the save.

Muhlenberg, which set a school record with 72 stolen bases last year, swiped eight in the two games. Barber led the way with four steals.

Pulice had seven digs to go along with her 17 assists.




The Muhlenberg volleyball and field hockey teams both tuned up for big home weekend contests against Washington by defeating Bryn Mawr. Volleyball won 3-0 at home,
while field hockey enjoyed its biggest offensive game of the season in a 6-0 shutout.

Volleyball needed five tense sets to outlast Dickinson its last time out. Back on their home court, the Mules made things much easier on 
themselves.

Muhlenberg cruised in the first set, staved off a set point in the second and brushed off a slow start in the third. 
The Mules (9-5, 3-1) held the Owls to a .087 hitting percentage in winning their third consecutive match.

Freshman Allison Glass led the way with 12 kills for the Mules, while sophomore 
Katherine Boll added nine kills in just 15 attempts to go along with three blocks. 
Setters Nikki Dickson and Vanessa Pulice combined for 35 assists for Muhlenberg.

After the Mules took the first set, 25-15, the Owls looked poised to knot the match when they survived two Muhlenberg set points and gained 
one of their own at 27-26. But sophomore Joanne Josephson put the Mules on her back, rising up for a kill that evened the 
score and following with an ace that gave Muhlenberg a set point. The Mules then forced Bryn Mawr into an error to close out their longest set of 
the year, 29-27.




Gill's three points were just one fewer than her career total entering the game.




Undeterred, the pesky Owls (10-6, 1-3)  won the first four points of the final set and took a 6-2 lead. Muhlenberg stormed back with 
seven of the next eight, taking a 9-7 lead on an ace by Josephson, and cruised to the finish line, holding off a late charge for a 25-20 victory.
 
It was the eighth sweep of the season for the Mules, who have won five of their last six matches and are 3-1 in the Centennial Conference 
for the first time since 2002.

Junior Lindsey Gambocurta joined sophomores Josephson and Sarah Weyhmuller with six kills apiece, and Josephson had three of Muhlenberg’s nine aces.

After four consecutive losses, field hockey team desperately needed a positive result in the final leg of a five-game road swing. 
Against Bryn Mawr, the Mules got it and then some.

Junior Kayleigh Thies scored two goals and classmate Sierra Lenker made seven saves to pick up her first 
shutout. Fellow junior Meghan Gill added a goal and an assist for the Mules (3-6, 2-2), who jumped on top of the Owls early and 
never looked back in evening their Centennial Conference record.

Thies started the party in the sixth minute, putting the Mules ahead on a feed by junior Christine Germaske. 
After that, the floodgates opened.

Thies scored again in the 15th minute, setting off a flurry in which Muhlenberg increased its lead from 1-0 to 4-0 in less than four minutes. 
Gill finished a pass from freshman Emily Boyle to make it 3-0 in the 17th minute, 
and then assisted on a tally by junior Lauren Jordan just over a minute later as the Mules took a 
sizeable advantage into the half. Boyle’s assist was the first point of her career. 

Freshman Rachel Strow added her first career goal in the second half. It was assisted by Thies, who became only
the second player in team history with at least 15 career goals and assists. Senior Dayna Hovern capped the
scoring with her 14th career goal, giving Muhlenberg a half-dozen for the first time since 2010.

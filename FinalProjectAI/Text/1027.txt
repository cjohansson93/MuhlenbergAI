Our Resident Advisors are vital student leaders within our community. This 20-hour a week position is key in connecting our students with resources, creating friendships, and educating students on justice, equity, diversity and inclusion. Below is a run-down of the kind of work, activities and problem-solving that an RA could deal with during a typical week. 
Planning, creating and implementing Residential Curriculum Initiatives:

Intentional conversations
Community gatherings
Events
Passive resources

Community Engagement and Support: 

Floor events 
Creating study spaces and connecting students with academic resources 
One-on-one relationship building 
Active and intentional conversations with residents 

Crisis Management

On-call support 
Educating others on student code of conduct
Connecting residents to campus resources 
Providing mediations for roommates and others

Administrative Functions 

Submitting duty reports
Working with professional staff to submit incident reports 
One-on-ones with supervisors 
Helping residents with work order and other supportive documentation

This list is not comprehensive, since an RAâs duties and responsibilities depend largely on the needs of their specific community.

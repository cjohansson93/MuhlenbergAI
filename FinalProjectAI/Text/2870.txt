women’s basketball back in top 10





Brenna Ferster and her fellow seniors have received votes in the national poll in all four of their years at Muhlenberg.


Although the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team hasn’t taken the court for a game in more than three weeks, it has been active in the polls.

The Mules (7-1) moved up two spots to No. 11 in the D3hoops.com national poll released last week, and moved up another place to No. 10 in the new poll. Muhlenberg
was ranked 10th in the preseason poll but dropped down to No. 16 after falling to Scranton in the Scotty Wood Tournament championship game.

This is only the second time in the top 10 in the D3hoops.com poll during the regular season for Muhlenberg. In 2001-02, the Mules spent two weeks in the top 10,
with a high rank of No. 8.

Muhlenberg returns to action on Saturday with a home game against Johns Hopkins. Next Thursday, the Mules travel to Gettysburg for what is shaping up as a showdown
for the lead in the Centennial Conference. Both teams are 5-0 in the CC; every other team has at least two league losses. The Bullets are 10-0 and just missed the
top 25 in the national poll, receiving 47 votes.

The Mules are ranked 16th in the coaches poll.

Softball Moves Up in Rankings Before Dropping Twinbill

The Muhlenberg softball team dropped a non-conference doubleheader at Misericordia, falling 3-0 in the opener before losing a wild 12-11 slugfest in the nightcap.

Earlier in the day, the Mules (23-9) moved up to No. 4 in the East in the second NCAA regional rankings of the season. They were No. 7 last week.

Muhlenberg was shut out for just the second time this season in the opener. The Mules had seven hits, including two apiece from senior Colleen O’Donnell and sophomore Brittany Dzieciolowski, but did not get a runner past second base.

The offensive drought was ended on the first batter of the second game, when junior Alyssa Schell led off with a home run to ignite a five-run outburst. Sophomore Alexis Giovinazzo capped the rally with a two-out, two-run single.

Schell (right) led off the second inning with a homer too, becoming the sixth different player in program history to hit two home runs in a game. Muhlenberg added two more runs in the inning, extending its lead to 8-0.

The Cougars (19-13) chipped away, however, closing to within 10-7 after six innings. With two outs in the top of the seventh, senior Kelly Kline belted her eight home run of the season to make it 11-7.

Misericordia won the game with five runs in the bottom of the seventh, ending the game with a walkoff walk. 

Sophomore Taylor Trifiolis went 3-for- 5, including a double, in the nightcap. Kline walked three times in the two games to tie the school record of 25 walks in a season.

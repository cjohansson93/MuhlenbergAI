Endowed gifts provide a permanent source of financial support for an area of the College that is personally important to you. Your gift establishes a fund, which carries your name, and is invested with its annual income directed to your designated program or initiative. It allows you to leave an indelible mark on the lives of students who attend Muhlenberg and enhances the financial strength of the institution by providing lasting benefits.
Endowed gifts may fund:

Scholarships, which allow the over 90 percent of Muhlenberg's deserving students with financial need to attend college


Summer research, which prepares students for graduate school or lives of learning with faculty/student collaborations, research skills, and presentation of scientific findings at professional conferences


Professorships, which help to attract and retain the very best faculty with honorary positions that are highly coveted by top educators, and help to elevate the status of a professor and the institution

For more information, contact Mike Gardner, principal gift officer, at mikegardner@muhlenberg.edu.

baseball drops high-scoring affair 


It was one of those games were the last team to hit was probably going to win it, and that was the case as the Ursinus baseball team outslugged Muhlenberg, 14-13, in a wild game that featured 27 runs, 42 hits, nine doubles, four home runs, 29 runners left on base and eight pitchers.

The Bears (11-12, 2-8), who scored in every inning, plated the winning run on a suicide

squeeze bunt down the third-base line with the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the ninth.

The Mules (11-12, 5-4) took an early lead

The Muhlenberg women’s golf team hosted four other Centennial Conference teams at Lehigh Country Club. The Mules were left with three players when one of their original four had to withdraw, and therefore did not have a team score.

McDaniel won the event with a 376, 12 strokes ahead of Gettysburg.

Junior Amy Venuto led Muhlenberg with a 106. Above, senior Sarah Mellick, who shot a 116, tees off at the picturesque eighth hole.

The men’s tennis team dropped a Centennial Conference match at Dickinson, 8-1. Sophomore Andrew Brod picked up the Mules' lone point at No. 6 singles. Click here for box score.



when freshman John Muha belted his first career home run, a two-out grand slam in the bottom of the first. Ursinus came back to tie the game at five by the end of the third and went ahead 7-5 with single runs in the fourth and fifth.

Then it was Muhlenberg's turn to come back. Sophomore Jesse Nusbaum walloped his first career home run, 



a three-run shot, to highlight a five-run sixth that put the Mules up, 10-7.

That lead lasted until Ursinus scored three times in the bottom of the seventh to take an 11-10 lead. Muhlenberg tied the score in the top of the eighth, but a two-run homer in the bottom of the frame gave the Bears a 13-11 lead headed into the ninth.

The Mules got a break to start the ninth when the leadoff batter reached on a dropped third strike. With one out, Nusbaum singled in a run, and junior Bobby Spindler knocked in the tying run two batters later.

A single and two walks loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning and set the stage for the walkoff bunt.

Nusbaum finished with four RBI and was one of five Mules to record at least three hits. Senior Dan Fisher went 4-for-6 including his 10th double of the season. Fisher, who set a school record with 14 two-baggers last year, is only the second player in team history to reach double figures in doubles in back-to-back seasons.

Senior Eric Pomroy went 3-for-6 and scored three runs, pushing his career total to 102.  He is the seventh Mule to touch home plate 100 times in a career. Junior Joseph DiCecilia had three singles to extend his hitting streak to 15 games.

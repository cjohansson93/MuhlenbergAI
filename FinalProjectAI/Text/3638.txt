cross country teams get down and dirty





Sophomore Erica Bash finished in 24:56; at last year's Paul Short Run her time was 26:09.




The official results show that the Muhlenberg mens cross country team competed in the Brown race and the women in the White race at Lehighs annual Paul Short Run. By the end of their run, though, the women were brown too.

A storm that brought nearly eight inches of rain to the Lehigh Valley turned the Goodman Campus course into a muddy, goopy, wet mess, but it didnt rain on the Mules parade, as both teams had an outstanding day.

Were all covered in mud from head to toe, said junior Melissa Ugelow. In past seasons weve run in sleet and rain; this was just another one of the elements.

Thats what makes cross country cross country.

The men finished 16th out of 40 teams, two-thirds of which were Division I or Division II. Only three Division III squads placed higher than Muhlenberg: Ithaca, New Jersey and Lynchburg, all of which are ranked in other regions. The Mules are ranked ninth in the Mideast Region.

Senior Bobby Torphy came in 16th in the field of 357 runners and was the fourth Division III runner across the line. Bobby McGetrick was the third Division III freshman to finish, coming in 95th overall.

The women were eighth out of 36 teams, finishing behind two Centennial Conference teams and ahead of two others. For the second meet in a row, a freshman was the top Muhlenberg finisher, as Nicole Cronin came in 26th out of 280 entrants, five places ahead of sophomore Samantha Mayden.

It was fun [running through mud and puddles], and we all had a good time, said Ugelow. There were so many people around us it was easy to keep running hard and stay competitive.

The race offered the women a good gauge of their progress, as they ran the same course in their first meet of the season, the Lehigh Valley Championships. Despite the conditions, the Mules saw considerable improvements in their times.

That first race a lot of us were coming off injuries, explained Ugelow. This one was to show off what we have, and I think we did a good job of that.

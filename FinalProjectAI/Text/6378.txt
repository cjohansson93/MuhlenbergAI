The Muhlenberg baseball team won two of its first three games on its Spring Break trip to Fort Myers, Fla., sandwiching two one-run wins against Wheaton (Ill.) and 
Ohio Northern around a loss to Widener. The Mules are 5-1 for the first time since 1978.

In the first game, Muhlenberg spotted Wheaton a 4-0 lead before scoring in each 
of five straight innings to go ahead 10-6. Junior Ryan Rechten pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to save the 10-9 win.

The Mules used long ball to tie the game, with senior Brian Beck belting a solo home run in the second and junior Joseph Vila adding a three-run blast in the third.

Junior John Muha singled in the go-ahead run in the fourth and hit an RBI double 
to cap a four-run fifth. Senior Nick Busillo doubled in what proved to be the winning run in the sixth.




Vila has 14 RBI in six games.




Vila and Muha each went 3-for-5 to lead Muhlenberg to double digits in runs for the fourth straight game. Junior Rob Shannon struck out seven in six innings to earn his second win.

Widener lit up the scoreboard early in Saturday’s second game, plating 15 runs in the first two innings and going on to win, 21-6. Sophomore John Scuderi drove in two runs for the Mules.

On Sunday, Muhlenberg came from behind in the late innings to beat Ohio Northern, 4-3. With the Mules trailing 3-2, Scuderi led off the eighth with a single and went to second on an error. After a single by Vila loaded the bases, Busillo brought in the tying run with a groundout, and freshman Chris Manfredonia singled in the go-ahead run.

Manfredonia also turned a game-ending double play in the bottom of the ninth, giving Rechten his second save in as many days.

Freshman Austin Cush pitched two scoreless innings in relief to earn his first career win. Vila went 2-for-3 to raise his batting average to .522.

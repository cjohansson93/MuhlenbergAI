Men's tennis season preview 


The Muhlenberg men's tennis team heads into the spring season with plenty of depth and experience.


	 Friday, March 14, 2014  08:52 AM

The deep freeze that has enveloped the region this winter hasn’t given the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team many options for practice locations. When the Mules open the season Lafayette tomorrow night, they’ll have no shortage of options to fill the lineup. 
 “We are pretty deep top to bottom” senior Ben Berkowitz said. “A lot of teams have a great top two players but then a huge drop-off after that. That isn’t the case with us. Everyone can compete with everyone.”
Berkowitz and company are hoping that internal competition, and the experience gained by a young Mules squad a year ago, is evident when they take the court against someone other than themselves. Ten of the 13 non-freshmen on the team saw action in at least one league match a year ago, and seven have at least 20 matches to their name.
Berkowitz and fellow senior and second-year captain Jason Teitelbaum  have plenty of experience to share with their younger counterparts. Teitelbaum, who steps into the No. 2 singles spot, is the Mules’ active leader with 42 victories, split evenly between doubles and singles. Berkowitz, who will play No. 3, is the leader with 24 career singles victories.

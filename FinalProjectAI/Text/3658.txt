NCAA Preview

torphy looks to start quick,finish strong at xc nationals


Bobby Torphy's 2010 cross country season 
began a little later than that of his Muhlenberg teammates, so it's only fitting that it's ending later too.

Torphy is the lone Mule competing in the NCAA Championships at Wartburg University in Waverly, Iowa, on Saturday. He qualified by finishing 20th at the NCAA Mideast Regional last weekend.

Just before the start of the first meet of the season, the Lehigh Invitational, Torphy 



went to give a teammate a high five and in return got his toe stepped on.

"I was off in the back looking down at my feet, trying to figure out how to make the pain go away, and the next thing I know the race is starting," he recalled. "I had to scamper back to the line."

Torphy made up for the late start, finishing 



seventh to lead all Division III runners at the meet, and the poise he showed in recovering has carried him through a fantastic senior season. He's been Muhlenberg's top runner in all of his races this season en route to his second consecutive invitation to the NCAA Championships.

Not bad for someone who didn't even run cross country in high school. Torphy ran track and played basketball for the four years prior to coming to Muhlenberg. He says he initially joined the Mule cross country team only to get in better shape for track and never thought of himself as a cross country runner, but continued to surprise himself.

 "I took it slow from the start," he said. "I didn't run the miles freshman year that I run now, gradually working my way into being a cross country runner. I've been able to see improvement every year, and when you're constantly improving it gives you more motivation to keep doing all the little things that lead to success."

Torphy hopes to improve on his first trip to nationals last year, when he finished 169th out of 276 runners. What did he learn from that experience?

"The main thing I took back was you have to get out quick the first mile," Torphy said. "Last year I got stuck behind some people. With so many people running around the same time it's easy to get stuck behind a pack of runners, and it's tough to move up as the race goes on. I normally go out quick, but maybe I'll be a little quicker. I just want to put myself in a good position."

The course should help put Torphy in a good position. After three consecutive meets - the DeSales Invitational, Centennial Conference Championships and Mideast Regional - on hilly courses, the NCAA Championship course is reported to be flat and fast, which is more to Torphy's liking.

"I'm looking forward to see what it's like there," said Torphy. "I'm looking to do really well."

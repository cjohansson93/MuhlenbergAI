The View from The View



While in high school on Long Island, Brian Teta â98 read The Late Shift by Bill Carter, which documented the war between Jay Leno and David Letterman for late-night television dominance. Upon finishing the book, Teta knew he wanted to work for Lettermanâhis sincerity and sarcasm set him apart.

So when Teta was offered a position as the stupid-pet-trick booker for the Late Show with David Letterman nearly a decade later, âit was a no-brainer,â he says. âIt lived up to my expectations. It was like playing shortstop for the Yankees.â
Teta, who graduated with a degree in communications, worked for a few years on a number of daytime shows, including those of Montel Williams, Ricki Lake and Judge Hatchett. Letterman, though, was Tetaâs big break. In 11 years with the show, he served in a number of roles, most notably as the sports booker. He was responsible for securing the appearance of the Super-Bowl-winning quarterback on the following nightâs show. That involved running through the mass of humanity on the field after the game to get to the most-wanted person, a role that Teta excelled inâhe managed it every year except his last, when he brought in New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick instead of Tom Brady.
When Letterman retired in 2015, Teta took a job as an executive producer of The View, where he remains. Itâs the culmination of a career that started at The Muhlenberg Weekly and included four years of internships in television during his time at school. With The View, heâs on the floor during tapings and at the helm of what one The New York Times Magazine feature recently dubbed âthe most important political TV show in America.â âThe road to the White House,â says Teta, ânow goes through The View.â

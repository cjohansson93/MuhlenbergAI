Rice clocked a time of 49.17 and finished seventh in his heat. The top two in each heat, plus the two next best times, qualified for the final. The last qualifier had a time of 48.27.

The race ended a phenomenal junior year in which Rice was named Most Outstanding Performer at the Centennial Conference Championships both indoors and outdoors and
qualified for the NCAA Championships both seasons.

The race also ended the 2010-11 Muhlenberg year in athletics. Look for the year in review next week on Mule Sports Daily.

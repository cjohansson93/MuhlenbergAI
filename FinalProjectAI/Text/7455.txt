Baseball Loses on Late Run


The Muhlenberg baseball team lost at Swarthmore, 4-3, in its third one-run game in a week.

All but two of the game’s runs were scored in the first inning. The Mules (13-13, 6-4) needed only three batters to take a 1-0 lead, as freshman
John Icaza led off with a double and came around on two wild pitches. Later in the inning, senior Max Litvak
doubled and scored on a single by senior Nick Kennedy.

The Garnet (15-13, 4-7) responded with three in the bottom of the inning, and the score remained 3-2 until the top of the fifth, when
junior Conor McDermott led off with his second single of the game and came home on a two-out double by junior
Jimmy Cody.

Muhlenberg did not get another hit for the rest of the game, however, and Swarthmore plated the winning run in the bottom of the eighth.

The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team had plenty of answers for Swarthmore in a Centennial Conference thriller, but the Garnet had the last word. 



The Mules erased a five-goal deficit in the final 12 minutes of regulation, then came back from a goal down in overtime to force a sudden-victory extra session. But Swarthmore won the opening draw and scored 19 seconds into the second overtime to clinch an 11-10 victory and end Muhlenberg’s hopes for a stirring comeback win at home. The loss was the third straight for the Mules (7-6, 1-5), who have three games remaining. It was just the third double-overtime game in program history.

Junior Stephanie Umbach was one of three Mules to equal or surpass school records on the night, and two of them did so to their own marks. Umbach netted seven goals, six of them after halftime, for her 13th hat trick of the season, eclipsing the program record she tied last year. 

Senior Kaitlyn McCaffrey had four caused turnovers, tying her own single-season mark of 39 established as a freshman, and classmate Michelle Certosimo matched the single-season record of 50 assists with a pair of helpers, becoming the ninth player in CC history to reach that plateau.

Despite playing its worst first half of the season, Muhlenberg somehow nearly had a victory to pair with those milestones. Held to just two goals on eight shots at intermission, the Mules watched the Garnet (7-6, 2-4) open the second-half scoring and go ahead, 8-2, with 20:29 to play. Then Muhlenberg came alive.

Umbach (left) scored the next two goals to ignite a closing stretch in which the Mules scored seven of the final eight in regulation. After Swarthmore made it 9-4 with 12:30 to play, Umbach found the back of the net twice more, then did it again after a tally by junior Kayleigh Thies to cut the deficit to one with 3:07 left.

The Garnet won the ensuing draw and attempted to run out the clock, but turned it over with 33 ticks remaining. Freshman Allison Murnick scooped up the loose ball and, after a successful clear, Thies tied it on a thrilling goal with 23.9 seconds showing on the clock.  

The Mules found themselves down once again just 22 seconds into overtime, but pulled even again on Umbach’s 70th goal of the season, a quick strike off a dish from Certosimo with 49.6 ticks remaining. Swarthmore had a chance to win in the final seconds, earning a free-position shot with 1.6 seconds left, but freshman netminder Sara Allison, who came in after halftime, made a brilliant save on the potential game-winner to force double overtime. Unfortunately for the Mules, that only delayed the disappointing final result.

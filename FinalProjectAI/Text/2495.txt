The Muhlenberg men’s golf team picked up its second first-place trophy of the fall, outshooting local rivals Moravian and DeSales to win the John Makuvek Cup, an annual tournament named for the longtime Moravian coach. 
The Mules, who opened the season by winning a tournament hosted by Moravian, were six strokes better than the Greyhounds to earn a point in the Matte Award competition. Muhlenberg leads the all-sports race, 3-0 (also winning in men’s soccer and volleyball); the next Matte contest is scheduled for October 28 in women’s soccer. 
Sophomore John Froberg shot a career-low 72, two strokes off the lead. Five over par after the first five holes, Froberg rebounded to go minus-3 the rest of the way, recording five birdies on the final 11 holes.
Sophomore David Barkley (80), freshman Evan Overcash (81) and juniors Greg Hewitt (82) and Jonathan Graulich (83) rounded out the top five. Hewitt shot a birdie on the 498-yard, par-5 11th hole.

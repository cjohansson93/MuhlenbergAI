Merritt Jacob â Physics Laboratory Manager / Instructor 107 Trumbower Science Building (484)664-3643 Fax: (484)664-3546

Background M. S. - Physics / University of Pittsburgh B. S. - Physics / University of Pittsburgh
I came to Muhlenberg College in 1996, bringing with me ten years of industrial research and development experience. My work included development of commercial blasting products, basic research in pyrotechnics that took me on a three year stint to Ayrshire, Scotland, and airbag initiation systems design for the automotive industry. I have been granted several patents covering commercial blasting systems and electronic delay detonators and initiators.
My role at the college includes, among other things, managing the physics laboratories and equipment, setting up physics labs and lecture demonstrations, acting as the physics department safety representative, creating and maintaining the physics department web site as well instructing a general physics laboratory section each semester.
Personal interests include cooking, woodworking, movies  and any new electronic gadgetry. I currently live on a small farm north of the college with my wife Jeanine.

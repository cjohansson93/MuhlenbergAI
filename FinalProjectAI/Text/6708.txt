Hargrove Flirts with Triple-Double as Men's Basketball Downs Hounds
 Sunday, December 16, 2012







					 

 Women’s basketball


This time, almost counted more for junior Kevin Hargrove.

For the second time in his career, Hargrove fell just short of a triple-double as he led the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team to a 71-52 win over crosstown rival Moravian.




O'Hara, who added six rebounds and four points, has three career double-digit assist games.



He finished with 13 rebounds, nine points and nine blocks, needing just two more additions to his stat line to hit the triple-double mark.

“This is the second time I’ve just missed a triple-double,” said Hargrove. “I had [a school-record] 10 blocks [and 13 rebounds against DeSales] my freshman year and was just two points away from a triple-double that time.

“I probably lead the nation in ‘close’ triple-doubles,” he laughed.

Although he didn’t get the triple-double, he got something more meaningful that he didn’t get in the DeSales game: a win. His effort was enough to propel the Mules (6-3) to their fifth win in six games, and it came against a hot Greyhound team that was off to its best start in 10 years. 

Muhlenberg entered the contest coming off a break for finals and a tough loss at Johns Hopkins the previous Saturday.

“When we came back from the break, everyone’s minds refocused on Hopkins and how we lost that game,” stated Hargrove. “We watched the film and we knew that we came up short on defensive rebounding, so we came in with that as our main goal today.”

Hargrove grabbed 11 defensive boards himself, and his shot-blocking ability in the paint helped Muhlenberg limit the Greyhounds (6-2) to 30.6-percent shooting.




Killing has scored at least 20 points in five of his last six games.




Sophomore Malique Killing turned in another strong performance for Muhlenberg, scoring a game-high 23 points on 10-for-16 shooting from the field. The Mules never trailed after Killing hit a three to give them a 3-0 lead at the 18:20 mark in the first half.

Muhlenberg led by 16 midway through the second half before Moravian (6-2) went on a 10-0 run to cut the gap to six. But the Mules responded with a 13-2 run that included three baskets by Hargrove to open up a commanding 62-45 lead with 4:21 left.

Junior Austin Curry scored 14 points, 12 of them coming on three-pointers.

Overall, Muhlenberg shot 45.0 percent from the field, including a 42.1 percent effort from behind the arc.

Freshman Alec Stavetski finished with 13 points, eight of them from the charity stripe, and for the second time this season, senior Matt O’Hara dished out 10 assists.

The win left Muhlenberg with a 5½-4½ lead in the 2012-13 Matte Award standings. The next scheduled Matte contest isn’t until a baseball game on March 12.

The Mules leave bright and early for Puerto Rico tomorrow, where they will play two games to cap off a stretch of three games in four days.

“Besides the game this afternoon, the only thing we’ve been talking about is going down to Puerto Rico, playing well there and having fun,” added Hargrove. “Playing a lot of games in a short span is nothing new to us – we played three road games in a row, all within a week, so we’re able to handle it.”

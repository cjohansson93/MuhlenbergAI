 Softball honors

Druker, Sutker earn all-conference honors;Andrews named coach of the year



After a successful run to the semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs, the Muhlenberg womens tennis team had two singles players and a doubles team receive all-conference recognition.

Senior Caitie Druker was named a first-team singles player, while classmate Sara Sutker was named to the second team.

The two were also honored as a second-team All-CC doubles team for the second year in a row. Its the third time in the past four years that Muhlenberg has had at least one player and doubles team receive all-conference recognition in the same season.


Druker (right), who was named a second-team singles player last season, finished the spring 7-5 at No. 1 singles, including a 5-3 mark in CC matches. She finished her Mule career in ninth-place on the schools all-time spring singles wins list (33) and combined spring wins list (68).

Sutker (left) went 10-5 in singles action during the spring  8-4 at No. 2 and 2-1 at No. 1  with a 7-3 record in CC play. She closed out her Muhlenberg career ranked fourth in spring singles wins (40) and fifth in combined spring wins (75).

The duo combined to finish the spring 7-7 at No. 1 doubles, with a 5-4 mark in CC play. Their 35 spring doubles wins are the second-most in Mule history.

Coach Linda Andrews was named the CC coach of the year after leading the Mules back to the conference playoffs. Its the first time she has won the award, which has only been presented the past three seasons.

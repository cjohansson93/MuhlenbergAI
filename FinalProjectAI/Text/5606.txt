Softball Foiled by TCNJ Again


The Muhlenberg softball team still has never beaten The College of New Jersey, but it is coming oh-so-close.

The Mules took the Lions to extra innings in the first game of a home doubleheader before losing, 2-1. TCNJ completed the sweep with a 12-1 win in the second game.

Muhlenberg is now 0-30 all-time against TCNJ in a series that dates back to 1990. Last year, the Mules were five outs away from a win, but the Lions rallied to keep the streak alive.

The extra-inning loss spoiled another stellar outing by junior Lara Kestenbaum, who allowed four singles and no earned runs in eight innings. The winning run scored in the top of the eighth on an infield error. 

Muhlenberg (3-11) got the potential tying run to third with one out in its half of the eighth, but the last two outs were recorded without the run scoring.

Junior RiRi Ferrigno drove in the Mules’ run with a first-inning single.

The nightcap was a different story, as TCNJ broke the game open by scoring nine runs in the third after having two out and nobody on.

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team broke into the Centennial Conference win column with a 9-0 shutout of Ursinus. 

All six Mule players won at both doubles and singles, including sophomore Jonathan Farber (above), who prevailed in his first career No. 1 doubles match and
won in straight sets at No. 4 singles.

It was the fourth straight win for the Mules (3-2, 1-2) against the Bears, the second straight by shutout.

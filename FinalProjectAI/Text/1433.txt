#17, 36, 62, 63 Department Chair and Hiring Manager Training, Job Descriptions, HR Hiring and Retention Tracking Software
*Review and revise search procedures to ensure more robust and diverse candidate pools and require all chairs and hiring managers  to undergo training about best practices in hiring diverse candidates.
*All divisions will include in every employee job description the expectation that employees will actively foster inclusion, justice, and social equity in their work. In addition, employees will be asked to assess and evaluate their personal efforts in these areas.
*HR would buy and implement hiring and retention software, so that the College would have a thorough historical record of jobs, candidates, hiring and continuing employment for all employees.
We believe that these initiatives are strengthened in combination with each other. If implemented, they will provide the College with a âfront doorâ for all future hiring decisions and institutional history on diversity hiring and retention. The Collegeâs next diversity strategic planning committee would have this data available to them so as to be better able to judge the strengths and shortcomings of current initiatives.







#39 Meeting Points Series
The Multicultural Center offers a course development grant opportunity, inviting faculty to link their courses to a lecture series connected to the Centerâs mission. The goals of the Meeting Points Series are to (1) identify a cohort of faculty and staff who would be willing to connect their courses to the mission of the Multicultural Center, (2) provide formal and informal opportunities for faculty development around diversity pedagogy, (3) bring together Muhlenberg community members to critically address issues of social identity, discrimination, and prejudice, and (4) contribute to the HDGE Learning Goals for General Education adopted by the faculty.
The Meeting Points Series has become an important ongoing venue for faculty to talk about diversity issues on campus, in the curriculum and in their teaching. It needs to have a stronger and more predictable funding base.  This ongoing series will serve to help retain diverse faculty who will have a low-risk venue for being in conversation with colleagues about important diversity issues. 







#41 Assistant Director of Multicultural Life/Coordinator for Diversity and Inclusion in Athletics Joint Position 
Allocate resources to maintain a current position, Assistant Director of Multicultural Life/Coordinator for Diversity and Inclusion in Athletics, that has been funded with grant and other soft funds for the past three years.  The position supports campus-wide programmatic initiatives to cultivate a community of inclusivity, pursuing specific goals and objectives as agreed upon with the Directors of Multicultural Life and Athletics.
An effective position that links athletics and Multicultural Life, an especially important connection given the increasing diversity of the Collegeâs Student-Athletes. 







#60 Cohort Hiring and Early Retirement Incentives Plans
Identify opportunities for cohort hiring and provide necessary funding for cohort and opportunity hires. Because of the expense of this program, cohort hiring would have to be introduced along with a new Early Retirement Incentive Plan. The recommendation is that both of these ideas be studied in conjunction with each other, so that the size, expense and timing of cohort hiring is aligned with the early retirement plan.
A challenge in retaining a diverse faculty is that those faculty are called on to do an overwhelming amount of diversity work on campus. Hiring a cohort of faculty and staff will accelerate the diversification of faculty and staff and create a sustainable work culture for those faculty and staff in order to avoid overload and burnout. The early retirement incentive plan provides the open positions for the cohort hiring on a timed and affordable schedule. 







#61 Consortium for Faculty Diversity Program
Utilize the Center for Faculty Diversity program more intentionally and effectively, and provide funding resources for the CFD program.
The CFD has proven itself to be a strong organization of identifying outstanding postdoctoral candidates for teaching positions at Muhlenberg. Moreover, it is a Consortium that is committed to ongoing understanding and conveying best practices for diversity hiring and retention. 







#64 Mentoring/Ambassador Programming
Develop mentoring/ambassador programming that specifically addresses the unique needs of faculty, staff, and administrators of color (e.g., burn-out, isolation, etc.).  This program should also regularly solicit feedback from faculty, staff, and administrators of color about their experiences on campus.
This is yellow due to concern that this issue of burn-out and isolation is not well understood. We are open to continuing conversation and perhaps the formation of a committee to study these important questions, prior to the creation of a program. 







#16 Faculty Diversity and Safe Space Training
This initiative is to propose that all faculty and staff on Muhlenbergâs campus (including but not limited to professors, dinning staff, and campus police) should be required to complete diversity and safe space training. This training should include how to work with LGBTQIA students in and out of the classroom and how to accommodate trans* and gender variant students.  
Higher education research does not suggest that one-time, mandatory diversity training of faculty and staff is an effective strategy for improving the diversity culture and climate on campus. However, it may be that there are liberal arts campuses that have effectively created training programs that are attractive and reassuring to candidates, and serve to âentice potential faculty and staff.â We are open to learning more information about such programs, and their possible connections to programming of the Faculty Center for Teaching and the Consortium for Faculty Diversity.







#24, #25 Gender Neutral Bathrooms
The initiative would involve implementing the additional option of gender neutral bathrooms at least in the academic buildings of Muhlenbergâs campus but ideally in all buildings and dorms. This would allow for our campus to be significantly more trans-inclusive and show queer advocacy to students looking at the college. 
We would like to hear more discussion about this proposal, particularly why it is especially pertinent to hiring and retention. 







#11 Diversify Faculty and Staff Through Trial for Hire
The trial-for-hire is similar to try before you buy concept. It stresses more on the capability and self-desire (oneâs love for a particular job) of potential candidates than the qualifications (degree, years of experience, publications, etc.). Have the candidates teach or perform the particular job requirements for a period of time (one or two classes, one or two months, etc.) Depending on the accreditation, minimum qualifications would still need to be set (degree obtained or equivalent years of experience, background checks, medical examinations for TB/etc.) With the bar being set at a different height, it is possible to attract more candidates of diverse population.
In a leanly staffed college such as Muhlenberg, the ethic is to hire candidates who can âhit the ground running.â The extensive âtrialâ period will require extensive amount of supervisory time and would be frustrating for top candidates.

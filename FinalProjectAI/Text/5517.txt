farris, deluca earn all-america honors




The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team hopes to be playing on the final weekend of the Division III season one of these years, but for now the
Mules have to be content with earning historic honors.

Senior Kyle Farris and junior John DeLuca received All-America honorable mention from the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association during college 

lacrosse’s championship weekend. They are the first two All-Americans in program history.

Earlier this month, the duo became Muhlenberg’s first two first-team All-Centennial
Conference selections.

Farris (right), a three-time All-CC player, led Muhlenberg and ranked sixth in the CC with a school-record 36 goals. He tied for the conference lead man-up goals (13) and recorded five game-winning goals. 
Farris graduated as the program’s all-time leader with 101 goals and 18 hat tricks.

DeLuca (left) was the leader of a defense that posted an 8.15 goals-against average, which ranked fourth in the CC after the Mules finished last in that category in 
2007. He picked up 31 ground balls and scored six goals.

Men’s lacrosse is the fourth program in Muhlenberg College athletic history to produce multiple All-Americans in the same season. The others were football (six times), men’s 
soccer (twice) and men’s indoor track and field (once).

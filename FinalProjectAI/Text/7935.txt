Men's Soccer Ties Drew in Final Non-Conference Tuneup
 Wednesday, September 17, 2014 - page 2







					 




Neither side could find a breakthrough in the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s scoreless draw against Drew.

The result was typical in an ultracompetitive rivalry that has now seen 10 one-goal games and three ties in the last 14 meetings.

The Mules (4-0-1) outshot the Rangers (2-1-4) by an 18-6 margin but were kept off the board for the first time this year.
 
Senior Danny Pinto (right) made two saves while posting his fourth straight game without 
giving up a goal. The Mules’ scoreless streak now stands at 428 minutes, and they have only given up one score all 
season. Through Sunday’s games, Muhlenberg was one of 16 teams in Division III to have played at least four games and allowed fewer than two goals. 

The defense has let up just six shots on goal in the last four games.

Muhlenberg remains undefeated as it heads into Centennial Conference play at home against McDaniel on Saturday.

Muhlenberg College is committed to a culture of self-evaluation, continuous improvement, and accountability. In pursuit of these objectives, the Board of Trustees has created a Board of Observers program that will provide regular occasions for assessment and the review of planning at the departmental level, communicate Muhlenberg's strengths to the broader academic world, and create a broader base of volunteer leadership and philanthropic support for the College by engaging distinguished alumni, parents, and friends in substantive work that will develop them as informed advocates and potential future candidates for the Board of Trustees.

Volleyball Beats Dickinson While Digging for a Cure
 Saturday, October 1, 2011 - page 3

The Muhlenberg volleyball team will gladly take any win in can get, but if they had their choice, normally the Mules would prefer to win in three sets.

Saturday’s match against Dickinson, however, may have been the exception. After claiming the first two sets with relative ease, the Mules dropped the third before finishing off the Red Devils in set four, 25-20.

The reason the Mules did not quite mind going to a fourth set was because it gave them a chance to add to their dig total on “Digging for a Cure” day. The team collected donations and pledges for every dig it recorded against the Red Devils, so the extra set gave the Mules an opportunity to raise more money for Tanner’s Touch, a non-profit organization out of Westminster, Md., that raises awareness and funds to support pediatric cancer research.

The Mules scored the first four points of the match, two on back-to-back blocks by the duo of senior Jackie Price and freshman Holly Hynson, and jumped out to a quick 11-6 lead in the first set. Dickinson pulled to within three, but the Mules scored nine of the final 11 points and finished the set out on an emphatic kill by Hynson for a 25-15 win.

The second set was much tighter in the early stages, and with the Mules holding a 14-13 lead, they called timeout. Whatever was said in the huddle must have worked because Muhlenberg scored 11 of the next 14 points for the win.

Hynson and freshman Lindsey Gambocurta got the Mules started with back-to-back kills. Then classmate Nikki Dickson added a pair of aces before senior Brooke McQueen and sophomore Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare registered kills to close out the 25-16 victory.

With the third set tied at 11, the Red Devils grabbed the momentum and held on for a 25-20 win to force another set.

The fourth started out tight with two teams tied at 10. Muhlenberg created some separation thanks to four kills from Price and a pair of blocks from the duo of Price and Gambocurta to pull in front 23-17.  

Dickinson would not go away and scored three straight points to pull to within three. But Price came through will a kill that stopped the momentum, and Muhlenberg won the game on the next point.

McQueen led the way with 11 kills, while Price and Hynson added nine apiece. Price also finished with five blocks. Freshman Alyssa Schell paced the defense with 16 digs for Tanner’s Touch, and Dickson added 13 digs with 14 assists and three aces.

Muhlenberg dropped its second match of the day, 3-1, to Mount St. Mary. Price registered 11 kills and a season-high six blocks, while sophomore Morgan Duggan added 14 assists, 16 digs and 2 aces against the Knights.

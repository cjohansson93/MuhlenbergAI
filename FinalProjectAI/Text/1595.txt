The inaugural 19th Street Fair is set for April 30. The event, which will be from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., will be a combination of entertainment and sidewalk sales. The merchants of the 19 th Street area and Muhlenberg College have partnered together to present this event, which is made possible by a sponsorship by Lafayette Ambassador Bank.
The event will take place along 19th Street between Tilghman and Liberty Streets and one block east and west on Allen Street.
Starting at 2 p.m., there will be a strolling a capella group, magicians, face-painting, artists, musicians and sidewalk sales along 19 th Street and up and down the adjacent blocks of Allen Street. Programs and performance schedules will be available at several businesses during the event. Lafayette Ambassador Bank, located at 19 th and Allen Streets, will serve as the information headquarters for the event.
The street fair is part of the 19th Street Experience initiative. To date, there has already been a successful Muhlenberg 19 th Street Film Forum, which featured films at the Civic Theatre, followed by commentary and discussion groups led by Muhlenberg College faculty members.
The street fair will also mark the debut of a new passport program, sponsored by the City of Allentown, and produced by the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce. 30,000 passports, which include discounts to area merchants and restaurants, will be distributed as part of the plan.

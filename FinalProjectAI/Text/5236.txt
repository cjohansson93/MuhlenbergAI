brewer earns secondcentennial award


Sophomore Ashley Brewer of the Muhlenberg softball team was honored by the Centennial Conference for the second week in a row.

Last week’s player of the week, Brewer was named pitcher of the week this time after going 2-1 with a 0.95 ERA in four appearances. 
In 22 innings, she struck out 16 and allowed only 13 hits (for a .176 opponents’ batting average). 
Brewer pitched a four-hit shutout against Hunter and tossed a three-hitter to beat Gettysburg in the Mules’ CC opener.

For the season, Brewer is 3-4 with a 0.94 ERA and 51 strikeouts in 52 1/3 innings. Opponents are hitting just .190 against her. Brewer also is the team’s leading
hitter with a .452 batting average.

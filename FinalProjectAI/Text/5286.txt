Needing a win in the last game of the regular season to earn a bye to the Centennial Conference semifinals, the Muhlenberg 



Rosenberg’s three-pointer gave the Mules a 54-44 lead with 15:26 remaining.



men's basketball team made an incredible comeback to force overtime, but wound up losing to Ursinus, 97-90.

So instead of avoiding the first-round playoff game, the Mules (15-10, 11-7) will get the next-best thing: They'll get to play at home one more time, hosting Haverford on Wednesday at a time to be determined.

Muhlenberg led by 10 points in the first five minutes of the second half, but hot three-point shooting allowed the Bears to take a 10-point lead of their own. It was 79-69 with 2:57 on the clock before the Mules closed out regulation on an 11-1 run.

Back-to-back steals near midcourt by sophomore Evan Tozer and junior Zachary Rosenberg led to four straight points, and a three-pointer from the corner by junior Ryan Foster brought Muhlenberg within one, 79-78, with 57.8 seconds left.

After an Ursinus miss, junior Peter Barnes was fouled with 24.4 seconds left but missed both free throws. Poor shooting from the line (54.2 percent) was a problem for the Mules the entire game.

The Bears made one of two free throws with 22.1 seconds left to go up 80-78. Tozer drove in for a layup with 6.8 ticks showing to tie the score at 80, and Ursinus missed an off-balance three-pointer at the buzzer.

A three-point play by Barnes gave Muhlenberg an 83-82 lead early in the overtime. The Bears ran off the next seven points to take the lead for good.

Trailing 93-90 with about a minute left, the Mules had a shot to tie, but Tozer's three-pointer from the wing went in and out.

Barnes finished with 18 points to lead four Muhlenberg players in double figures. Foster had 17 points, Rosenberg added 13, and freshman Spencer Liddic scored 14 points and blocked 5 shots.

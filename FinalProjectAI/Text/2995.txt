MEN’S SOCCER FALLS IN DOUBLE OVERTIME



Seeking its second straight win against a nationally ranked opponent, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team fell just short on Saturday night.

The Mules (6-3, 3-1) lost 2-1 to No. 14 Johns Hopkins in double overtime in heartbreaking

fashion, as an own goal gave the Blue Jays (10-2, 3-1) the victory in the 
104th minute.

After a scoreless first half in which both sides registered six shots, Muhlenberg took over in the second. The Mules outshot Johns Hopkins 13-3 in the second half, 


 Women’s Soccer Also Beaten by Ranked Foe




The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team was also topped by a nationally ranked opponent, as the Mules (5-4, 2-1) fell 4-1 to No. 21 Dickinson (8-2, 2-2).

Muhlenberg took an early lead, scoring just 48 seconds into the game. During a scramble in front of the net, senior Christina O’Grady put in the loose ball 
for her second goal of the season.

The Red Devils fought back for the win, scoring two goals three minutes apart in the first half and adding two more in the second.

finally breaking the tie in the 76th minute, when senior Mike Gehrmann raced down the middle of the field and fired a shot into the bottom left corner past the 

diving Hopkins keeper.

The Mules’ lead didn’t last long, however, as the Blue Jays responded just over two minutes later, when their leading scorer tapped a feed over the 
keeper to tie things back up.

Muhlenberg managed four shots after the tying goal, including a laser by sophomore Cody Antonini that went just over the bar, but could not prevent overtime.
Antonini’s goal-scoring streak was snapped at eight games, tying the school record for the start of a season.

The Mules’ best chance in overtime came in the first period from Gehrmann, who also blasted a shot that was just too high. 

The game concluded a stretch in which Muhlenberg played its first four Centennial Conference games against regionally ranked opponents. The Mules finished 3-1, 
outscoring their opponents 7-2.

Despite the loss, Muhlenberg remains tied for first place in the conference.

Center for Ethics to host lecture on health care public relations practices on Feb. 17


Muhlenberg Collegeâs Center for Ethics will host a lecture by Wendell Potter, a former health care industry public relations professional who is now a vocal critic of the industry and its tactics, on Feb. 17.


	 Friday, February 12, 2016  04:02 PM

The talk will take place in Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum at 6:45 p.m., and is free and open to the public.
Potter spent 20 years in corporate PR, and before retiring was the former head of corporate communications for Cigna. Since leaving this job he has become a vocal critic of the health care industry and its public relations tactics. He is a senior analyst at The Center for Public Integrity.
The event is part of the Center for Ethics’ spring programming, “Influence & Information: Manipulation Nation,” which focuses on topics related to manipulation and manipulative practices.
Upcoming Center for Ethics events include:
Paul Offit lecture, “The Strange Case of Vaccine Exemptions”March 2, Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum, 6:45 p.m.Offit is the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Professor of Vaccinology and Pediatrics at Penn. He has written books on the anti-vaccination movement, autism, alternative medicine and religion and science.
Victor Pickard lecture, “Media Democracy in an Age of Corporate Libertarianism”March 16, Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum, 6:45 p.m.Pickard will examine the ways the commercialized American media system is unique, and how keeping the current power arrangement intact means that the rights of media corporations are privileged over those of everyone else.
Through thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members.
Chris Sistare, professor of philosophy and co-director of philosophy and political thought, serves as director; Tad Robinson, associate professor of philosophy, is this year’s program director.
During the fall 2015 semester, the Center for Ethics presented programming on “Influence & Information: Whose Safety? Whose Security?” The spring theme connects to the fall programming in significant ways.

At Muhlenberg, students may pursue a major and minor in English literatures, as well as a major in English & creative writing and an interdisciplinary minor in creative & professional writing.
The Department of English Literatures & Writing at Muhlenberg offers a flexible curriculum for the study of diverse literatures written in the English language. The department focuses on written, dramatic, filmic and transmedia âtextsâ as well as offering writing classes in fiction, poetry, plays, screenplays, criticism, journalism and other genres. Our offerings include British, American and Postcolonial literatures, African American, Global Black and Native American literatures, Jewish, women and LGBTQ+ writers as well as literatures addressing genocide, human rights and ecology.
Creative and critical writing puts our students in conversation with the voices of the past and present, with a particular attention to voices that have been previously underrepresented. A focus on social justice embraces literatureâs role in creating a fairer and more equitable world by listening to each otherâs stories and voices.
Regular and special topics courses focus on traditional and contemporary issues. Small class sizes create dynamic conversations in the classroom and offer opportunities for learning and community engagement. 
English Literatures & Writing students write clearly and persuasively, read carefully and think inventively. Program graduates move on to jobs as lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, teachers and CEOs and administrators of a wide-range of companies, public and private.

Wrestling: Three Win Places at Citrus Open



The Muhlenberg wrestling team closed out 2017 by traveling to Florida for the Citrus Open and came back with three placewinners.


	 Saturday, December 30, 2017  11:58 AM


Junior Gennaro Cerminara came in second at 197, sophomore Dylan Schwartz placed third at 165, and sophomore Austin Sherman was fifth at 141.
The Mules came in seventh in a field of 11 teams that included two that have been ranked in the top 10 in Division III this season (Augsburg and New York University) as well as Division II schools Upper Iowa and UNC Pembroke.
Cerminara (pictured above) went 3-1 to score the best finish of his career; he previously placed third at three tournaments. Along the way, he reached the career milestones of 50 wins and 30 pins, with his 30th pin coming in a career-best 29 seconds against an opponent from Ursinus in the semifinals. Cerminara was decisioned by an Upper Iowa wrestler, 11-6, in the final.

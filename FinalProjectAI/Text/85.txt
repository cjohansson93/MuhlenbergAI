A Feeling Of, Feeling For
A Feeling Of, Feeling For is a ritualistic exploration of what it means for individuals to feel for one another and for themselves. It requires everyone in the space to confront the imperfect and ruinous parts of our past. This devised performance challenges the audience to move away from intellectualized compassion and towards intimacy and vulnerability with the stories presented on stage.

Dublin City University (DCU) located in Dublin, Republic of Ireland
Muhlenbergâs semester program in Dublin is specially designed for students majoring in Media & Communication and Film Studies but is open to all students meeting program prerequisites. All coursework is offered in the School of Communications at DCU. A member of the Muhlenberg Media & Communication faculty travels with students to Dublin for the semester. While at DCU, students enroll in 4 courses: The Dublin Seminar, a course in an accelerated format taught by the Muhlenberg faculty member; two Media & Communication electives taught by faculty at DCU; and COM 960 - Communication Internship in a communication-related field. An outside agency matches students with their internships during the semester prior to the study abroad experience.

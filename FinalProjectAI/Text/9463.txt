Established in memory of the life and service of Robert C. Williams, academic vice president and dean of the College from 1985 to 1987, The Robert C. Williams Faculty Award honors a junior faculty member for distinguished scholarship and research or public performance.
At Muhlenberg, Orzech has created three major bodies of work entitled "Translated Cities," "Rush Hour" and "Family History." Her work includes prints and drawings that have been showcased locally, nationally and internationally.
Orzech earned her bachelorâs degree in art from Smith College and an MFA from the University of Michigan School of Art and Design. She has served as a 2011 Fulbright Fellow in Printmaking at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in China.

The Office of Corporate, Foundation & Government Relations is here to assist you with your proposal preparation. The links below provide you with information, helpful hints and templates but please donât hesitate to contact us for assistance or additional information. 
Guidelines for Submissions
Proposals for grants for external funding that will be administered by Muhlenberg College (funds are paid to and disbursed by the College) and/or grants for fellowship opportunities (funds are paid to the faculty member) must be reviewed and approved before they are submitted to the funding agency. Please follow the steps listed below to prepare, receive internal approvals and submit your proposal.

Notify the CFGR office of your intent to submit as soon as possible â even if you eventually decide not to proceed. Please include a link to the program announcement or request for proposal in your initial email.
Begin a project budget using one of the templates provided in the "Preparing Your Budget" section below.
If another institution will be collaborating on the grant/program please provide the appropriate grant contact information at the institution to the CFGR office as soon as possible.
Schedule a meeting with CFGR to review your timeline for proposal development and submission.

We have also included a Proposal Worksheet that may assist in developing your proposals.

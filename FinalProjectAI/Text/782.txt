 Feminism and Pornography: An Analysis of SuicideGirls.com
For years, there has been an ongoing debate in America over the con-troversial issue of pornography. Whether it be in the form of a photograph, a film, or even a piece of literature, the genre of pornography isone that forces all types of people to question their own values, beliefs,and thoughts about sexuality. Pornographic materials, and their possible effects on society, have caused a heated debate among the feministcommunity in America. While some feminists assert that pornographyaids the fight for womenâs liberation, others claim that these types ofmaterials perpetuate gender-role stereotypes and promote violenceagainst women. This essay not only summarizes the two conflictingfeminist viewpoints on pornography, but applies these viewpoints to amodern pornographic website, SuicieGirls.com. SuicideGirls.com hasgained popularity largely because of the mission of its founders to pro-vide an alternative to the mainstream pornography that is available toadults. By using qualitative methods to analyze different sections of thewebsite (photos, message boards, etc.), I concluded that although thereare certain aspects of the website that may contribute to the degrada-tion of women, overall, the website portrays women in a positive way:celebrating their sexual freedom and expression, giving them powerover their bodies, and de-objectifying them. SuicideGirls.com exempli-fies the ways in which pornography has the ability to aid feminists intheir fight for equality between genders. Furthermore, this website haspaved the way for the depiction of women in pornography, and in themedia as a whole.

Background B.S., Wittenberg University (Ohio) M.A.T., Smith College
Mrs. Conrad began teaching French at a junior high school in Massachusetts while working on her Master's degree. She has also taught part time at Mount Union College (Ohio) and Monmouth College (Illinois). In addition to teaching French she has worked in a hospital with her degree in Respiratory Therapy and directed the Academic Support Services at Monmouth College for ten years.
In addition to teaching part time in the Evening College, Mrs. Conrad writes children's poetry and shares her work with various children's groups.
Mrs. Conrad likes particularly the introductory levels of French and helping the students learn to appreciate second language acquistion. Her students have done a variety of special projects, one of which led to writing to a French novelist whose work they were reading and receiving a personal response from him.

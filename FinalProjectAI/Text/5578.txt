baseball sweeps gettysburg


In two very different types of games, the Muhlenberg baseball team wrapped up a 4-0 Centennial Conference week by sweeping an important doubleheader at Gettysburg, 4-0 and 14-9.

The two wins put the Mules (16-13, 7-5) into sole possession of fourth place in the

CC with six league games remaining. The sweep was Muhlenberg’s first in a road CC twinbill since 2003 and its first at Gettysburg since 1994.

In the opener, sophomore Phil Cresta needed only 62 pitches to toss his first career complete-game shutout, the first by a Mule since 2003. The southpaw allowed only three hits, struck out three and finished with a flourish, retiring the last 10 hitters.

The Muhlenberg softball team saw its losing skid reach 10 games with a home doubleheader loss to Haverford. 

The Mules (5-21, 2-8) managed just eight singles in falling, 8-0 and 3-0.

Sophomore Allie Saltstein had two of the singles and has hit safely in six of the last seven games.

when the Bullets (14-17, 6-6) placed runners on first and third with nobody out. A ground ball to third cut down the lead runner at home, and another runner was thrown out on an attempted double steal.

Muhlenberg scored a single run in four separate innings, two coming in on suicide squeeze bunts by junior Eric Hammond. Junior Christian Conti scored the other two runs after leading off innings with extra-base hits.

Junior John Kalis singled with one out in the second for his 100th career hit.

The second game featured more offense. The Mules broke open a 1-1 game by scoring six runs in the second. Sophomore Eric Pomroy drove in the first two runs with a single, and junior Edward Risener followed with a two-run double. A double by Kalis brought in Risener, and senior Joe Carlo singled in Kalis.

Muhlenberg upped its lead to 11-2 with a four-run fifth. Three runs came in on errors and the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Risener, who knocked in four runs in the game to increase his season total to 43, topping the old school record of 41. He is still three RBI behind Conti in the race to establish the new record. Risener did tie the school record for sacrifice flies in a season (six).

Gettysburg rallied with two in the fifth and five in the sixth to cut the Mules’ lead to 12-9, but junior Joseph Barrese came in to slam the door, pitching the last three innings to earn his third save. Barrese set the Bullets down without a hit in the seventh and eighth, then got a game-ending double play after two runners reached on infield singles in the ninth.

Muhlenberg added two insurance runs in the top of the ninth, an inning that featured another successful bunt by Hammond, who also went 3-for-5 in the game. Sophomore Dan Fisher was 3-for-4 with three runs scored in the nightcap.

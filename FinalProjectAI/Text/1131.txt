Talk by Mary Toulouse (Lafayette College)
In this one hour, hands-on workshop, participants had an opportunity to create an i-book template for student-created projects in the foreign language class. Topics addressed in the workshop included: setting up a template, adding multimedia features, exporting the books, and widgets that enable language spellchecks in over 35 languages. Rubrics for grading were available. Demo samples from Lafayette College included: Intermediate student French history i-Book projects, Intermediate student Japanese i-books, and advanced Spanish i-books. Demo samples from Swarthmore College included: the i-book, as used as a tool to support literacy among hearing impaired students.

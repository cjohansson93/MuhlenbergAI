Cross Country Gallops Through Snow at CC Championships
 Saturday, October 29, 2011 - page 2







					 





It was a snow-swept morning at the CC Championships.



The Centennial Conference cross country championships were held at Big Spring High School, but a more appropriate name for the venue would have been Big Winter.



Snowy conditions made the course challenging to say the least, but it did not stop the Muhlenberg women from reaching their goal. The Mules came in fourth, matching the best finish in program history.

The Muhlenberg men were sixth for the second year in a row.




Newcomb was the third freshman to cross the finish line.



The women, who last finished fourth in 2004, improved their standing at the CC meet for the third straight year. They were led by junior Samantha Mayden, whose sixth-place finish earned her All-CC honors. She is only the fourth Mule female to finish in the single digits, and the first since 2005.

Muhlenberg finished well behind Johns Hopkins, Haverford and Dickinson, the top three teams in the region, but held off Gettysburg by 10 points for fourth place. Mayden beat the Bullets’ top runner by 14 places, and after that everyone else in the Mules’ top five was within three scoring places of her Gettysburg counterpart.

Junior Erica Bash was Muhlenberg’s No. 2 runner, placing 29th – up from 60th last year and 86th as a freshman. Sophomore Nicki Cronin (33rd) and seniors Melissa Ugelow (41st) and Kimberlee Yalango (50th) rounded out the team’s top five. 

The Muhlenberg men’s team had five underclassmen in its top seven. Freshman Kieran Newcomb was the Mules’ top runner in 34th, four places ahead of senior William Lowrey. Newcomb is the first freshman since 1994 to be the Mules’ top runner at the CC Championships. (corrected 10/31)

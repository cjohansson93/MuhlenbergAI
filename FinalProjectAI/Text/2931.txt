women’s soccer bows in ncaa first round





Muhlenberg has plenty of young talent to make more runs at the NCAA Tournament in the future. The Mules started the game with three sophomores, including Nicolette Miller (above), and two freshmen.



The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team put up a good fight against a bigger, more physical opponent, but Ithaca put in a late goal for a 1-0 win in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. 

The 15th-ranked 



Christina O’Grady and her fellow seniors finished their career with a record of 44-24-7.




Bombers (15-4-1) advance to face host William Smith, a 2-0 victor over Simmons, in the second round, while the Mules end their season with a record of 12-7.

Muhlenberg had its best scoring chance late in the first half. In the 36th minute, sophomore Meghan O’Grady beat a Bomber defender and got loose for a 
one-on-one shot with Ithaca goalie Jessica Platt. Platt came out to challenge and got there just in time to make a diving stop on O’Grady’s shot, which was headed toward an 
open net.

The first half ended with the Bombers holding a slight 5-3 edge in shots, but they began to take over in the second half. Muhlenberg stayed in the game thanks to the
exceptional play of sophomore Michele Toher, who stopped several breakaways and point-blank shots. She finished with seven saves.

Ithaca’s goal was set up by Rachael Palladino, who forced a turnover by the Muhlenberg defense and went in alone on net. Palladino’s shot was saved by Toher, 
and the rebound fell to Amy Scheffer at the top of the penalty area. She carried the ball toward the goal, taking a low shot from 8 yards was stopped by the defense, 
but she pursued the rebound near the goal line and nudged the ball over the line with 11:15 remaining.

The Mules managed one shot – their only one of the second half – after the goal, but senior Christina O’Grady’s try was saved. Muhlenberg
was shut out only twice all season, in the first game and in the last game and both times by teams from upstate New York.

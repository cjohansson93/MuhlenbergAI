The Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies announces the next offering of its accelerated Bachelorâs degree program in Business Administration with a concentration in Healthcare Management. Classes will begin in June 2022. 
This blended learning program provides the opportunity for network employees to complete their degree with a combination of in-person and online class sessions. Classes meet one evening per week. Subject to the networkâs approval per evolving COVID-19 practices, in-person classes will meet in an LVHN ECC classroom. 
Applications are now being accepted. The application fee is waived for LVHN employees, and those who participate in the June cohort will be granted three courses tuition-free. Textbooks and technology fees are included in the tuition. The College has a tuition deferment program, and a Muhlenberg advisor will guide students through the Financial Aid process to explore funding to supplement LVHN tuition reimbursement.
Employees with roughly the equivalent of an Associate degree are potential candidates for this accelerated program, although an earned Associate degree is not required. Previous college coursework will be evaluated to determine an applicantâs readiness for the program. 
The cohort will be limited to the first 18 students accepted, so please inquire as soon as possible. 
Interested individuals are strongly encouraged to request further information using this link: https://gceadmissions.muhlenberg.edu/register/lvhn

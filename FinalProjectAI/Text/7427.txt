The Muhlenberg men’s golf team rallied to tie for fourth at the Centennial Conference Championships, held at the
DuPont Country Club in Wilmington, Del. It was the best finish for the Mules in three years.

Muhlenberg made up eight strokes in the final round to tie Dickinson for fourth. Closer to sixth (five strokes ahead) than to fourth after the
second round, the Mules easily finished ahead of sixth-place Gettysburg by 13 strokes.

Muhlenberg was the only school in the field to lower its score from the previous day in both the second and third rounds. Its 54-hole total of 946 was its lowest
since 2011.



Senior Christopher Lucarelli (right) shot in the 70s in all three rounds to tie for 10th with a 230, four strokes better than last year, when he tied for
ninth. His 4-over-par 75 in the second round tied for the sixth-best on Saturday.

Sophomore Jonathan Graulich and freshman John Froberg, each completing the three-day tournament for the first time, finished
in the top 20 with matching scores of 238.

All five Mule golfers shot at least one round in the 70s, with with senior Chris DiMaio firing a 79 in the final round of his career and
freshman David Barkley carding a 78 in the middle round.

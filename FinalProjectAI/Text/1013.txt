About Coronavirus











          What is COVID-19 and how does the Coronavirus spread?
  








COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus through an outbreak that began in Wuhan, China in December 2019.  The disease spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. Droplets land on objects and surfaces other people come in contact with these objects or surfaces and can catch the virus from touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People are also able to catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
 






          Who is most at risk from Coronavirus?
  








Anyone can catch COVID-19, but people with weak or compromised immune systems, particularly older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.






          What are the symptoms of Coronavirus and how can we protect ourselves?
  








The CDC says that the symptoms of COVID-19 coronavirus are fever, cough and shortness of breath which can appear 2-14 days after exposure. Please keep in mind that these are also symptoms associated with other types of infections.Things you can do to protect yourself:

Keep your immune system healthy by getting plenty of sleep, maintaining good nutrition, finding stress-relief and exercising. 
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.







          If I have traveled to an affected area or been potentially exposed to COVID-19, what should I do?
  








If you answer âyesâ to any of the following conditions, please contact the Dean of Students Office if you are a student or Human Resources if you are an employee.

Have had a known direct exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19;
Have been instructed to isolate or self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms;
Have been notified by someone that you might have been exposed to COVID-19 directly;
Have a fever, cough or shortness of breath;
Have visited a travel warning Level 3 country.

If you do not meet any of these conditions, you may return to campus, though please continue to follow all preventative recommendations (hand washing, etc.) from the CDC.  









Campus Facilities & Events In response to Pennsylvania Governor Wolfâs recent declaration of March 19, all campus buildings will be closed to the public.  Limited card access will be available to faculty, staff and students approved to remain on campus. 
At this time, we are requiring College departments to cancel or postpone all events through April 13. College-sponsored events occurring after April 13 should notify participants that events are subject to cancellation at a later time. Additionally, campus facilities are closed to external and co-sponsored groups and events are cancelled until further notice. If you serve as a point of contact for any external or co-sponsored group, please communicate this information accordingly.   
We also ask for your assistance in communicating cancellations of your events to relevant offices that were scheduled to provide support for your events and meetings. Any changes to a 25Live reservation should be communicated using the Change/Cancellation Form. Please remember to cancel any reservations and associated services such as work orders, catering, media services, housekeeping overtime, equipment rentals, etc. that may no longer be necessary as a result of a modified or cancelled event.

Muhlenberg seniors Chris Galletta and Matt Parker both advanced to the consolation finals to earn places at the Centennial
Conference Championships.

The Mules finished ninth, just a half-point behind eighth-place Washington and Lee.

Galletta won the consolation final to place third. The heavyweight (pictured at right on the podium) went 3-1, with his first and last wins coming
against the same Washington and Lee opponent. Galletta pinned him in the opening round but need multiple overtime periods to capture the consolation final and
secure third place. 

Galletta lost a close 5-3 decision in the championship semifinals to an Ursinus wrestler with whom he split two close matches in the regular
season. In the consolation semis, Galletta avenged an overtime loss to a Johns Hopkins wrestler two weeks earlier with a 2-1 decision.

Parker likewise faced the same opponent in his first and last matches, winning 10-8 in the opening round but falling 8-7 in the consolation final to come in
fourth. He also defeated a Washington and Lee opponent, 3-0, in the consolation semis.

 
Freshman Che Chengsupanimit (left), who did not defeat a CC opponent during the regular season, won by major decision against a Gettysburg foe in his first
consolation bout.

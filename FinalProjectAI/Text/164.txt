On Thursday, May 6, the College will celebrate the groundbreaking of the new Parkway Boulevard Building on the south side of Muhlenbergâs campus.

Scheduled for completion in Fall 2022, the three-story building will reside on the hillside between Chew Street and Parkway Boulevard and serve as a new home for the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Program, Institute of Public Opinion, School of Graduate Studies, School of Continuing Studies and Office of Community Engagement. The building will also house art studio space.
A transformative $7.5 million gift received in 2020 is providing significant support for this capital project as well as the expansion and enhancement of The J. Conrad and Hazel J. Seegers Union. The donors, who wish to remain anonymous at this time, are a Muhlenberg alumnus of the 1970s and his wife.
Speakers at the May 6 groundbreaking event will include President Kathleen Harring, Richard C. Crist '77 P'05 P'09, chair of the Muhlenberg College Board of Trustees, and Scott Kelly, co-founder and principal-in-charge at Re:Vision Architecture.
State Representative Michael Schlossberg '05 and Allentown Mayor Ray OâConnell are both scheduled to speak at the event as well.
Muhlenberg Collegeâs Parkway Boulevard Building is one of the first 20 projects in the world to pursue CORE certification.

Image by Re:Vision ArchitectureLiving Building Challenge (LBC) Core Green Building Certification (CORE) is a framework that outlines the 10 best practice achievements that a building must obtain to be considered a green or sustainable building by the International Living Future Institute (ILFI). LBC is a certification program, advocacy tool and philosophy defining the most advanced measure of sustainability in the built environment today. 
Highlights of the Parkway Boulevard Buildingâs holistic and deep sustainable design include:

Native landscaping, which does not require irrigation or petrochemical fertilizers and works to restore the natural ecology of the site
Support for low-carbon and human-centered transportation with covered bike storage, shower facilities and electric car charging stations
A rainwater recycling system, which in conjunction with low water consumption flush and flow fixtures, will reduce building water consumption by over 50%
70% energy use reduction through efficient HVAC and lighting systems, a super-insulated envelope, passive-solar orientation and a 60kw rooftop solar panel array
Exceptionally high levels of indoor air quality utilizing continuous fresh-air ventilation and a green cleaning protocol
Utilization of locally sourced low-toxicity and low-embodied carbon materials
A fully accessible building and landscape providing universal access to a corner of campus previously only accessible via stairs
Utilization of a third-party diversity and inclusion assessment tool to benchmark the design and construction teams
Utilization of biophilic design principles to create a space that engages humans in direct and indirect experiences with nature
Educational elements woven throughout the building and site creating a teachable resource out of the building 

In addition, Muhlenberg Professor of Ornithology & Conservation Biology Dan Klemâthe worldâs foremost authority on bird collision and bird-safe glassâand Acopian Ornithological Specialist Peter Saenger, worked with the team at Re:Vision Architecture to ensure that the windows in the building will have bird-safe coatings.

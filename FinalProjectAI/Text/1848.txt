FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Students with disabilities engage in the full range of experiences available to all Muhlenberg College students including curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities. For additional disability-related information including documentation requirements, check the Office of Disability Services website. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions:












          When should I notify Muhlenberg about my disability?
  








Students with disabilities do not need to disclose their disability status or condition during the admission process, however it is recommended that students disclose as soon as possible after being accepted and having formalized the decision to attend. The Office of Disability Services offers phone consultations to assist in many areas in the orientation to Muhlenberg. Whenever possible, students should disclose their disability status or condition before the June Advising Event. By disclosing early, students will be invited for a special pre-advising session with a Disability Services Specialist during June Advising Event, before their meeting with a faculty advisor.






          Who should I contact regarding my disability?
  








Students with documented disabilities who may need accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services should consult with the Office of Disability Services to initiate the disability determination process. If a studentâs disability documentation results in a determination of eligibility for accommodations and services, an Accommodation Plan is developed. An Accommodation Plan provides accommodations that are consistent with the documentation findings and which do not alter essential elements of a course or compromise the academic integrity.






          What accommodations will I receive?
  








Accommodations are determined case-by-case basis with consideration given to the documentation, evaluator recommendations, previously history, and the impact nature of the diagnosed condition.  In all cases, a determination of eligibility for accommodations is dependent upon the documentation supporting a significant limitation in a major life function. (Documentation must clearly connect with and support the requested accommodation). If the documentation is incomplete or does not support the requests, further information may be requested. Requests for accommodations that alter the essential elements of the course or compromise academic integrity will not be approved. Please refer to the Documentation Guidelines and Accommodations section on the website for more information.






          If I received 504 accommodations or had an IEP in high school, will the same accommodations be provided?
  








Section 504 Plans and IEPs are helpful in understanding the history of the studentâs disability or disorder and may provide valuable information about previously employed accommodations and services. At the post-secondary level, these documents serve as supplemental material to the evaluative documentation. Some accommodations received in a high school setting may not be appropriate for the college setting, such as unlimited time on tests or exams. At the post-secondary level, supporting documentation through an evaluation done within the past 3 years or using adult norms would be required. (Please refer to the Documentation Guidelines). An excellent resource for the comparisons between the IDEA, 504, and the ADA can be found at the US Department of Education website.

In certain instances, students with disabilities that impact foreign language acquisition may petition for an exception to academic policy, (Substitution or Pass/Fail); in mathematics (Pass/Fail if not required for the studentâs major course of study). The Office of Disability Services staff would work with the student to guide them in this process.

Emily Strong
Corporeal Landscapes
June 14 - August 1, 2019

Coalesce, 2019, oil on board, 40" x 32"
Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to present Corporeal Landscapes, a solo exhibition by Emily Strong in the Galleria space. This exhibition features about a dozen works that will be on public display throughout the summer adjacent to the Paul C. Empie Theater, in our Philip Johnson-Designed Baker Center for the Arts.
Strongâs figurative landscapes invite contemplation of physicality through painted, fleshy abstractions. By creating raw, intimate spaces she explores the many complexities of physical relationships; with the self and with others. This series is a celebration of flesh and form, and body positivity is a central theme in this series. The compositions do not shy away from rolls or folds; rather it lingers on them, gently guiding the viewer through the topography of the forms. In this way, she hopes to show that these are not features to be ashamed of, but treasured as part of being human. By focusing on these vulnerable moments, not including any other objects, background, or personal identifiers, it invites the viewer to consider the flesh exclusively within its own context.
Emily Strong was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1992 and received her undergraduate degrees in Fine Art and Psychology from Moravian College of Bethlehem, PA in 2015. Strong works predominantly in oil on canvas, exploring representational figurative and natural works. In addition to her personal studio practice, she is a freelance mural artist, curator, collections archivist, and artist's model. She currently has a studio in Fountain Hill, PA.

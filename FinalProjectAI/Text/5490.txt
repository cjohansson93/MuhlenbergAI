Kasza named player of the week



Sophomore Jess Kasza of the Muhlenberg field hockey team was named defensive co-player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Kasza was part of a defense that allowed preseason Empire 8 favorite Hartwick to take only four shots in the Mules’ 2-1 home-opening victory. 
She also scored the game-winning goal, converting a penalty corner with 6:50 left in the second half for her first career goal.

Kasza, who scored one point all last year, has notched a point in both games in which she has played so far in 2008.

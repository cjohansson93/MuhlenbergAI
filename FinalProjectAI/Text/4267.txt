softball splits with elizabethtown



There were some alarming things that happened in the Muhlenberg softball team's home-opening doubleheader against Elizabethtown.

Alarming in a bad way was the Mules' squandering

of an eight-run lead for the second time in five games. Muhlenberg led 8-0 after two innings in the second game, only to have the Blue Jays tie the score on a grand slam in the fifth.

Alarming in a good way was the Mules' ability to bounce back from adversity time and time again. Down to their last strike in the first game, they rallied to tie the score, although Elizabethtown went on to win in extra innings, 5-3. And they shook off the stunning comeback by the visitors to immediately take the lead in the bottom of the fifth en route to gaining the split with a 10-9 win.

Alarming in a most annoying way was the car alarm that blared constantly during the Mules' seven-run first inning in Game 2.

The bats for both teams took a while to get going, but once

they did, they didn't stop. The first game was scoreless until Muhlenberg plated two runs in the bottom of the sixth on doubles by freshman Kelly Kline and senior Alyssa Epstein and a double steal. 

Elizabethtown (7-4) came back with three in the top of the seventh. In the bottom of the inning, senior Ashley Brewer hit a two-out, two-strike drive off the top of the fence, just missing a game-tying home run, but she came around anyway when Kline singled.

The Blue Jays scored on a wild pitch and solo home run in the top of the eighth, and this time the Mules could not come back.

Showing no apparent effects of the tough loss, Muhlenberg (6-3) took advantage of poor Blue Jay fielding to score seven runs in the first inning of the second game. Brewer and junior Brittany Blohm hit RBI doubles in the big frame, which was aided by four Elizabethtown errors.

With the score tied 8-8, senior Alyssa Epstein - who had thrown out a runner at home plate from right field in the third - led off the bottom of the fifth with a single. With two outs, freshman Colleen O'Donnell doubled in pinch-runner Jessica Costa with the go-ahead run.

The Blue Jays tied the score once more in the top of the sixth. In the bottom of the inning, Brewer led off with a single (her third hit of the game) and was sacrificed to second. Senior Jess Kasza followed with a bloop that the centerfielder made a dive for but could not catch. Brewer rounded third and appeared headed for a close play at the plate, but the catcher could not hold on to the throw from the outfield.

Sophomore Angie Sisco set Elizabethtown down 1-2-3 in the top of the seventh to put an end to the wild doubleheader.

By scoring 10 runs in the second game, the Mules reached double figures for the fifth time this season. That surpasses their total from the last three years combined; they hadn't had five 10-run games in a season since 2000.

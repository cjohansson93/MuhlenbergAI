In a game that came down to the final play, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team dropped its Centennial Conference opener at
Haverford, 80-77.

The Mules (3-2, 0-1) faced their biggest deficit, eight points, with two minutes left before using their press to climb back into
the game. Junior Alec Stavetski was fouled while attempting a three-pointer and made all three free throws
with 13.2 seconds to play to make it 78-77.

Haverford (2-2, 1-1) made a pair of free throws with 10.5 on the clock, and the game looked to be over when Muhlenberg
missed a potential tying three-pointer. But the Fords missed two free throws, and the Mules called timeout after grabbing the
rebound with five-tenths of a second left. THe inbounds pass was deflected away, however as the final buzzer sounded.

Senior Malique Killing scored 18 of his team-high 21 points in the second half. Stavetski finished with 16, 
and sophomores Jon Schreer (11) and John Hunter (10) also scored in double figures.

Junior Nick Melosky (right) scored Muhlenberg’s last five points of the first half. The Mules 
led by six at the break and by as many as 11 in the second half.

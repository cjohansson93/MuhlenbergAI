The Muhlenberg volleyball and women’s soccer teams both suffered their first Centennial Conference losses of the season at Johns Hopkins.

The volleyball team was swept in three sets, 25-11, 25-14, 25-17. At left, senior Jackie Price
puts down one of her team-high four kills.

In women’s soccer, a pair of goals at the start of each half spelled doom for the Mules.

The No. 7 Blue Jays (8-0, 2-0), ranked second in the region, put in a pair of rebounds, one in the second minute and one in the 46th minute. They added a third goal in the 74th minute to wrap up a 3-0 win.

Muhlenberg held a 7-4 advantage in corner kicks and had a pair of good scoring chances but could not break the Blue Jays’ 540-minute unscored-upon streak.

Sophomore Stephanie Tramutola sent a rocket into the box in the 44th minute that went through the hands of the Hopkins goalie, but the Mules (4-3-1, 1-1-1) could not get a foot on the rebound 
before it was cleared away.

Then in the 55th minute, freshman Colleen Touhey rifled a shot from just inside the box that was bobbled by the keeper, but she was able to pounce on the ball before it crossed the line.

Appendix K. Suggested email to solicit applications from students
We are seeking students to serve on the College’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). All research involving human participants that is conducted under the auspices of Muhlenberg College, by its faculty, students, and staff, is subject to oversight by IRB, the committee charged with reviewing all such research and experimental activities prior to their commencement. The full committee is composed of three elected faculty members and a community representative in addition to the student member.
Students who may find this work especially interesting and rewarding are those who have engaged or plan to engage in research with human participants while at Muhlenberg, in graduate studies, or as part of their professional career.  Students will need to demonstrate integrity, a respect for confidentiality, and ability to work well with faculty and members of the community. 
A student member will typically be called upon to review up to five research proposals per semester and meet with the committee to discuss ethical considerations of the proposed research.  If selected, a student must be willing to serve for the entire coming academic year and consider serving for a second year; however, juniors may still apply.
If you are interested in the opportunity, please submit the attached application to the IRB Chairperson no later than April 1.  Please note that a recommendation from a faculty member is required as well.  If you have any questions or would like further information about the work of IRB, please contact the IRB Chairperson.

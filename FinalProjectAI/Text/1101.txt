Update to Masking Requirements



A message to the Muhlenberg community

Friday, July 30, 2021

Dear Muhlenberg Community,
Given the rapid increase in COVID-19 due to the highly contagious Delta variant, all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear face masks in all College owned buildings and facilities until further notice, effective Monday, August 2. Masks are not required when an individual is in their assigned living space by themselves or with only designated roommate(s), suitemate(s), or apartment-mate(s), when working in a private, single-occupancy room and when actively eating and drinking.
Throughout the pandemic, we have adjusted our COVID-19 safety measures as new information becomes available. We will continue to monitor the situation and will adjust our masking policy as we are able. In addition to masking, COVID-19 vaccination continues to be our best protection against this virus. The higher the percentage of vaccinated persons we have on our campus, the more protection we will have.
We thank you for the commitment and flexibility you have shown as we continue to prioritize our communityâs health.
Regards,
Allison Gulati, Vice President, Student AffairsBrynnmarie Dorsey, Executive Director of Health & CounselingJill Walsh, Vice President for Human Resources

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in diversity and inclusion and in Muhlenberg College. Here at Muhlenberg, we are committed to welcoming and supporting a diverse community of learners and educators within an inclusive environment, one in which all of our differences are encouraged, validated and respected.
The collective work of students, staff and faculty members to develop, maintain and grow our community inclusively is represented on these pages. Within our website, you can get caught up on the work of the Presidentâs Diversity Advisory Council and see the progress we are making on the Collegeâs strategic initiatives. You can check out opportunities to get involved on campus and in the community with Multicultural Life, Religious Life and the Office of Community Engagement. You can explore opportunities to learn to engage areas of difference through active listening and dialogue through the Intergroup Dialogue and Peer Partner programs. And perhaps most importantly, you can share your ideas with us for making our community more welcoming and inclusive for everyone.
Whether you are a current student, staff or faculty member or alumnusâor a prospective member of the Muhlenberg communityâwelcome! I hope this website will be a resource for you to explore all of the events, services, activities and opportunities that promote, strengthen and celebrate diversity, inclusion and equity at Muhlenberg.

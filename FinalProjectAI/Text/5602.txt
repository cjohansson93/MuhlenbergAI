Baseball Swept at F&M



The Muhlenberg baseball team played two very different types of games – a slugfest and a pitchers’ duel – in its Centennial Conference doubleheader at Franklin & Marshall, losing both.

In the opener, the Mules (10-11, 1-3) trailed 5-0 after two innings. A two-run double by freshman Bobby Spindler was the big hit in a four-run top of the fourth, but the Diplomats (7-9, 3-1) answered with four runs of their own in the bottom of the inning.

Trailing 9-4 in the top of the fifth, Muhlenberg tied the score with five runs after the first two batters struck out. Junior Eric Hammond singled in two runs, and sophomore Dan Fisher knocked in the tying run with one of his three hits.

F&M regained its lead with single runs in the fifth and sixth. The Mules loaded the bases with one out in the seventh, but could score only one run and came up one short, losing 11-10.

Senior Joe Carlo went 3-for-4 with a double in the opener.

The nightcap was dominated by freshman Kevin Witmier of Muhlenberg and the Dips’ Brad Andres. Witmier had his finest start to date, shutting out F&M for the first five innings and pitching into the eighth. Andres, however, had a no-hitter going until freshman Clint Lynch singled with two out in the eighth. That was all the offense the Mules could muster, and they lost 5-0.

doubleheader at Muhlenberg because its bus never showed up. The Mule bats also were late in arriving, but they eventually appeared.

Shut out for the first four innings, Muhlenberg scored 11 runs in the next four – the last two innings of Game 1 and the first 2 of Game 2 – and swept the Diplomats, 8-4 and 4-1.

The Mules were looking to wipe the slate clean in their first 
CC games of the season after scoring only eight runs in a seven-game losing streak. But things did not look promising when F&M (1-11, 0-2) scored twice in the first and twice in the third to take a 4-0 lead.

Muhlenberg finally broke out in the fifth, taking advantage of fielding mistakes to produce its biggest inning of the year. All six runs scored with two outs.

With runners on first and third, freshman Alyssa D’Addio brought in the first run with a single. Infield errors on consecutive batters plated another run, and a bases-loaded walk to junior RiRi Ferrigno made it 4-3. Freshman Jess Kasza singled to tie the score, and the go-ahead runs came in on yet another error.

Ferrigno singled in one of two insurance runs in the sixth.

The bats stayed hot at the start of the second game, as D’Addio led off with a double and freshman Alyssa Epstein followed with a single. Two outs later, Kasza singled down the left-field line to bring in both.

The Mules (5-11, 2-0) extended their lead to 3-0 the following inning when freshman Lauren Fedor singled, went to second on a throwing error and third on a wild pitch, and scored on a single by sophomore Katie Smithson.

A two-out double by junior Samantha Crist knocked in a fourth run in the bottom of the fifth. 

That was more than enough for freshman Alyssa Bruckner, who pitched an outstanding game against a Diplomat team that started the day with a CC-leading .313 team batting average. Bruckner allowed only five singles over the first six innings and was one out away from her first career shutout before F&M strung together four singles to score a run in the seventh.

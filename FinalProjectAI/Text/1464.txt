Dear Fellow Members of the Muhlenberg Community,
I suspect that many if not most of you have been touched, as I have, by cancer. Whether it affected one of your friends, a member of your family, or you yourself, the news of a cancer diagnosis is always a sobering reminder of our own mortality - and that of those we love. Fortunately, we have made tremendous strides in fighting and curing cancer in recent decades. This progress didn't happen by itself, but resulted from prolonged, persistent, focused scientific research supported by the contributions of individuals and communities who are determined to fight this cruel disease.
Relay for Life is an important part of this fight, and I am proud that, year after year, our students take the lead in organizing a Relay for Life here in the Muhlenberg community. This year, in memory of my brother Kennedy who died last month of a rare form of bone marrow cancer, I am supporting Muhlenberg's effort with my time, energy, and resources. I invite you to do the same. Here are the details:
1) Relay For Life is a 12 hour event that benefits the American Cancer Society. Participants walk and participate in ceremonies to celebrate, remember, and fight back against cancer. The event raises money to fund cancer research as well as help cancer patients with everyday needs such as transportation to treatment or a place to stay with support while being treated.
2) You can register or contribute to Muhlenberg's event at
www.relayforlife.org/pamuhlenbergcollege
3) The event is held at Parent's Plaza on Sunday, April 28, from 9 am - 9 pm. In addition to the walk, the organizers have scheduled We student performers and other activities like tie dye, a bounce house, an inflatable slide and an obstacle course. There will also be a raffle.
By the way, one of the ways in which people participate is to register for the walk as a team with friends and family members (there is a $10 registration fee per person). If anyone wants to join my team, just let me know by Thursday.
Cordially, Randy Helm

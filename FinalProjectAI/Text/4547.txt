volleyball fallsin playoff rematch



In a rematch of last year's Centennial Conference first-round playoff match, Swarthmore defeated Muhlenberg in three sets.

Playing without their regular setter, the Mules had their best chance in the second set. After dropping the first set, they jumped out to a 9-2 lead in the second, taking their biggest lead 
on a block by senior Caitlin Dombkowski (right) and junior Brooke McQueen. But the Garnet came back with the next six points and ultimately took the set, 
25-18.

Freshman Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare had two of her three aces at the start of the second set and finished with a team-high 6 kills.

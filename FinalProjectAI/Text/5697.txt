faust qualifies in first track meet



Tartar Pins Down Title



Joe Tartar wasn’t on the mat for long – less than the equivalent of one full bout – but he made the most of his time.

The Muhlenberg senior pinned three straight opponents in a total of 4:59 to win the 285-pound bracket at the Washington and Lee Invitational. The title was the fifth of his career, including his second straight at W&L.

The three pins gave Tartar 32 for his career, moving him into second place on the Mules’ all-time list.

Junior Justin Fitch was Muhlenberg’s other champion, winning his first career tournament at 174. 

The Mules finished third out of seven teams.

Alex Faust truly picked up where she left off last year in the first meet of the season for the Muhlenberg track and field teams.

Faust broke her own school record and hit the NCAA provisional standard in the pole vault with a height of 11-7 at Franklin & Marshall’s Coach “I” Invitational. She set the previous record of 11-6½ in the last indoor meet of 2007, her freshman season.

Faust also won the 55 meters and 200 meters and ran on the first-place 4x400 relay team at the small meet, which featured two other teams (Franklin & Marshall and Albright).

The Mules recorded first-place finishes in seven other events, including one by freshman Kim Bier in the mile in her first career meet. 

Sophomore Jeremiah Lachaud won the 55 and place second in the 200 for the men, and sophomore Brendan Kirk won the 55 hurdles with a time (8.51) that wasn’t far off his 2007 season best (8.37).

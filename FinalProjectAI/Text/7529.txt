Offenses Quiet as Softball Splits, Baseball Falls

Warmer weather is supposed to favor hitters over pitchers, but things did not come easily for the batters on the Muhlenberg softball and baseball teams 
on the nicest day of the season to date.

Softball scored three runs on only six hits in its doubleheader split with Haverford, while baseball managed just a run and three hits in a 5-1 loss at Ursinus.

In the softball opening game, junior Kelsey Jones pitched a five-hitter to improve to 7-1 on the season. The 2-1 win gave the
Mules their first 5-0 Centennial Conference start ever; they were 4-0 in 1994 and 1997 but lost their fifth game both times.

Muhlenberg scored all of its runs in the bottom of the third. After singles by sophomore Nicole Iannarone and 
senior Erica Wenzel, sophomore Taylor Trifiolis brought both home with a double to the fence in right.



Jones allowed a run in the top of the fourth but retired 11 of the last 12 hitters she faced to preserve the one-run lead.

The Fords (12-4, 1-1) took the nightcap, 9-1. The Mules (13-3, 5-1) scored their lone run without the benefit of a hit in the bottom of
the fourth. Sophomore Brittany Dzieciolowski had both Muhlenberg hits.

The doubleheader began a stretch of six games in six days for the Mules against the other three 2013 CC playoff qualifiers.

The baseball team couldn’t bring its bats out of a deep freeze, managing only one hit through the first eight innings.

The Mules (7-10, 0-2) finally broke through on back-to-back two-out doubles by junior Jimmy Cody and senior John Scuderi in the ninth inning, but by then it was too little, too late. 
Scuderi’s two-bagger finally chased the Bears starter, but a groundout ended the rally.

Sophomore Josh Schoen (right) struck out four, including the side in the seventh, over two scoreless innings in relief.

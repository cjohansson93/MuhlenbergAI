Track Teams Tune Up; Bauer Breaks Jav Record Again

Baseball Swept at No. 3 Hopkins


The Muhlenberg baseball team wrapped up CC play by losing a doubleheader at third-ranked Johns Hopkins, 15-2 and 6-5 in 10 innings.

The Mules (19-19, 7-11) finished with a four-game improvement in their CC record from last year and can reach the 20-win mark for the fourth time in program history by winning one of their final two games, at DeSales on Monday and home vs. Drew on Tuesday.

Senior Joseph Vila doubled in the lone Muhlenberg runs in the first game two move to within two of tying the school record of 113 career RBI.

In the nightcap, the Mules trailed 5-0 after seven before making a late rally to force extra innings. They scored two runs and brought the tying run to the plate in the eighth, then added two more in the ninth on a single by senior John Muha. After Muha motored around to third on an errant pickoff throw, junior Max Litvak delivered a pinch-hit single to bring in the tying run.

The Blue Jays (33-5, 15-3) ended the upset bid in the bottom of the 10th on a bloop hit over a drawn-in infield.

Muha had three hits in the doubleheader to push his school-record career total to 193 and move into a tie for eighth place on the CC all-time list.

Ready or not, here come the Muhlenberg track and field teams.




The teams combined for 10 all-time Muhlenberg top-10 performances, including two by the Faust sisters, freshman Katrina (above) in the 400 hurdles and senior Colette
in the high jump.




In their final tuneup before next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships, the Mules had some impressive performances at the Lehigh Games.

The highlight came Friday night. A day after senior Samantha Mayden of the women’s team posted the third-fastest time in Division III in the 5,000 meters at the Penn Relays, sophomore Tyler Bauer also landed in the top 10 on the national performance list. His javelin throw of 208-10 broke the school record he set earlier this season by seven feet and landed him at No. 8 in Division III. Bauer finished first among college throwers, and his distance is the best in the CC this year by almost 25 feet.

Three Mule relay teams took first place, with the men’s 4x100 team of juniors Max Suitovsky, Andrew Onimus, Darnell Davis and senior Isaiah Vaughn posting an ECAC-qualifying time of 43.75.

Others to qualify for ECACs included junior Stephanie Carnevale in the 100 and 100 hurdles, junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski in the 100 hurdles, senior Erica Bash in the 800, senior Colette Faust in the high jump and freshman Jessica Thimmel in the discus.

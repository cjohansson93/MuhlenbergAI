wrestlers open up at king’s


The Muhlenberg wrestling team opened up its 2009-10 season by finishing seventh out of 10 teams at the Monarch 



Sophomore Kevin Homan missed placing by one win, going 3-2 at 141.




Invitational, hosted by King’s.

With five of the 12 Mules who competed getting 
their first taste of collegiate wrestling, the tournament was a good starting point for the team. The strong field included three teams ranked in the top 30 in Division III (Wilkes, Oneonta State and York) as well as the Army JV team.

Muhlenberg finished one point ahead of the only other Centennial Conference team in the tournament, Gettysburg.

Nine of the 12 Muhlenberg wrestlers won at least one bout, and three earned places. Sophomore John Sternlicht finished fourth at 165, coming back strong after dropping his initial bout to the eventual runner-up. Sternlicht won five straight bouts in the consolation bracket, three by pin and one by technical fall, before dropping a 6-4 decision in the consolation final to the top seed.

Junior Keith Swanson earned a fifth-place finish at 157. After losing a close 3-1 decision to the second seed, he dropped into the consolation bracket, where he won a pair of one-point decision.

Although he wrestled four bouts, sophomore heavyweight Nick Pallotta saw the least mat time of any Muhlenberg competitor. All his bouts ended in pins and took a total of 2:40. After getting pinned in 29 seconds, Pallotta turned around and pinned his next two opponents in 16 seconds and 30 seconds to reach the consolation final, which he medical forfeited.

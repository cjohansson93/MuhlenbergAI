As we embark on the spring semester, we understand that the campus may be concerned about the possibility of the spread of the flu, which has recently received significant media attention.  As of the first week of January, there is widespread flu activity in Pennsylvania and most of the United States.  The majority of influenza viruses circulating are influenza A (H3N2). 
The College is continually monitoring the situation and preparing for the probable arrival of this flu on campus this semester.  We have been tracking information provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).   We also have a close relationship with the Allentown Health Bureau who has provided us with a limited supply free flu vaccine  this year.
This site is your link to campus specific information about the seasonal flu.  Check back often for important updates.

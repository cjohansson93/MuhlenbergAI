Womens tennis flies by blue jays




There was no need for any luck of the Irish for the Muhlenberg womens tennis team in its outdoor opener against Elizabethtown.

The Mules swept all three doubles matches with relative ease and took four of six in singles as they beat the Blue Jays, 7-2.

After Muhlenberg (1-1) dominated doubles play with 8-1, 8-1 and 8-2 wins, seniors Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker scored straight-sets victories at No. 1 and No. 2 singles to clinch the match.

Classmate Lindsay Schmidt added a straight-set win of her own at No. 5 singles, which left Danielle Winston (right) as the lone Mule on the court.

After taking the first set, 7-5, Winston started to cramp up during the second.

Wincing in pain with almost every point, the senior needed to be stretched out by Muhlenbergs training staff before dropping the second set, 3-6.

Sitting on the court to try to loosen her legs before the tiebreaker, Winston said she knew she did not have much left. But she was able to gut out a 10-5 win in the tiebreak to grab her second win of the day before collapsing on the court.

It was Muhlenbergs fourth straight win over the Blue Jays (3-3). And Winston said she was determined to finish her singles match, even if it meant playing through her leg cramps. 

All I had left was serve and volley, Winston said as she lay on the ground in pain. I dont know if Ill be able to even walk off the court. But Im really glad I was able to get the win.

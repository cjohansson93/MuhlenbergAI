Men's Cross Country Wins Race at Paul Short
 Saturday, October 5, 2013 - page 4







					 





It’s been more than a month since the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team ran a race without winning it.

The Mules, competing for the first time since winning the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational two weeks ago, took first place in the “White” race at
the Paul Short Run, hosted by Lehigh at the site of this year’s NCAA Mideast Regional.

That race was the last of the meet, one of the largest cross country gatherings in the country. Due to excessive heat that caused several runners to be
transported to the hospital, the remainder of the meet (including the race the Mule women were scheduled to run in) was cancelled.

The men finished first in a large field of 42 teams, including four from the Centennial Conference and six from Division II. Muhlenberg was 10 points ahead of 
second-place Juniata and 57 in front of third-place CC rival Franklin & Marshall.

This is the third time in program history that the Mules have won two invitationals in the same season; the other two were 1997 and 2000.

Junior Luke Munyan came in 15th in a field of 324 to pace Muhlenberg. Freshman Jaryd Flank and sophomore Stephen Sroka
finished back-to-back (20th and 21st), and junior Kenny Wohl (left) crossed the finish line in 33rd place. Junior Zach Lifman
rounded out the top five in 42nd place.

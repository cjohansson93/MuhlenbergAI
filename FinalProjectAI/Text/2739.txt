conti named to all-regionfirst team


Christian Conti of the Muhlenberg baseball team added another to his list of accolades when he was named to the American Baseball
Coaches Association-Rawlings Mid-Atlantic All-Region first team.

Conti is now a candidate for the 2008 ABCA-Rawlings All-America Team, which will be released later this week at the NCAA Division III College World Series. 

The outfielder was voted Centennial Conference player of the year, All-Centennial Conference first team and Academic All-District second team after a tremendous 
junior season in which he hit .380 and set school records for runs (49), triples (11), home runs (11), RBI (60), extra-base hits (29) and total bases (116). One of his 11
round-trippers was the game-winning blast in a victory against Washington that clinched the Mules’ first playoff berth in five years.

Through games of May 18, Conti led Division III in triples and triples per game (0.28) and also ranked seventh in RBI per game (1.50) and 15th in slugging percentage (.817). 
He is believed to be only the second player in Division III history to reach double figures in triples and home runs in the same season.

Conti is the first Muhlenberg baseball player named to the all-region first team. The only previous all-region selection in program history was Justin Graf, a second-team pick
in 2003.

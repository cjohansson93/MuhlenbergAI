Despite missing a few key athletes on a holiday weekend, both Muhlenberg cross country teams were very competitive 
at the Paul Short Run. The men finished ninth out of 22 teams and the women eighth out of 35 in the “White” races.

The men were paced by sophomore Jaryd Flank, who finished eighth out of 147 runners with a time of 26:13. 
Senior Luke Munyan posted a 26:54, slotting him 21st on the day. Seniors Zach Lifman (27:35) and Josh Elkan (27:49) each finished in the top 60.

Junior Melanie Tramontina crossed first for the women with a time of 23:13, good enough for 18th place out of 229 runners. Freshman Mallory Snyder (left) finished 25th with a time of 23:25, while junior Claire Thornton (23:56) and freshman Emily Davidson (23:59) 
cracked the top 50.

Junior Jen Mermelstein made a couple of nice saves to keep the game scoreless in the first half,
but the Red Devils scored two goals in a span of 33 seconds early in the second half.

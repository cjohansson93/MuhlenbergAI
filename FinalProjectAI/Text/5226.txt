In 1997 the number one song in the country was Elton John’s Candle in the Wind. The Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl. And 1997, according to The Terminator and The Terminator 2, was supposed to be the year that Skynet would launch a nuclear attack on mankind. Oops. 
1997 was also the year that 



Junior Danielle Scarrone scored three goals for her third career hat trick.



Bryn Mawr last beat the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team. The Mules kept their streak alive with an 18-3 victory, their fourth win in a row. 
Muhlenberg (6-1, 2-1) was able to get all 25 of its players on the field. 
“It’s important everyone get their shot,” said senior Marguerite Farrell. “We had a lot of different people scoring and helping out on defense. It shows how much depth we have and how we’re ready off the bench in any situation.” 
Muhlenberg scored early and often, finding the back of the net three times in the first 2:40 and scoring nine more times in the first half. Junior Amanda McGovern was responsible for five of those goals, securing a hat trick less than 15 minutes into the game. 
The Mules added another six goals in the second half. Three other players also recorded hat tricks for the Mules. McGovern had a team-leading and career-high eight points with six goals and two assists to become the third different Muhlenberg player to score at least eight points in a game this season. She also led the team with four draw controls and three caused turnovers. 
The Mule defense held the Owls to one goal in the first half; Bryn Mawr did not score their other two goals until late in the second. Farrell and junior Ashley Foltiny scooped up four ground balls apiece, and Farrell caused two turnovers. 
The three goals were the fewest Muhlenberg allowed in a CC game since 2003, when they beat Bryn Mawr 15-3.
“Every conference game is important,” said Farrell. “We have key upcoming conference games and it was really important to set the tone for those today.”

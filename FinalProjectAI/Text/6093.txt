Junior Matt Parker of the Muhlenberg wrestling team grabbed his second win of the season during a quad match at Wilkes with York and Delaware Valley.

Parker (left) finished 1-2 on the day at 141 pounds with a 7-3 win against Delaware Valley.

He was the only Mule that competed, so Muhlenberg did not register a team score.

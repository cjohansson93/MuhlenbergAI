International Baccalaureate credit equivalencies
Official International Baccalaureate transcripts should be received by the Muhlenberg College Registrar's Office before the beginning of the fall term and no later than the last day of a student's initial fall term.
IBO only accepts the student's request on an IBO transcript request form submitted to them by mail (not fax) and full details and fees are outlined on the IBO website. Transcripts are forwarded electronically from the IB office to the Muhlenberg College Registrar once students have authorized the release of results to Muhlenberg. Unofficial score reports, not received directly from IB, (e.g., from the high school or from the student) are not accepted by Muhlenberg for awarding degree credit.
Muhlenberg College will consider for credit or advanced placement only IB courses with Higher-Level examination results of 5, 6, or 7. With the exception of philosophy, Standard-Level results do not receive Muhlenberg credit. Specific credit and placement policies are available on this page, accessible at muhlenberg.edu/IB. IB scores that result in Muhlenberg credit or placement are posted on your Muhlenberg record, and can be viewed on your Workday account.
Student record, under Academics, then External Records. Some departments count IB credit toward their major requirements; some do not. Please consult with the appropriate department chair.
Credit is granted at the discretion of the department head(s) involved, according to the following departmental policies in place for the coming fall term. IMPORTANT: If you receive credit for one of the following, make sure that you don't register for the same Muhlenberg course number or you will lose your IB credit.

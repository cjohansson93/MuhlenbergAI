Muhlenberg Football's Nick Savant Named to the D3football.com Team of the Week


The junior running back was honored for his performance in Saturday's home game against Gettysburg.


	 Wednesday, October 19, 2016  08:43 AM

Savant recorded 100 yards rushing and receiving, scoring three touchdowns in the Mules' 43-7 win. He rushed 28 times for 114 yards - his fifth consecutive 100-yard game - and a 4-yard score while catching seven passes for 145 yards and a pair of 42-yard touchdowns. He is the first player in team history to have 100 yards rushing and 100 yards receiving in the same game.
For the season, Savant leads the Centennial Conference and ranks 21st in Division III in rushing yards per game (126.2). In just 18 games, he already ranks 11th on Muhlenberg's all-time list in career rushing yards (1,461), just 39 away from the top 10.
This is the 18th season that D3football.com has selected the Team of the Week, which honors the top player nationally at each position from the previous week. Savant is the 17th Mule named to the Team of the Week, the first since tight end Michael Long two years ago.

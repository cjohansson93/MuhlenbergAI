three advance to second day at petrofes



Three Muhlenberg competitors guaranteed themselves of places by making it to the second day of the Messiah Petrofes Invitational.

The lone Mule alive in the championship bracket is senior Matt Horn. Seeded second at 184, Horn (right) won two decisions to advance to
the semifinals against the third-seeded Wilkes wrestler.

At 174, senior Justin Fitch was defeated in the second round, but came back in the consolation bracket, earning a spot in the consolation semifinals
with an overtime upset of the third seed.

Freshman Nick Pallotta had an impressive run through the consolation bracket after dropping his second bout to the sixth seed. The unseeded heavyweight pinned his first
two opponents (including the No. 8 seed) in the wrestlebacks, both in the first period.

Late Big Innings Drop Baseball at Shenandoah
 Sunday, March 23, 2014







					 





The Muhlenberg baseball team had a four-run lead in the middle innings on the road against a nationally
ranked opponent, but Shenandoah scored nine runs in the sixth and seventh for a 10-6 win.

The Hornets (15-4) are ranked 18th in Division III by D3baseball.com.

An RBI single by senior Brett Rosen and a bases-loaded walk to junior Chris Flynn gave the Mules (6-8) a 2-1 lead
in the second.

Muhlenberg extended its lead to 5-1 by scoring three runs without the benefit of a hit in the fourth. Three walks,
three wild pitches and a sacrifice fly by junior Kurt Johnson made up the “rally.”

Junir Nick Gies held Shenandoah to one run and two hits over the first five innings and got the
first two batters out in the sixth. But the Hornets ended up scoring four runs to tie in that inning.

Senior Nick Kennedy broke the tie with an RBI single in the top of the seventh before Shenandoah
came back with five runs in the bottom half.

Rosen (left) had two of the Mules’ five hits.

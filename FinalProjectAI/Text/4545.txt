Mens soccer draws with drew



While the result was a history-maker for the Muhlenberg mens soccer team, it left the Mules less than completely satisfied.




Plifka is the 16th different Mule to score a point and the sixth to score his first career goal this season.




Muhlenberg took the lead early in each half, only to see Drew come back each time as the regionally ranked, non-conference foes finished in a 2-2 tie.

Danny Way got the scoring started for the Mules (7-0-5) when he took a pass from Jacob Joseph and struck it in the left side of the net six minutes into the game. It was Ways seventh goal of the season, and gave Joseph assists in back-to-back games.

Jason Daniels made a leaping save on a free kick six minutes later to keep the Mules ahead, but in the 16th minute, Muhlenberg was called for a foul in the box. Drew (10-1-2) scored on the ensuing penalty kick to tie the game, 1-1.

The two teams traded plenty of scoring chances, and even more pushes and shoves. A total of 36 fouls were called, and one yellow card was handed out, in the physical game.

Twelve-and-a-half minutes into the second period, the Mules were in business again as Joseph lined up for a corner kick. The ball was 



Field Hockey, Women's Soccer Fall at Swarthmore



The Muhlenberg field hockey team could not keep its momentum rolling as it fell at Swarthmore, 3-0. Kristen Dornenburg made 13 saves in the cage for the Mules.

After falling behind by two at the break, the Muhlenberg womens soccer team pulled within one on an own goal, when a Swarthmore back put the ball in her own
net while attempting to clear a corner kic. But the Mules would not get any closer as they fell to the Garnet, 2-1. Michele Toher made a career-high 
15 saves, the most by a Mule since 2006. (changed 10/15/10)

turned away by Drew, but right back to Joseph.


The freshman lofted a cross into the box and the ball bounced off several players from both sides. No one could gain control until Kyle Plifka 
got the ball at his feet. The sophomore back unleashed a shot that flew past the Ranger goalkeeper to put Muhlenberg on top, 2-1.

It was the first goal, and points, of Plifkas career. It was also some redemption for last season, when Drews game-tying goal in last seasons game came on a penalty kick after a Plifka handball in the box. 

But with less than 10 minutes to play in regulation, the Rangers made a push down the right side. Daniels came out of the net to try to grab a crossing pass, but the ball bounced through and ended up at the feet of a Drew midfielder, who tapped it into the back of the open net to re-tie the game.

Muhlenberg had four corner kicks and fired four shots in the second overtime, but could not find the winner.

With the tie, Muhlenberg has not lost in 12 games this year, breaking the school record for longest unbeaten streak to start a season. The Mules also extended their regular-season unbeaten streak to 19 games (12-0-7) and remained one of nine unbeaten teams in the country after No. 1 Christopher Newport lost for the first time.

Women’s Basketball Drops Third Straight



A slow start and difficult finish kept the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team from handing Johns Hopkins its first loss in Centennial Conference play.

The Blue Jays scored 14 of the game’s first 17 points and nine of the last 12 to edge the Mules, 65-58, in a back-and-forth battle between the league’s top two programs. Johns Hopkins (7-2, 6-0) will carry a perfect conference mark into the holidays, while Muhlenberg (4-3, 2-2) dropped its third straight.

In a game featuring seven ties and 13 lead changes, the Mules trailed 14-3 before five minutes had ticked off the clock, but slowly battled back and set off a tight second half. Junior Laura Gregory put back an offensive rebound to tie it for the 11th and final time (53-53) with just under eight and a half minutes remaining. But the Blue Jays scored on their next possession and never trailed again as the Mules missed eight of their last 10 shots.

Pepe  tied a season high with 11 points to lead a balanced scoring effort for Muhlenberg, adding four rebounds and making a trio of three-pointers. The Mules went 6-for-11 from distance in the first half, including a deep three by junior Abby Stenger to cap a 13-0 run and put Muhlenberg ahead, 25-23, with 7:53 on the clock. From then on, neither team led by more than six points until the final two minutes.

Junior Leanna Tallamy scored eight points and pulled down a team-high 12 rebounds for the Mules. Junior Janelle Fleet also scored eight, tying her career high, and dished out a team-best three assists.

Freshman Jaryd Flank enjoyed a successful first tournament with the Muhlenberg wrestling team, finishing fourth at 125 at the Messiah Petrofes Invitational.

Flank, who joined the team after running cross country for the Mules in the fall, dropped his opening bout to an opponent from Springfield who is ranked
sixth in Division III by D3wrestle.com. Flank then worked his way back through the
consolation bracket. After pinning a Bridgewater wrestler, he scored a 4-2 decision against a foe from the host school. A medical forfeit put Flank in the consolation
final, where he lost by major decision to the same Springfield opponent who pinned him.

Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit (below) won a consolation match at 149 for the Mules, who finished eighth out of nine teams.

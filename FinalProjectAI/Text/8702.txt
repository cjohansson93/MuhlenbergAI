Important Financial Aid Changes:


2021-2022 Academic Year




Muhlenberg College no longer requires the CSS Profile for need-based aid. Students who wish to be considered for need-based financial assistance must complete the FAFSA and the Muhlenberg Scholarship and Aid Application.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will be available on October 1st. Packaging is based on Prior-Prior Year tax information. The FAFSA should be completed using tax information from two years prior. The 2021-2022 FAFSA will be completed using 2019 tax year data.

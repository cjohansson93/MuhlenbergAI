The Egner Memorial Chapel and the Department of Music are proud to present the 2021 Advent Candlelight Carols Service, adapted from the Festival of Lessons and Carols of Kingâs College, Cambridge University in England.
Each year, the Muhlenberg and surrounding Allentown Community gather for three Candlelight services to mark the season of Advent. The service features the congregational singing of traditional Advent carols, readings of scripture by members of the College community and musical offerings specially prepared by the College's Choirs and Department of Music.
Muhlenberg College welcomes all who wish to join together in community to mark this special time of year. Although Candlelight Carols is a Christian tradition and service, we invite people of all faith backgrounds to join us as we reflect on common themes of hope and beauty.
The 2021 Advent Candlelight Carols program will be held Saturday, December 4 at 7:30 p.m., Sunday, December 5 at 3:30 p.m. and Sunday, December 5 at 7:30 p.m. The 7:30 p.m. Sunday service will be live streamed and open to the public; viewers do not need to register to view the service online.

In order to prioritize the safety of the Muhlenberg community and guests to Candlelight Carols performances, the following safety measures have been taken: capacity has been reduced by more than one-quarter; proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required prior to December 1 to avoid forfeiture of tickets/reservations; masks will be required during the service and KN-95 masks or 3-ply disposable masks will be available for all attendees who wish one; we reserve the right to make changes to the schedule depending on the regional changes in COVID-19 infection rates.
Tickets are non-transferable between individuals unless the individual can produce their proof of COVID-19 vaccine at the door. There will be no exceptions.

Brueckner is a member of the class of 1971. Laurie Cameron Brueckner, his wife, graduated from Muhlenberg in 1972. Two of their children decided to attend Muhlenberg; Eric graduated in 2004 and Sydnie is a member of the class of 2009.
“Colleges like Muhlenberg thrive only when their graduates commit themselves to strengthening their alma mater,” says Dr. Peyton R. Helm, President of Muhlenberg College. “The Brueckner family exemplifies the ideal. Rich and Laurie are wonderful examples of alumni who support the College in so many ways. We are extremely appreciative of the loyalty, commitment and leadership that the Brueckners have shown.”
Brueckner, who assumed his responsibilities as Chair of the Board in July, is Chief Executive Officer of Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. He is a governor of the NASD and director of the NASD-Regulation, Inc. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Securities Industry Association and is a trustee of the Foundation for Investor Education. He has earned the Baker Award for Advancement of Economic Literacy from the National Council on Economic Education, as well as an award for outstanding service to the capital markets from the American Museum of Financial History.
Laurie Cameron Brueckner is a trustee of the Gill St. Bernard School in Gladstone, N.J., and of the Friends of Vanderveer Knox House in Bedminster, N.J.
"Muhlenberg has been an important part of our lives for over 30 years and are we are very pleased to make this commitment to the College,” says Brueckner. “It is our responsibility, and a privilege, as graduates who have benefited from the Muhlenberg experience to ensure that this experience is available for future generations. We hope our support plays a role in making this happen, and sets a leadership example for alumni and students.
The new building includes a large co-ed weight room and cardio-fitness facility overlooking the athletic fields; an athletic training suite; new men’s and women’s locker rooms; coaches offices; team meeting rooms; a conference room; the Student Health Center; the Counseling Center; and the Powerhouse Café. Renovations of the existing building included a new classroom; new field house flooring and netting; new offices for student organizations; and a Pilates Center.

Become a Doing Groundwork Facilitator Doing Groundwork facilitators are a small cohort of students, faculty and staff who work toward a campus community that embraces difference and the unique experiences that everyone inherently possesses. During a two-day, overnight retreat and training weekend, participants will engage in dialogue centered on topics of diversity and inclusion. Upon completion of the training, facilitators will design and facilitate workshops and presentations that can be requested by faculty, staff, and student groups. Questions?

chili nets player of the week honor



For the second time this season and the fifth time in her career, junior Alexandra Chili of the Muhlenberg womens basketball team was named player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Chili averaged 27.7 points per game in a 2-1 week for the Mules. She scored the teams last seven points, including the game-winning basket with 1.3 seconds left, in a 61-59 win at Ursinus. Chili also tied a school record with her fourth career 30-point game in an overtime loss at Johns Hopkins, and she capped the week with a 25-point, 5-assist, 0-turnover performance in only 22 minutes vs. Washington.

By scoring 32, 26 and 25 points in the three games, Chili became the first Muhlenberg player to reach the 25-point mark in three consecutive games since Anne Searles in 1986-87.

For the season, Chili leads the CC in scoring at 21.8 points per game, more than five ppg more than the second-leading scorer. She has made a CC-leading 51 three-pointers and is third in the CC in free-throw percentage (.840).

Chilis scoring surge last week put her into 25th on the CC all-time scoring list with an even 1,300 points. With 224 career three-pointers, she is just 19 away from breaking the CC all-time record. 

The Mules are 12-4 overall and 8-3 in the CC, a game behind first-place Johns Hopkins in the loss column. The two teams are scheduled to meet in Memorial Hall on Saturday with first place on the line.

Michael Hull  Class of 2010 Dual Major in Media & Communications and Theatre
Associate Producer, Actor





‌‌‌
After 'Berg, I moved to New York City to pursue a career in theatre. I've been really lucky to be working consistently in the “New Musical Theatre” scene. In 2011, thanks to a networking connection from Muhlenberg, I took a contract as an assistant director to a Tony Award-winning director/producer, which eventually led to my current position as an associate producer at his Broadway production company.
‌It's been a fantastic experience and has helped me find a passion for producing that I didn't know I had, while still letting me work toward a performing career. I've never been more thankful for my liberal arts education, which gave me all the skills to navigate my field from so many unique viewpoints.

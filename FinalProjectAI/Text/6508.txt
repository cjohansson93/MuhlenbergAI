Women's Soccer Answers the Call, Shuts Out Bryn Mawr

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team came ready to play in its Centennial Conference game against upstart Bryn Mawr. And so did its goalie, although she didn’t know she was going to play when she came to the field.



Junior goalie Amanda Wong was called on to start in the net just minutes before the opening whistle after starting goalie Francesca Cobuzzi was injured at the conclusion of warmups.




“I was wishing the best for Francesca and hoping she would be ready to play. But when Coach called me in, I knew I had to be there for the team,” said Wong.


And she certainly was, right until the end of the game when she made a diving save in the 77th minute to preserve the 4-0 shutout win.


“It felt good to finally get out there, and hearing my name called out was a great confidence boost for me,” said Wong, who started the first three games of the season before getting injured herself.



Several of her teammates also got confidence boosts at various points throughout the game.



Freshman Macayla Baer came off the bench toward the end of the first half and scored her first career goal just two minutes later. Baer put away a shot inside the box after her classmate Taylor Pini tapped the ball to her past a sliding Bryn Mawr goalie.



“You never know when it’s your time, so you just have to come out and make it count. Macayla took that into a great assault on the goal,” said Wong.



Pini’s offensive onslaught did not end when the first half came to a close. She netted her second career goal just over five minutes into the second half off a cross from senior co-captain Alyssa Meola.


Freshman Jacelin Muschlitz (left) got her first career goal in the second half, thanks to another well-placed pass by Pini. Last, but not least, sophomore back Krissy Fioretti (right) found the back of the net with an arcing shot from the left corner of the 18-yard box for her first career goal.


“We always speak about being prepared and that no matter who is in the game, we have to come out big and strong and take advantage of everything,” added Wong. “It was great to see Macayla, Jacelin and Krissy get their first goals.”


The Mules’ goals were the first allowed by Bryn Mawr in nearly 400 minutes of soccer. Prior to this afternoon, the Owls had given up a total of four goals in their previous seven games. Bryn Mawr came into the game off two consecutive ties, including one against Franklin & Marshall, which qualified for the Centennial Conference playoffs last season.


“When we heard that Bryn Mawr won against McDaniel, who we lost to earlier this season, and tied with F&M, we knew we had to come out big,” said Wong. “So we worked a lot on one touches and two touches in practice this week.”


Muhlenberg (5-6-1, 3-2) took 22 total shots on the day, its most since a Sept. 1 victory over Penn State Altoona, when it recorded 25. The Mules’ four goals were the most since the five they scored in that same game, and their goal count against the Owls (3-4-3, 1-2-2) equaled the combined total from their previous eight games. 


“We want to continue to show the confidence we have and that we deserve to be in the playoffs this season,” said Wong.

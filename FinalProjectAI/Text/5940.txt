Despite Loss at Dickinson, Men's Soccer Still in Driver's Seat for Playoffs
 Wednesday, October 26, 2011 - page 2







					 



Most people get cases of the Mondays at the start of the work week, but the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team has caught a case of the Wednesdays.

The Mules fell at Dickinson, 1-0, on Wednesday in a matchup of the two teams tied for second in the Centennial Conference. Muhlenberg is now 0-4-1 in its last five midweek games.

Even with the loss, the Mules, ranked sixth in the region, can clinch a berth in the conference playoffs with a win or tie against Ursinus on Saturday. The Mules have qualified for the CC tournament every year since its inception in 2001. 

The Red Devils (9-4-3, 6-2) came out fired up in their home finale, but Muhlenberg (9-5-1, 5-3) weathered the early surge and started to counter midway through the opening half. The two teams went into the break tied, 0-0.

Dickinson, ranked 10th in the region, created some solid chances just after halftime, but junior Kyle Plifka (left) cleared a ball away from an open net in the 53rd minute. Then sophomore Jas Chojnowski got his foot on a shot while sprawled out on the ground to save another potential goal less than 10 minutes later.

In the 67th minute, Dickinson struck on a counter attack off of a Mule free kick.

As the minutes ticked away, the tension on the field picked up, and the tackles got harder. There were eight fouls called and three yellow cards awarded in the final 20 minutes of play.

Muhlenberg’s best chance for an equalizer came when junior Nate Squire sent a cross from the right side into the box in the 78th minute, but the header from junior Danny Way sailed just wide of the right post.

Chojnowski finished with a career-high 11 saves, the most by a Mule goalie this season. Muhlenberg moved to 0-4-1 in its last four trips to Carlisle with three of the games decided by one goal.

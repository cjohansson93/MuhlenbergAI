Women's Lacrosse Runs Away with Home Opener
 Wednesday, March 6, 2013 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse game against Eastern began two hours earlier than originally scheduled to avoid an impending winter storm.




In addition to her goal and assist, Brown had one of the Mules' 21 draw controls.



And like the expedited start to the game, both offenses hit the ground running. Eastern struck first and the teams exchanged goals for the first several 
minutes of play. Every time Eastern scored, Muhlenberg put one away less than a minute later, and the game was tied at four goals apiece after about 12 minutes of 
play.

That’s when senior Molly Davin took control to give the Mules their first lead and propel them to a 19-5 win.

Just 12 seconds before she scored the go-ahead goal, Davin recorded her 100th career point on a flawless assist to sophomore Stephanie Umbach. She had entered the game just two points shy of the milestone and this assist, along with a goal scored earlier in the game, made her just the 20th player in program history to reach the century mark.

But Davin wasn’t done there.

She scored her second goal in just over four minutes, and her third of the game, to give the Mules a 6-4 edge with just over 13 minutes until halftime, forcing Eastern to call a timeout.

“We came out a little bit slow, but during [Eastern’s] timeout we talked about having the second slides in the defense and really putting pressure on them where we could,” said senior defender Alexandra Franck. “We also talked about getting the ball out in transition and into the offense.”

The talk worked. The offense tied a school record with 15 first-half goals, and the defense allowed just one more goal in the remaining 13:17 of the half and prevented Eastern from getting off a single shot in the second half.

Franck anchored the defense with three caused turnovers and, along with Umbach, tallied four ground balls.




Armstrong recorded her first career point with an assist on Davin's third goal, which gave Muhlenberg a 6-4 lead.



“We really wanted to focus on rebounding from the loss [to Lebanon Valley],” explained Franck. “We’re on spring break so it was a little different from a normal home game, but it was still our home opener so we wanted to work together as a team to pull out the win.”

Umbach and Davin led the team with five goals and two assists apiece. Senior Alex Bellini had two goals and junior Michelle Certosimo and senior Ali Gabriele had one each.

With 12:55 remaining in the half, Gabriele found Umbach streaking toward the goal and the sophomore buried her shot. Muhlenberg won the ensuing draw control and this time, in almost identical fashion, Certosimo found Gabriele and she scored the Mules’ second goal in 11 seconds to give them an 8-4 lead.

Four Mule freshmen scored their first career goals – Arielle Sherman had two and Casey Armstrong, Callie Brown and Brigid Noone had one apiece. Brown’s came early in the game to tie the score at two, and she also assisted on Noone’s goal with just eight seconds remaining in the game. Armstrong also added two assists.

“I’m sure some of them were nervous, but they had nothing to worry about,” said Franck of the freshmen who notched their first career points. “They game out and did and awesome job. I’m sure they’re all pretty excited about it and I know we’re all really happy for them.”

Muhlenberg held a 21-5 advantage over Eastern in draw controls. Umbach led the team with 11, one away from tying her own school record for draw controls in a game, and Certosimo added six.

“I think it’s really going to help us moving forward,” Franck added of the win. “Last year we had a bit of a tough season with losing five games by one goal. I think this game is going to be a huge confidence booster for us and hopefully we can build on it and get a few more wins in the future.”

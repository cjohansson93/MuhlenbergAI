Blocked kick downs football


On third and 10 with a little more than a minute to play in the fourth quarter, Isaiah Vaughn found some space in the Moravian secondary.

The Muhlenberg wide receiver was streaking toward the end zone when quarterback Dan Deighan spotted him and delivered a perfect pass.

Vaughn hauled in the catch to give the Mules a chance to tie the game with the extra point.




Nadell averaged 31.7 yards per kickoff return, including a long of 41.




But the Greyhounds got pressure and broke through the Muhlenberg line to block the kick. The Mules could not recover the ensuing onside kick, and Moravian held on for a 14-13 win over their Lehigh Valley rival.

"We kind of lost ourselves," senior linebacker Patrick McDonough said. "We had a bunch of mistakes in all three phases of the game. That was very uncharacteristic of us this season and it's very disappointing."

The Mules also had a field goal blocked in the third quarter and turned the ball over four times.

But thanks to a defense that stopped Moravian (6-4, 6-3) four times in Muhlenberg territory, the Mules were always in the game.

Chase Nadell picked off a pass deep in Mule territory to end a Moravian scoring threat just before halftime, and Kenneth Cobb forced a fumbled that was recovered by Matt Musick that set up Vaughn's touchdown.




Bobby Bushong caught five passes for 34 yards.



Vaughn finished the day with seven catches for 84 yards and a score to lead the Mule offense on a day that was controlled by the respective defenses. 

And while yards were hard to come by on the ground, Mule running back Terrence Dandridge finished with 59 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries, to bring his season total to 1,041 yards. He became only the second sophomore in Muhlenberg history to rush for at least 1,000 yards in a season.

But it was not enough against a Greyhound squad that has surged during the second half of the season and won five of its last six games.

Defensively, Cobb finished with two-and-a-half tackles for loss, including two sacks, and was in the backfield much of the day.

 McDonough, meanwhile, earned the Bianco Award as Muhlenberg's Most Valuable Player of the game after he finished with 13 tackles, including seven solo stops, and a sack.

But the senior said he would trade that award in a second if it would change the outcome.

"Most of those tackles are because of the guys up front making it easy for me," McDonough said. "It's nice to win it, but I would have much rather won the game than anything else."

Muhlenberg's  loss, coupled with wins by Ursinus and Johns Hopkins, means the Centennial Conference title will be shared by more than two teams for the fourth time in history. But the Mules still earned the conference's automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament by virtue of head-to-head wins against both the Bears and Blue Jays.

The Mules (7-3, 7-2) will learn their opponent for the first round at 3 p.m. Sunday when the bracket is unveiled during the NCAA Division III Championship selection show on ESPNews.

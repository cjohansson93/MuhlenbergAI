Women’s Tennis, Softball, Men’s Lacrosse Lose



Playing what amounted to a playoff match, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team lost to Dickinson, 5-4, in a match played indoors in York, Pa.

With a win, the Mules would have qualified for the Centennial Conference playoffs as the fifth seed. Instead, they finished a game out of the final playoff spot. 

Muhlenberg played 5-4 matches against four of the five CC playoff teams, going 1-3.

The Mules got off to a good start in their final CC match, winning two of three doubles matches, but the Red Devils, who will play in the CC semifinals, took four of six singles contests, all of which were decided in straight sets.

Freshman Jennifer Goldberg and junior Amanda von Taube won at both doubles and singles.

The Muhlenberg softball team was swept by Ursinus, 2-1 and 7-0. With the losses, the Mules dropped to fifth place in the conference, one game out of fourth, with one CC doubleheader remaining.

The Mules (15-19, 8-6) outhit the Bears (20-13, 9-5) in the opener, 10-3, but stranded 11 runners on base. Senior Brittany Blohm drove in Muhlenberg’s lone run of the day on a sacrifice fly in the seventh.

Freshman Kelsey Jones was the tough-luck loser yet again, striking out seven and not allowing an earned run in seven innings of work. She has surrendered runs in just three of her last 20 innings, but the Mules have only given her one run of support during that time.

Sophomore Erica Wenzel finished the day 5-for-7 at the plate.

Playing at home for the first time in three weeks and in rain that ranged from light to heavy, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team lost to Ursinus, 12-7.

The Mules’ two excellent faceoff men, senior Nick Rispoli and junior Ian Jones, combined to go 12-of-21 in the X, and each scored a goal off a faceoff win. It was the first career goal for Rispoli, who won 10 faceoffs.

Junior Doug Rheiner (2G, 1A) and Jack Reilly (1G, 2A) scored three points apiece for Muhlenberg (2-11, 0-7).

Just like Oreo cookies and jelly doughnuts, some of the best performances for the Muhlenberg track and field team were in the middle at the Greyhound Invitational hosted by Moravian.




Bash’s time in the 800 is the third-fastest in the Centennial Conference this season. 





Led by several school performance list times from their middle distance runners (who obviously don’t eat too may Oreos or doughnuts), the Mules had their second straight solid showing in Bethlehem in the past week. 

Junior Erica Bash made the biggest splash of the day, rising to second on the all-time performance list in the 800 with a time of 2:16.11. She placed fourth overall and was the only Division III runner to finish in the top nine in a race that saw the meet record get broken.

The Mules also got a pair of solid performances in the 1,500, where sophomore Nicki Cronin finished second on the women’s side, and junior Brendan Smith shaved more than eight seconds of his personal best for the men.

Three other men’s runners put up some fast times while taking a nice dip in the water on the warm day. Not only did senior William Lowrey (5th), sophomore Bobby McGetrick (6th) and junior Nate Crossette (8th) all place in the steeplechase, but they all did so in times that rank in the top six on the school's performance list.

Freshman Tyler Bauer continued to push further in the javelin, becoming just the fifth Mule since the javelin was redesigned in 1985 to throw at least 180 feet. His throw of 180-1 bettered his own top mark in the conference this season.

Fellow freshman Kirsten Kuchera moved up to eighth on the 400-meter performance list with a time of 1:00.80, and senior Peter Rice took fifth in the men’s 400 behind four Division I runners.

'Berg Named "A Best in the Northeast" College by The Princeton Review on its Website and Book



Muhlenberg College is one of the best colleges in the Northeast according to the nationally known education services company, The Princeton Review.  


	 Wednesday, August 4, 2010  11:45 AM

It is one of 218 institutions The Princeton Review recommends in its "Best in the Northeast" section of its website feature, "2011 Best Colleges: Region by Region," that posted August 2, 2010 on PrincetonReview.com. In it, it ranked the College’s theatre and dance department as sixth in the nation.                           The 218 colleges The Princeton Review chose for its "Best Northeastern Colleges" book and website list are located in eleven states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, and the District of Columbia.   The Princeton Review also designated 152 colleges in the Midwest, 120 in the West, and 133 in the Southeast as best in their locales on the company’s "2011 Best Colleges: Region by Region" lists.   Collectively, the 623 colleges named "regional best(s)" constitute about 25% of the nation's 2,500 four-year colleges.
For this project, The Princeton Review asks students attending the schools to rate their own schools on several issues – from the accessibility of their professors to quality of the campus food –  and answer questions about themselves, their fellow students, and their campus life.

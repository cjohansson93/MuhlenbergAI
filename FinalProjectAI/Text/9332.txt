'Berg Alumnus Mitch Slater '83 Establishes Scholarship Fund 



Muhlenberg College Parents Council members Mitchell âMitchâ J. Slater â83, Pâ13 and his wife, Pamela Pâ13 are providing additional support to The Talents Entrusted to Our Care Campaign with a six-figure leadership gift to establish The Slater Family Scholarship.

The scholarship will be awarded each year to a qualifying student who has financial need.  While an undergraduate at Muhlenberg, Mitch incurred debt for his tuition and college expenses; he understands the burden this places on students and their families, particularly in this economy.  The Slaters created this scholarship in consultation with their daughter, Lana ’13, who is a theatre major at Muhlenberg.
“We understand that there are people less fortunate who would appreciate the opportunity to attend college at Muhlenberg,” says Mitch, who graduated with a degree in business administration and communication. “Looking back on my college experience and receiving financial aid, I wanted to give someone else that chance.”
Mitch says his Muhlenberg education provided the foundation for his career in the entertainment industry. He has spent the last 25 years producing live events and concerts including the Billy Joel’s “Last Play at Shea,” the last concert event at Shea Stadium in July 2008.  Currently, Mitch is a founding partner of CKx, Inc., which owns the rights to the name, image and likeness of Muhammad Ali and Elvis Presley, the operations of Graceland and proprietary rights to the IDOLS television brand among others, Mitch says Muhlenberg is where he found himself and where he honed the people skills that ultimately led to his success.
Mitch had already completed a leadership pledge to The Muhlenberg Fund, an area he has supported for many years, before making a commitment to fund The Slater Family Scholarship. “I had a wonderful experience at ’Berg. This is the right time for me to give as generously as I can. I’m happy to support the Talents Campaign, and I hope the College continues to thrive.”

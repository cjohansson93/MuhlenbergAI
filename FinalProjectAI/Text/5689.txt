track teams improve in second meet



The Muhlenberg track and field teams took steps forward at their second meet of the season, Ursinus’ Collegeville Classic.

The Mule women finished sixth, and first among Division III teams, despite competing without some of their top athletes. The men were 11th.

Freshman Hannah Mitchell notched the teams’ best finish, coming in second in the 800 meters and landing sixth on the all-time performance list with her time
of 2:28.63. Sophomore Lauren Conicella won her heat and placed fourth in the same race, and both runners also were on the 4x400-meter team that notched a fourth-place
finish.

Freshman Kim Bier improved her time in the mile by eight seconds to 5:35.16, good for seventh in the meet and eighth on the performance list.

The men placed two runners in the top five in the mile. Junior Timothy Van Syckle ran the ninth-fastest mile in team history (4:29.98) and finished fourth, one
spot ahead of sophomore Patrick Thornton.

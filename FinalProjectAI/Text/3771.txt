men’s Soccer ranked 25th


The Muhlenberg men's soccer team is ranked 25th in the first D3soccer.com poll of the 2010 season, released last night.

Earlier this week, the Mules came in fourth in the first National Soccer Coaches 



Association of America regional ranking of the year. The D3soccer.com poll mirrors
the NSCAA rankings for the Mid-Atlantic Region, with Johns Hopkins, Swarthmore and Messiah ahead of Muhlenberg.

This is the second time Muhlenberg has shown up in the D3soccer.com poll, which debuted last year. The Mules were 21st in the second-to-last poll of the 
2009 regular season, and they have appeared in the NSCAA national top 25 in four different years since 2003.

The Mules opened the season with 5-0 wins against Marywood and Centenary and improved to 3-0 by shutting out Wilkes, 4-0, last night. In the three games, they
have outshot their opponents 62-7.

The opposition figures to get more challenging when Muhlenberg hosts New York University on Saturday. NYU is 2-1, with its lone loss coming to No. 16 Stevens in overtime.

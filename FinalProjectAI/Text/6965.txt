Yesterday, Snow. Today, Sweep - Softball Takes Two from Swarthmore
 Tuesday, March 26, 2013







					 

 Men’s tennis honor


When snow fell in Allentown yesterday morning, covering grassy areas in white, it did not look like the Muhlenberg softball team would get to play its home Centennial Conference doubleheader against Swarthmore. But the temperature rose, the snow melted, and the field dried out in time for the Mules to start raining down some offense.




This was the 18th career reception at home plate for Kline (25), who is hitting .500 and has 24 RBI in 16 games this season.



The Mules piled on 18 runs and 20 hits in the last nine innings of their twinbill, sweeping the Garnet, 9-2 and 9-3, to improve to 12-4 overall and 3-1 in the CC.

Leading the outburst was junior Kelly Kline, who hit a home run and drove in five runs in the two games, becoming the 12th player in CC history with 100 career RBI.

The offense backed the solid pitching of sophomore Kelsey Jones and senior Angie Sisco, who combined to hold Swarthmore (9-5, 0-2) to 11 hits and four earned runs.

The Mules, who were shut out in their last game, did not get a hit in the first three innings of the opener and fell behind 1-0. In the bottom of the fourth, Kline led off with a walk and went to second on the first hit of the game, a single by junior Erica Wenzel. Both runners scored on ground balls.




Sisco scattered seven hits and got 15 of her 21 outs on ground balls. Her lone strikeout came against Swarthmore's No. 3 hitter to end the game.




Swarthmore tied the score in the top of the fifth, but Muhlenberg took advantage of back-to-back errors to go back in from in the bottom of the innings. Freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski then hit a two-run double to the leftfield corner, opening the floodgates for the Mule offense.

The next inning, Muhlenberg blew the game open by scoring four runs on five hits – four of them doubles, all coming in a span of five batters. Kline had the biggest two-bagger, knocking in two with a drive to the gap in right-center.

After giving up a run and a double in the first inning, Jones settled down and allowed only one unearned run and three hits the rest of the way. She struck out five in improving to 7-1 on the season.

Muhlenberg fell behind 1-0 in the second game too, but the deficit only lasted until the Mules’ third batter of the game. After one of three walks drawn by junior Chelsea Benjamin, Kline lifted a towering home run over the fence in left to put Muhlenberg on top, 2-1.

The Mules added three runs in the third, knocking out a Garnet pitcher who came in with the second-lowest ERA (1.50) in the CC. Wenzel and freshman Taylor Trifiolis delivered RBI singles in the inning.

Trifiolis, who had three hits in the game, also had an RBI single in the two-run fifth, and Kline brought in a run with a sacrifice fly in the two-run sixth. Her fifth RBI of the doubleheader gave her an even 100 for her career, extending the school record she set on Sunday.

Senior Devon Barber went 4-for-6 in the doubleheader and almost got to the century mark herself. She scored two runs in the first game, increasing her career total to 99.

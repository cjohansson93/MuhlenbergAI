Hours | Locations | Airport Service | Contact




Funded by the Dean of Students Office, the Student Shuttle Service offers students transportation to various locales around the Allentown area.
All students can ride the Shuttle free of charge with presentation of their Muhlenberg ID card.
The Shuttle departs/returns in front of the Center for the Arts following a set schedule. Carefully review the schedule, as the Shuttle will follow a prescribed route and will not deviate from its scheduled stops.  No exceptions will be made.  If the Shuttle Service has to cancel service for any reason (i.e. inclement weather), information can be obtained by calling the Student Information Desk at extension 3493 or Shuttle Steve at extension 610-442-0906.  Enjoy the ride!

 Airport and Bus Station Service Before/After Breaks 
The Shuttle also serves as a means for getting to and from the Lehigh Valley Airport and local bus stations during breaks only: Fall Break, Thanksgiving Recess, Winter Break, Spring Break, Easter Recess, and at the end of the school year.  Please contact Shuttle Steve at 610-442-0906 to coordinate your ride.
The Muhlenberg Shuttle does not, cannot, and will not provide transportation to these locations outside of breaks; no exceptions will be made! Therefore, students must make their own arrangements (i.e. local taxi service or a friend).
Contact Information
 If you have any questions, please e-mail Steve Goosley, Transportation/Shuttle Coordinator at stephengoosley@muhlenberg.edu or call 610-442-0906.

men’s lacrosse rolls past greyhounds


With a de facto playoff game against Ursinus coming up on Saturday, the objectives for the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team against a struggling Moravian squad 



Lolley scored his three goals on five shots and leads the Mules with a .452 shooting percentage.



were to stay sharp in a game setting, give the younger players some time, avoid major injuries and send the seniors out with a win in their last home game.

The Mules were successful on all counts, defeating the Greyhounds, 17-6, to extend their school records for longest winning streak
 (seven) and most victories in a season (nine).

In this year of records, Muhlenberg broke another one, as its 10 assists vs. Moravian raised its season total to 68, eclipsing the mark of 65 set three years ago. The 10 assists were one shy of the school record for a game.

The victory also brought to a close the Matte Award competition for the 2007-08 year, and for the first time since 2000-01 the standings ended in a tie.

The Mules (9-4) dominated the Greyhounds (4-11) in all statistical categories, enjoying margins of 53-22 in shots, 46-34 in ground balls and 18-9 in faceoffs won.

The local rivals were tied 2-2 late in the first quarter before sophomore Al Carpetto and junior Nick Fletcher scored goals 24 seconds apart to give Muhlenberg the lead for good with 2:04 on the clock. Carpetto’s goal was the first of his career.

Senior Kyle Farris scored with 59 seconds left in the first, but Moravian netted the first two goals of the second quarter to make the score 5-4. The Mules proceeded to reel off the next 11 goals, keeping the Hounds off the board for more than 27 minutes.

Freshman Brent Siebold tied a career high with four goals, and junior Andrew Lolley established a new career high in points with three goals and two assists. Sophomore Paul Munday added three assists.

Sophomore Matthew Schroeder led the defense with six ground balls, four in the first quarter alone, and junior John DeLuca scored a goal for the third time in four games.

Junior Dan Dugan won eight of 10 faceoffs and scored his first career goal.

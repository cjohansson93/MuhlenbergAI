Track Teams Make First of Two Trips to Haverford




Ten days before going to Haverford for the Centennial Conference Championships, the Muhlenberg track and field teams traveled to the Main Line for a rare midweek meet.

The Haverford Quad took on greater importance for the Mules when their trip to East Stroudsburg was cancelled on February 5 and some of their athletes
lost an opportunity to post CC-qualifying marks.

 Sophomore Isaiah Vaughn ran the 200 meters twice in finished first both times. He won the open 200 in a personal-best 23.40 and teamed up with junior Peter Rice, freshman Darnell Davis and senior Derek Yates for a win by nearly two seconds in the 4x200 relay.

Senior Seth Hershman (above) won the shot put.

A pair of freshmen won events for the women, Stephanie Carnevale in the 55 meters and Erin Saucier in the pole vault.

The Mules return to the Armory on Saturday for their final tuneup for the CC Championships.

After colliding with a Haverford player with 2.1 seconds left in the first half, freshman Kevin Hargrove remained on the floor for a few minutes before

walking woozily back to the bench. For much of the second half, he sat on the bench with his head wrapped and an icepack on his head.

That's the way it went for the Muhlenberg men's basketball team, which came out fighting but did not have enough at the end and lost to Haverford, 84-72, in a key Centennial Conference game.

It wasn't a knockout, though. The Mules (12-12, 8-9) slipped into sixth place in the CC, one game behind both Haverford and Ursinus. If Muhlenberg beats Ursinus in Saturday's regular-season finale, and Haverford loses to rival Swarthmore, the Mules will make the playoffs as the fifth seed.

The Mules answered the opening bell by making five of their first seven shots to open up a 13-5 lead. But the Fords (12-11, 9-8) shot 63 percent in the first half and opened up a 41-32 lead at the break.

With Hargrove and a couple of other regulars injured and leading scorer Spencer Liddic in foul trouble, Muhlenberg played long stretches of the second half with four freshmen on the floor. The Mules closed to within two points with 11 minutes to play, but Haverford pulled away to win by12.

Liddic finished with 16 points, and Hargrove, who returned with about seven minutes left in the second half, added 13 points, 6 rebounds and a pair of blocked shots. Freshman Austin Curry (15) and senior Evan Tozer (11) also scored in double figures.

field hockey sets up first-place showdown




Women’s Soccer, Volleyball Fall to Garnet


Women’s Soccer


No. 24 Swarthmore scored with 4:24 left in the first overtime to defeat the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team, 2-1. 

Freshman Valerie Patriarca scored on a penalty kick at the 58:21 mark to put the Mules (6-3-3, 3-1-1) in front. 
The goal was just the third allowed this season by Swarthmore. Patriarca won the penalty by beating the Garnet offside trap and rounding the 
goalkeeper 25 yards from the net before she was taken down in the box by the last defender. 

Swarthmore added an extra forward to its formation in search of an equalizer and tied the game on a strong header from six yards out that went in despite 
Mule goalie Kate Morrissey getting a hand on the shot. 

The Garnet won two corner kicks early in the overtime and scored the winning goal off of a deflected shot that resulted from the second corner.

Volleyball


In its last match before heading to California for Fall Break, the Muhlenberg volleyball team was defeated by Swarthmore in four games.

Down 2-0, the Mules (9-14, 1-5) pulled out the third game, 32-30, but lost a close fourth game, 30-28.

Senior 
Jess Anselmi led the attack with
20 kills. Sophomore Brittany Williams recorded a career-high 21 digs.

Michelle Consiglio had been little more than a spectator for the last few Muhlenberg field hockey games. The junior goalie faced only eight shots in comfortable wins against Dickinson, Bryn Mawr and McDaniel, but when called on to preserve a tight game against Swarthmore, she came through.

Consiglio made two big saves in the last four minutes as the Mules (10-3, 6-0) held off Swarthmore, 2-1, to remain in a tie for first in the Centennial Conference with seventh-ranked Johns Hopkins, a 2-0 winner against Franklin & Marshall. The two co-leaders square off in Baltimore Saturday evening.

Sophomore Kristen Sabia gave Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead with 10:43 left in the first half when she converted a pass off a rebound from classmate Nicki Notarianni. But the Garnet (5-8, 2-4) seemed to catch the Mules off-guard in the closing seconds of the first half, tying the game on a long shot and deflection with 16.4 ticks on the clock.

Suddenly, Muhlenberg, which had won its last four games by a combined 20-2, had to fight for a win.

“This was a big help, especially with Hopkins coming up,” said Consiglio. “It will help us keep our heads on straight.”

Notarianni scored the game-winning goal with 6:28 left when she picked up a loose ball in the circle, dribbled in and fired a shot past the goalie for her team-leading 10th goal of the season.

Swarthmore came right back and threatened to re-tie the game off a penalty corner, but Consiglio foiled a tipin at the left post. Then with 28 seconds left, she saved a shot at close range, clinching the Mules’ ninth consecutive CC regular-season win.

The victory put Muhlenberg into double digits for the 12th time in program history. Since 1990, when the Mules won their first 14 games, the only team to get to 10 wins faster was the 2003 squad (12 games).

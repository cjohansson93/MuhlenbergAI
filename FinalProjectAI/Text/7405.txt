Women's Lacrosse Falls at Montclair State
 Friday, March 7, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team ran into a strong Montclair State squad and dropped a 17-10 decision in its first road game of the season.

The Mules (2-1) held a 35-26 advantage in shots, but the Red Hawks found the net on nearly two-thirds of their attempts in remaining perfect at 4-0. Muhlenberg’s first setback of the new campaign snapped a five-game winning streak dating back to last season.

Freshman Nora Fisher recorded her first career hat trick, adding a team-high four draw controls. Junior Stephanie Umbach netted three goals for her second consecutive hat trick and the 18th of her career, while senior Michelle Certosimo handed out all five of the Mules’ assists to move to within five of tying the school’s all-time record.

Sophomore Amanda Orlak led the way on defense with career highs of five ground balls and four caused turnovers. 

Muhlenberg got off to a flying start, as senior Ally Shaffer scored on a feed from Certosimo (right) less than a minute and a half into the game. Montclair State, an NCAA Tournament participant each of the last four seasons, equalized quickly, but Umbach put Muhlenberg back on top 30 seconds later. 

With the teams knotted at 3-all, the Red Hawks ran off the next five goals. The Mules, however, ended the half on a 3-0 run, with sophomore Casey Armstrong, senior Kayleigh Thies (two goals) and Fisher scoring to pull within 8-6 at intermission. But Montclair State scored the first four goals after halftime to stifle any hope of a comeback.

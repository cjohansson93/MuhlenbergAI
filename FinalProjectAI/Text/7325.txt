Women's Basketball Falls at Moravian 
 Tuesday, December 3, 2013 - page 2







					 






Tallamy showed off her point guard skills with this steal (one of three she had in the game) and fullcourt layup that gave the Mules a 16-10 lead
midway through the first half.



Three-point shooting was the difference as the Moravian  women’s basketball team outlasted Muhlenberg, 73-68, in a tense, hard-fought game
between local rivals.

Led by junior Leanna Tallamy, who scored a career-high 29 points, the Mules (4-2) made more field goals. But the Greyhounds (5-1)
connected on nine three-pointers to none for the Mules and were 5-of-9 from behind the arc in the second half.

Neither team led by more than eight points, and there were seven ties and 10 lead changes in the back-and-forth game. Muhlenberg took its
 last lead with a 6-0 run consisting of back-to-back layups by senior Colleen Caldwell and a pair of Tallamy free throws to go
up 54-51 with under nine minutes to play.

Moravian, whose only loss is to nationally ranked Trinity (Texas), responded by scoring the next seven points, capped by a three, and eventually 
pushed its edge to eight points at the four-minute mark.

The Mules got to within three on a jumper by senior Erin Laney with 1:28 to play, but the Greyhounds nailed a three-pointer on 
the next possession to double the lead. Muhlenberg again cut the margin to three, at 71-68, with 29.5 seconds left before Moravian hit two free throws for the
final points of the game.

Tallamy added 13 rebounds (eight offensive) to her 29 points, and Laney also had a double-double – the second of her career – with 14 points and 10 rebounds.
The Mules got 16 points from their point guards, with Caldwell and junior Janelle Fleet scoring eight apiece. Sophomore
Christina Santone blocked five shots and played excellent defense on the Greyhounds’ top scorer, who needed 18 shots to 
score 18 points and also committed 10 turnovers.

The win gave Moravian a 6-5 lead in the 2013-14 Matte Award standings.

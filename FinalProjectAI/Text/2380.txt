Isabel A. Wilkerson’s book The Warmth of Other Suns, a national and New York Times best-seller, tells the epic story of the Great Migration, a watershed in American history. She has devoted her life’s work to the nonfiction of empathy, exploring the universal themes of social justice and common humanity through the lives of ordinary people with stories that both teach and touch the hearts of her readers.            The Warmth of Other Suns won numerous honors, including the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction, the 2011 Anisfield-Wolf Award for Nonfiction, the 2011 Lynton History Prize from Harvard and Columbia universities, the 2011 Heartland Prize for Nonfiction, the 2012 Stephen Ambrose Oral History Prize, the 2011 Hillman Book Prize, the 2011 Independent Literary Award, the 2011 New England Book Award, the 2011 Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction, the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Debut and was a finalist for the Pen-Galbraith Literary Award for Nonfiction and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize. 
The book was named to more than 30 Best of the Year lists, including The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Economist, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today and The Washington Post. In 2011, it made news around the world when the White House announced that President Barack Obama chose The Warmth of Other Suns for summer reading, along with "Cutting for Stone" by Abraham Verghese and "To the End of the Land" by David Grossman.

Wilkerson also won a George Polk Award, a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship for her research into the Great Migration, and she was named Journalist of the Year by the National Association of Black Journalists.      She has appeared on national programs such as Fresh Air with Terry Gross, The Charlie Rose Show, The PBS News Hour," CBS’s 60 Minutes, NBC’s Nightly News, on MSNBC and the BBC, and has lectured at universities throughout the country and in Europe on the theme of migration, identity and 20th Century history. She has lectured on narrative writing at the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University and has served as Kreeger-Wolf Endowed Lecturer at Northwestern University, as Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University, the James M.

Martin has re-established its reputation worldwide as the builder of the highest quality guitars.  Eric Clapton and Paul Simon are among the artists who have chosen to be involved in designing new limited edition guitars, and Martin once again makes more acoustic guitars than any other company in the U.

Christopher Albert "Chris" Sims is an econometrician and macroeconomist. He is currently the Harold B. Helms Professor of Economics and Banking at Princeton University. Sims earned his Ph.D. in Economics in 1968 at Harvard University. He held teaching positions at Harvard, University of Minnesota, Yale University and, since 1999, Princeton. Sims is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (since 1989) and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1988). In 1995 he was the president of the Econometric Society. Sims published numerous important papers in his areas of research: econometrics and macroeconomic theory and policy. Among other things, he was one of the main promoters of the use of Vector autoregression in empirical macroeconomics. He has also helped develop the fiscal theory of the price level.
On October 10, 2011, Christopher A. Sims together with Thomas J. Sargent was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The award cited their "empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy". His Nobel lecture, titled "Statistical Modeling of Monetary Policy and its Effects" was delivered on December 8, 2011.
Translating his work into everyday language, Sims said it provided a technique to assess the direction of causality in central bank monetary policy. It confirmed the theories of monetarists like Milton Friedman that shifts in the money supply affect inflation. However, it also showed that causality went both ways. Variables like interest rates and inflation also led to changes in the money supply.

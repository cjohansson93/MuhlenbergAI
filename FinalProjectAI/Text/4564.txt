Women’s Teams Swept at Dickinson


The Muhlenberg women's soccer team lost only two games to Centennial Conference teams last year, both to Dickinson, 4-1 in the regular season and 4-2 in the CC playoffs. Although the Mules
fell to the Red Devils again this season, this time the score was much closer.

Dickinson scored off a rebound 1:19 into the second overtime to hand Muhlenberg (2-5-2, 2-1) its first CC loss of the season. The Mules entered the day as the lone undefeated team in the CC.

Junior Michele Toher made eight saves to keep the Devils off the board until the end.

The Muhlenberg men's soccer team came oh-so-close to its first win against Johns Hopkins at Homewood Field.

In the 58th minute, Matt Cecconi got his head on a corner kick and flicked it toward the Johns Hopkins net. The ball hit the bottom of the crossbar and bounced straight down before it was cleared out by a Blue Jay defender.

Cecconis header helped awaken Muhlenbergs offense, but the Mules would not get any closer than the header off the crossbar as they tied Johns Hopkins, 0-0.

It was the second straight scoreless tie between the two nationally ranked Centennial Conference rivals at Homewood Field, where Muhlenberg (5-0-4, 1-0-3) is 0-8-3 against
Hopkins since the start of CC play in 1993.

The Blue Jays (7-2-3, 1-1-2) almost scored in the 31st minute when Mule goalkeeper Jason Daniels was caught out of the net, 
but Kyle Plifka stepped in front of the empty net and cleared a shot away.

The two teams traded several scoring chances, but could not find the winner.  
The Blue Jays held a 29-14 advantage in shots. Daniels made 10 saves for the Mules, including one on a breakaway late in the second half.

Muhlenbergs four ties on the season are the most since 2006 and tied for the second-most in school history. The Mules also remain unbeaten through nine games, the longest streak to start a season since 1995.

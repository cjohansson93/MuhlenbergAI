Men's soccer bounces back, clinches third seed





Leischner's first-half assist was his team-leading fifth of the season.



Instead of letting the Muhlenberg men's soccer team's first loss of the season get to his head, Kyle Plifka used his noggin to help the Mules regroup quickly and return to their winning ways Saturday afternoon.

The sophomore back headed home a Tim Leischner corner kick in the fourth minute as the Mules cruised to a 3-0 win in their regular-season finale at Ursinus.

Muhlenberg did not allow a Bear shot in the first 45 minutes, and led 1-0 at halftime.

After the break, the Mules got a pair of goals less than seven minutes apart from Josh Luginbuhl and Danny Way to put Ursinus (2-14-1, 0-9) away.

Luginbuhl struck first in the 66th minute when he tracked down his own rebound and scored on an open net.  Then Way took a pass from Mike Williams and buried it inside the near post for the final tally.

Muhlenberg held a 19-4 advantage in shots, and goalie Jason Daniels only had to make one save.

With the win, the Mules (10-1-6, 5-1-3) clinched the third seed for next week's Centennial Conference tournament at Swarthmore. Muhlenberg will face second-seeded Franklin & Marshall in the semifinals. The two teams battled to a 1-1 tie in Allentown during the regular season.

The Mules also tied the school record for fewest losses in a regular season. It is eighth time Muhlenberg has navigated the regular season with one loss, and first since the 1994 and 1995 squads did so in back-to-back years.

For Maereg Gebretekle, âA Feeling of, Feeling Forâ was more than just a theater production; it was an opportunity for contemplation.
âWithin daily life we never have the chance to reflect on these big questions,â they said. âHow do we withdraw from intellectualizing our way out of trauma and towards inserting ourselves back into our bodies? How can we mourn the person who we couldâve become but no longer desire to be?â
Gebretekle, a Muhlenberg College senior who alternates between âsheâ and âtheyâ pronouns, has found in her rehearsal process that these questions may not have an answer â but that in asking them, she and her group of actors have found an outlet for reflection.
âA Feeling of, Feeling forâ will run March 25-27 in Muhlenbergâs Studio Theatre. It is one of five projects within a semester-long âAssembly Festival,â running through May. Information on all five projects is available at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow.
âThe intellectual part of us wants to think through and discuss traumatic experiences,â Gebretekle said. âBut loss is also held in the body. I want the ensemble to generate stories and dances of their own loss that they can expel through action.â
Gebretekle originated the project, leading a group of seven performers through an explorative production process. She was assistant director for the 2020 production of âRaisin in the Sun,â directed by Jeffrey Page. They were also president of the Muhlenberg Theatre Association in 2021.
âA Feeling of, Feeling Forâ was first inspired by Omiseâeke Natasha Tinsleyâs 2008 article âBlack Atlantic, Queer Atlantic.â It has since evolved into an exploration of loss that is specific to each participating ensemble member. Gebretekle sought out a group of seven BIPOC actors who were brave enough to share their own stories of loss. The ensemble have been sculpting their narratives, using ritual as a conduit for storytelling.
âI wanted to create this piece with people who were willing to bring their personal losses and burdens to the space,â she said, âto let other ensemble members as well as the audience members take care of them. Itâs an emotionally demanding task, but everyone has been really generous with what they are willing to share.â
As the ensemble prepares to share their work with the Muhlenberg community, Gebretekle asks that the audience be mindful of how they bear witness to the ensemble's stories.
âItâs great to talk about a performance and explore the different discourses around it,â she said, âbut I want to emphasize that this piece was conceived and rehearsed with the actors being prioritized, rather than the audience. I wanted this project to center BIPOC stories. This is for them and that has been my main goal while working on the production.â
âA Feeling of, Feeling Forâ premieres March 25-27, in the Studio Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance, Muhlenberg College. Showtimes are March 25-27: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., and Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. All tickets are $5. Tickets and information are available at 484-664-3333 or online.

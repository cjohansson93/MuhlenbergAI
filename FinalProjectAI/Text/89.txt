The Mutual Aid Project
What began as a musical theatre project about the philosophical concept of Mutual Aid has since transformed into a collective, engaged in the actual practice of mutual aid, which they envision as a decentralized collective process â open to any members of the Muhlenberg community.
The collective will hold seven meetings over the course of the semester, open to anyone in the Muhlenberg community. In these meetings, the collective will explore ways to creatively plan a series of mutual aid initiatives and stagings together, perhaps through a series of social sculptures and other artistic practices. Everyone is welcome.
Faculty Advisor: Ethan Philbrick

Meeting Dates: 
Every other Wednesday, 7 to 9 pmroom CA 166, Baker Center for the ArtsAll are welcome!

Winter Breaks Records as Football Wins Fourth Straight

The cold, windy conditions and the end of Daylight Savings Time were two sure signs that winter isn’t too far behind.
And when it comes to the Muhlenberg football record book, Winter isn’t behind at all.

Senior Connor Winter broke two school records for kickers as the Mules won their fourth straight game, 34-20 on a blustery day at Dickinson.

Winter kicked field goals of 30 and 26 yards, breaking the school record of 27 career field goals that was set 24 years ago and tied but not matched since. He also booted four extra points, 
bringing his career point total to 207 – a school record for a kicker.

Winter’s record day headed other noteworthy performances by Mules. Sophomore Nick Palladino recorded his second straight 300-yard game and accounted for four touchdowns, 
freshman Max Cepeda rushed for over 100 yards, and senior Cody Geyer amassed 248 all-purpose yards.

Palladino completed 27 of 37 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns while also running for a score. Coming on the heels of his career-best 373-yard effort against Juniata last week, 
it made him only the second quarterback in team history with back-to-back 300-yard games. Palladino also went over 4,000 passing yards for his career in just his 19th game.


Cepeda carried 22 times for 104 yards to break the Centennial Conference record for 100-yard games by a freshman (six), which he tied last week. Geyer caught nine passes for 161 yards and a 
touchdown in addition to rushing for 25 yards and returning kicks for 62.

Defensively, the Mules (7-1, 6-1) held Dickinson to 81 rushing yards and limited the CC’s leading rusher to 32, more than 70 below his average. The Red Devils (3-5, 3-4) had minus-2 rushing 
yards in the first half.

Muhlenberg scored points on six of its first seven possessions. Geyer’s 20-yard punt return to the Dickinson 43 set up the Mules with a short field on their first possession, 
and they needed only six plays to get into the end zone, with Palladino running it in himself from 12 yards out.

Palladino hit senior Michael Long (8 catches, 76 yards) for a 6-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter, and Winter’s ensuing kickoff was muffed. 
Junior Alex Meller recovered the fumble at the Dickinson 33, and Winter kicked his first field goal six plays later.

After the Red Devils got on the board with the first of their three touchdown passes, Muhlenberg answered right back on Geyer’s 22-yard catch-and-run for a score with 21.4 seconds left 
in the half.

Palladino’s 26-yard touchdown pass to Long (left) capped the first drive of the second half and made it 31-7.

Senior Ian Gimbar led the defense with eight tackles. Seniors Greg DeLade (right) and Jeremey Thomas each had two tackles for loss,
including a sack.

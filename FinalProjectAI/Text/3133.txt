Two Win Wrestling Titles


Muhlenberg wrestling seniors Rob Kein and Matt Horn took different routes, but both came away with titles at the Washington and Lee Invitational. 

Kein pinned his first opponent at 149, then won a pair of close decisions (2-1 and 3-1) to capture his second tournament championship of the season.

Horn remained undefeated (9-0) at 184 pounds this year by winning three bouts, two with pins and the other with a 7-0 decision. Horn, who has placed in the top three in all four tournaments this year, now has 30 career pins.

Two other Mules won places. Freshman Nick Pallotta was third at heavyweight, scoring all three of his wins by fall. Sophomore Bill Sholly came in fourth at 197.

The Mules finished fifth in the team standings.

good mix of the old and the new at Susquehanna’s Orange & Maroon Classic.

All in all, The Mules produced four first-place finishes, three ECAC qualifiers and one NCAA provisional qualifier.

First the “old.” Junior Alex Faust provisionally qualified for the NCAA Championships in the pole vault, won the 400 meters in a personal-best, ECAC-qualifying time, and ran on the 4x400 relay team that came in first.

Junior Brendan Kirk finished in the top six in four events: first in the 4x400, second in the 55 hurdles, fourth in the 400 and sixth in 4x200. 
His teammates on the 4x400 included senior Stuart Udis and sophomore Bobby Torphy, who finished 3-4 in the 800.

Senior David Chorney placed second in the mile with an ECAC-qualifying time.

And the new? Junior Jennifer Lynch, running track for the first time, came in second in the mile and anchored the distance-medley relay team that finished first in ECAC-qualifying time. Freshman Kimberlee Yalango ran on both first-place relay teams, and classmate Jenna Schaffer placed fourth in the 55 meters in addition to contributing to the 4x400 victory.

For the men, freshman Joe Tritto was second in the shot put. His throw of 44-10¾ ranks sixth on Muhlenberg’s performance list and is believed to be the best throw by a freshman in his first meet in program history. Freshman Marc Brookland took a double jump from seventh to fifth on the performance list with his triple jump of 42-5½.

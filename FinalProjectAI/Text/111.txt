Guide to the New Curriculum
Starting with the Class of 2024, the curriculum for the Theatre major has been overhauled to allow our students greater flexibility and greater breadth in their studies. It is just as possible as ever for theatre students to focus their studies in one particular area, and we will continue to offer just as many courses in every discipline as we have in the past â more, in many cases. Students who would prefer to design a multifocus, multifaceted curriculum will find it easier than in the past.
This guide to the new curriculum offers an overview of the courses you can expect to take each year of the theatre major. It also offers several possible paths through the major, for students with various interests. You can follow one of these paths, or create a path of your own. The choice is yours!
You may find that one of these paths is quite similar to the one thatâs right for you. You may start out on a path similar to one of these, and then find that your interests have changed or broadened. You may already know that none of these paths is exactly the one for you. All of this is all right! Donât worry: your major academic advisor will be a theatre professor, and theyâll be there to help you figure it all out!

six men’s soccer players earn cc honors




Six members of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team were voted to the All-Centennial Conference team. 

The six selections are the most for the Mules since the 2003 squad had seven players honored, and the three first-team selections (seniors Billy Dalton,
A.J. Barnold and Joseph Gogel tied the program high (since joining the CC) achieved previously in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2003 and 2005.
 
Dalton (near left) received All-CC honors for the third time in his career. He was a second-team pick in 2006 and earned honorable mention last year. Dalton led Muhlenberg in scoring
with 18 points on seven goals and four assists and finished his career with 42 point.


Barnold (right) made the All-CC squad for the first time. A starter at 
center back for a defense that allowed only 15 goals in 19 games, Barnold’s 6-5 size helped him
win many head balls, and his long legs made it hard for opponents to dribble by him.

After waiting three years for his chance to start, Gogel (top left) made the most of it. He played all but 41 minutes in goal for the season, ranking second in the CC in 
both goals-against average (0.75) and save percentage (.808). Gogel leads the conference with eight shutouts.

Senior midfielder Greg Leischner, sophomore forward Tom Reilly and freshman midfielder Cody Antonini all received honorable mention. Leischner,
who made honorable mention for the second straight year, scored a career-high nine points. Reilly, in his first year with the Mules, finished second on the team with 15 points,
and Antonini, the first Mule freshman to earn CC honors since 2000, scored 13 points, including a team-leading nine in CC games.

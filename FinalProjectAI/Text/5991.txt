Men's Tennis Experiences Success at ITAs; Men's Golf Threesome Solid
 Monday, October 3, 2011







					 



The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team enjoyed a successful, though wet at times, weekend at the ITA Southeast Regional, hosted by Mary Washington.

Of the eight Mules who competed, six won at least one match, and the other two had their doubles consolation matches cancelled because of the rain.

Freshmen Daniel Lakhman and Eric Chavis each won two matches in singles play and one together as a doubles team.
In the B1 singles draw, Lakhman reached the consolation final before falling in a close 8-6 match. Chavis, playing in the B5 singles draw, won his
first two matches, including a 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) marathon, before losing the semifinals.

In B2 doubles, Lakhman and Chavis played two matches that went to tiebreakers, winning 9-8 (7-4) in the first and dropping a 7-6 (7-0) decision in the second.

Sophomore Ben Berkowitz (right) reached the consolation final at B4 singles, but he too lost in a tiebreaker, 9-8 (7-4).

The doubles team of senior Robert Buesser and freshman Corey Galembo advanced to the B3 semifinals.

Men’s Golf

The Muhlenberg men’s golf team sent three players to the Penn State Harrisburg Invitational over the weekend. Although the Mules were one player
short of recording a team score, the three players fared very well, all shooting in the 70s in both rounds.

Senior Zack Meyers tied for fifth place, missing out on all-tournament honors on a tiebreaker, with a 74-75--149. The first-round 74 was
a career best for Meyers. Sophomore Christopher Lucarelli tied for eighth with a 77-74--151, and sophomore Chris DiMaio
was two strokes behind at 75-78--153.

The School of Graduate Studies offers programs with multiple pathways that allow adult learners the flexibility needed to succeed. Our graduate programs are taught in a hybrid format that combines meaningful on-campus learning experiences with distance learning strategies.
In keeping with the Muhlenberg College mission, graduate education continues the goal of developing each individualâs capacity for a life of leadership and service by challenging and strengthening mind, spirit, character, and community while preparing the student for professional growth.

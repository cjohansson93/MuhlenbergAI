Admission Requirements
As we assess your application, weâll review your scholastic performance and weâll look at your personal interests and activities. There is no precise admissions "formula;" we look at a range of factors. The following credentials are of primary importance:
Secondary school record
You should be on track to complete a secondary school college preparatory program of at least 16 Carnegie units. These units should include four of English, two (preferably three) of one foreign language, three of mathematics, two (preferably three) of science, two of history and major academic electives. Exceptions to these requirements will be considered on an individual basis in cases of documented learning disability, home schooling or other exceptional situations.
We recognize and encourage secondary school enrollment in accelerated and advanced placement courses.
Standardized tests
Muhlenberg has been test optional for admissions since 1996. There are no additional application requirements for a test optional applicant to complete their application. Please indicate your preferred testing preference on the Muhlenberg specific questions on the Common Application. If you would like to change your testing preference after you submit your Common Application, please complete and submit a Test-Optional Form to admissions@muhlenberg.edu. Test optional applicants will be considered for merit scholarships and honors programs.
While test scores are optional for admissions, students must submit test scores to be considered for the Academic Partnerships (University of Pennsylvania Dental Medicine 3-4 Biodental Program and SUNY College of Optometry 3-4 Combined Program).
Personal qualities
While the strength of an applicant's academic preparation is of primary consideration, the Admission Committee is also very interested in each applicant as an individual. Evidence of an applicant's personal qualities is considered through the breadth and depth of extracurricular pursuits, the personal essay and the recommendations from the student's school advisor and two teachers of major academic classes. A personal interview with a member of the Admission staff is also helpful in this regard.

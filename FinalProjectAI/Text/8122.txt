Mission Statement
The Institute for Religious and Cultural Understanding works to cultivate awareness of religious and cultural diversity locally, domestically, and internationally. The educational and research goals of the Institute serve two complementary objectives: to enhance religious and cultural literacy and to support reasoned analysis of religion in public discourse. The Institute reaches beyond the borders of campus to effect change in the local community and beyond through the cultivation of both a physical and virtual presence.

Institute Team
Director
William âChipâ Gruen, Ph.D.
Email
William âChipâ Gruen, Ph.D. is professor of religion studies and the director of the Institute for Religious and Cultural Understanding. He has been the chair of the Department of Religion Studies for 8 years and also directs the faculty Humanities Seminar at Muhlenberg. He joined the campus community in 2006 after completing his doctoral degree at the University of Pennsylvania. He has also matriculated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Kentucky.
Dr. Gruen has published in a wide variety of highly respected outlets, including the Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha, Early Christianity, and Inside Higher Education. His current research considers how marginal religious groups are (mis)remembered and (mis)interpreted in source texts from antiquity. He is particularly concerned with the preservation and destruction of both textual traditions and objects of material culture and how the resulting incomplete record colors our view of the past.
More broadly, his interests include religions of the ancient Mediterranean, including Christianity, Judaism, and traditional religions of the Roman Empire. Additionally, both his teaching repertoire and publication record include theory and method in the study of religion and the discourses surrounding religion in the contemporary world.
His courses at Muhlenberg College cover the emergence and history of Christianity from its Jewish roots to the present. He also teaches theoretical and comparative courses that challenge students to consider religious belief and practice from new and inventive perspectives.
From the very particular to the highly theoretical, these topics inform a broad repertoire of presentation topics suitable for a wide variety of audiences.

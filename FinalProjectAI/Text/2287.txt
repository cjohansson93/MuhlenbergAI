A member of the Muhlenberg College history department since 1986, Tighe specializes in the political, religious and social history of Tudor and Stuart Britain (c. 1460 to c. 1715). His Ph.D. work focused on a corps of men known as the Gentlemen Pensioners at the court of Queen Elizabeth I and over the past decade he has embarked on a wide-ranging study of that group of the most intimate servants of that queen known collectively as the Privy Chamber.
His teaching interests include the whole of British history, Europe in the Renaissance, the Reformation and the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and a range of introductory courses, first-year seminars and other departmental offerings.
A graduate of Georgetown University with a B.A. in history summa cum laude, Tighe earned his M.A. and M. Phil. from Yale University and his Ph.D. from Cambridge University, after which he was a university research fellow in history at the University College of North Wales.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education and public health. A member of the Centennial Conference, Muhlenberg competes in 22 varsity sports. Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

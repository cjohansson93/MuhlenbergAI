Liddic Selected Co-Player of the Week 





Sophomore Spencer Liddic was named the Centennial Conference co-player of the week.

Liddic narrowly missed the first 20/20 game by a CC player in two years against Swarthmore, scoring a career-high 24 points and pulling down a career-high 19 rebounds in the Mules’ 64-50 win. He was 10-for-16 from the field and added three assists and two blocked shots.

Liddic entered the week leading the CC in rebounding by a wide margin; his average of 10.5 boards per game was almost two more than the second-place player. He also was seventh in scoring (14.0 points per game), eighth in field-goal percentage (.508) and tied for second in blocked shots (26). In league games, Liddic is averaging 15.3 points and 11.1 rebounds.




The second men’s basketball meeting between Muhlenberg and Franklin & Marshall this season looked like it was about to go the same way as the first.

The Mules suffered their worst loss of the season when they played the Diplomats on January 12, falling 80-58 at home. In the rematch, Muhlenberg went more than five minutes without scoring to fall behind by 11 with six minutes to go in the first half.

But this time the Mules didn’t let the game get out of hand, going on an 11-0 run to tie it back up. Although Muhlenberg never took the lead, it kept the contest close the rest of the game and ended up falling, 69-63.

The Mules (12-9, 10-4), who would have tied the 15th-ranked Diplomats (18-3, 12-2) for first place in the Centennial Conference with a win, instead saw their lead over third-place Ursinus and Gettysburg fall to one game with four left to play.

Muhlenberg was within one point with 12 minutes left in the game. After F&M extended the lead to 10 again, the Mules closed the gap to four points with 4:11 left, but did not make another field goal.

Sophomore Spencer Liddic had a dunk in the game-tying run and finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds for his CC-leading 10th double-double of the season. Senior Ryan Foster had 19 points and eight rebounds, including seven off the offensive glass.

Sophomore Justin Greenstone played a fabulous game at the point, scoring a career-high 10 points and handing out three assists.

A Message to the Muhlenberg Community



A note from President Harring to the Muhlenberg College community


	 Wednesday, March 17, 2021  10:27 AM

To the Muhlenberg Community,
Today we learned of another tragic incident of violence against Asian Americans, with the killing of eight people in Atlanta, six of whom were Asian. It was not even one week ago that Muhlenbergâs Asian Student Association held an event to discuss anti-Asian hate openly, and we are faced yet again with another horrific example that affects us all. To our Asian students, faculty and staff, we join in your grief and stand together at this incredibly difficult time. Today and in the days ahead, we must all do what we can to support one another amidst the brazen racist hate that continues to cast a shadow over our society.
Incidents like this increase our stress and anxiety in unhealthy ways. Please know that Muhlenberg is here for you. The Counseling Center and College Chaplain are available for confidential support and conversation as well. In addition, the Office of Multicultural Life, the Bias Resource & Education Team and the Associate Provost for Faculty and Diversity Initiatives (brookevick@muhlenberg.edu) are helpful community resources you can access. Employees may turn to the Employee Assistance Program as well. Finally, reports of bias incidents that could violate College policies may also be made to Equity & Title IX or online. I encourage you to reach out if you need help.
I want to affirm Muhlenbergâs fundamental values in support of diversity, equity and humanity. We reject all acts of bias and bigotry and will continue to act in ways that support the inherent dignity and worth of all people. Please take care of yourself, and do not hesitate to turn to your Muhlenberg resources for support at this time.
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringPresident

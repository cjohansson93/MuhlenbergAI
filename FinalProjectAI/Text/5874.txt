field hockey gets needed win to stay alive



After suffering back-to-back shutout losses, the Muhlenberg field hockey team regained some momentum heading into its important regular-season finale by defeating Bryn Mawr, 4-0.

The Mules host No. 13 Gettysburg on Friday in a game that is critical to their Centennial Conference playoff hopes. Muhlenberg (9-7, 5-4) is in fifth place, a half-game behind McDaniel (5-3) and a half-game ahead of Haverford (4-4). McDaniel plays at Johns Hopkins (6-2) and Haverford hosts Swarthmore (1-6) on Wednesday, and if the standings hold up the three will go into the final weekend of the season tied. Gettysburg (6-2) is also vying for a playoff spot.

Playing on a soggy field, the Mules outshot the winless Owls 24-8 and had a 16-0 advantage in penalty corners. It was on one of those corners that Muhlenberg broke a scoreless tie with 12:47 left in the first half, with junior Jess Kasza ripping one from the top of the circle for her fifth goal of the season – all in CC games.

The Mules added three goals in the second half, and all involved “firsts.” Sophomore Courtney DeAngelis scored her first goal of the season when she put in a rebound of a shot by freshman Nicole Fiorentino. Freshman Kiara Santana (right) recorded her first career point by assisting on a goal by senior Nicki Notarianni. 

With 1:05 left, Fiorentino netted her first career point, assisting on senior Tara Cohn’s goal.

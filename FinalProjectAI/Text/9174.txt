EnAcTâs efforts resulted in a resolution passed by an overwhelming majority of Student Government.
The resolution excludes bottled water from the student meal plan but allows a person to purchase the water using cash, credit, or dining or flex dollars.
As a result of EnAcTâs efforts, water bottle purchases on campus dropped by 95%. Furthermore, new filtered water stations have been installed all over campus. In support of this initiative, President Helm, in conjunction with other departments funded the purchase of reusable aluminum water bottles for the freshman class

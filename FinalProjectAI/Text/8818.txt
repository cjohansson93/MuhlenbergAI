          Why are my print jobs are not going to my print queue
  








Make sure your credentials are correct. Your username and password are the same as those used for OneLogin. The login box for Papercut may be autopopulating an incorrect username. 
 
 






          What are key features of Papercut?
  









Follow Me Printing - you will be able to access print jobs at any PaperCut enabled copier
Automatic deletion of abandoned job -  Print jobs are automatically deleted if not released after a specified time (72 hours), thus eliminating waste for jobs never picked up or documents that needed to be reprinted due to a mistake.
Secure Printing - All print jobs will be secure so there is no worry of a print job sent to the copier getting into the hands of the wrong person. To release of print, you simply login at the Ricoh with your Muhlenberg ID card. Forget your card? Not a problem. You may enter your credentials manually at the printer.
Sustainability - Print Management Software such as PaperCut enhances the environmental goals of the College. It will help reduce waste, all while adding increased security to your documents.
Convenience - Finally, the ability to pick up your print job at any device will allow everyone to be more productive as a copier waiting for service or with a line of people will not prevent you from picking up your print job.







          My ID card isn't recognized? 

  








If your ID card is not recognized by the Ricoh card reader, you may manually associate your card by entering your network credentials manually once into the device. Once associated your card will work with your account.  In addition, we ask that you report this issue via the IT Support Portal. 






          Do I have to install anything to use Papercut?

  








You can print to Papercut in a variety of ways. Please check out the printing help guides to learn more.






          Can I print from a mobile device? 
  








Mobile printing to PaperCut is available. Documentation is available on the printing help guides webpage.

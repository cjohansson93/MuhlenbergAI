Farris breaks scoring record
in important men’s lax win 


Prior to today’s matchup against Swarthmore, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team had never defeated the Garnet in Allentown.
 
Besides, the Mules hadn’t won a home Centennial Conference game since April 9, 2006.

With their backs against the wall, the Mules not only put an end to their

nightmare home losing streak in the league, but also recorded their biggest margin of victory ever in a CC game.

Thirteen players registered at least a point for Muhlenberg in the 15-5 triumph, which revived their hopes for first-ever CC playoff appearance.

One player had an additional reason to celebrate after the success.

Senior Kyle Farris became the most prolific goal-scorer in school history as he notched a hat trick to raise his total to 78 career goals, thus surpassing Doug Cornwell with 76.

“It’s more important that we got a solid win than my record,” Farris said.

Following the game against Swarthmore, Farris has compiled 95 career points and needs five more to become the fourth Muhlenberg player to hit the century mark.

Classmate Mickey Norton, who conquered the 100-point plateau two weeks ago, finished with three points (one goal and two assists) and came one step closer to becoming the Mules’ all-time leader in points. His current total of 105 is a point of shy of the record of 106 set by Sean Toohill and Glenn Salo.

Despite opening the score in the eighth minute of the first half, the visitors never posed a real threat to Muhlenberg. After quickly equalizing the score thanks to Norton with 7:04 remaining in the first period, the Mules came up top just 30 seconds later following a Mike Brown goal.

Swarthmore tied the score at two early in the second period before Muhlenberg put the game out of reach with six straight goals to open an 8-2 lead. One of those goals was an extra-man score by Farris 18 seconds into the second half, which not only gave him the record but also got the Mules off to a good start in the quarter that was their downfall in losses to Washington and Haverford.

Freshman Brent Siebold and juniors Nick Fletcher and Cade McCarthy finished with two goals apiece for the Mules, who limited their opponents to season-low five goals.
 
Sophomore Sean Delany scored his first career goal for Muhlenberg, when he shaped up the final score, 15-5, with 2:08 left. 

“Our defense stepped up today,” Farris said. “It’s impressive to hold a team of this caliber to only five goals.”

Sophomore Matthew Schroeder contributed team-leading five ground balls, while junior Dan Dugan won 80 percent of his face-offs (8 of 10). 

“We can’t afford any more losses, but we take one game at a time,” Farris said.

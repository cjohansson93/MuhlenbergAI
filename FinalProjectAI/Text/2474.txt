Applying to Public Health Graduate Programs
Not all graduate programs are the same. There are Schools of Public Health (similar to Medical Schools), and there are programs in Public Health. Both of these venues will provide you with the opportunity to pursue a graduate degree (normally the MPHâMasters in Public Health). The Schools of Public Health will also offer terminal degrees; the DrPH (doctorate in Public Health is pursued once you have an MPH) and there are also PhD programs in subspecialties of Public Health, such as Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Environmental Health, and Behavioral and Social Health. Note that some Schools of Public Health, such as Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School, require students to work in an appropriate field for at least two years before they can apply. There are also many schools that offer dual professional degrees such as MD/MPH, PA/MPH and JD/MPH. Many schools are offering an online-based MPH (e.g. Johns Hopkins) where students complete 80% of their course work through on-line course work and 20% during short, intense week-long courses in residence in the summer. This is especially good for working professionals.
Log on to the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) website for a full listing of accredited Schools and programs (www.asph.org).

You will need to take the GREâs before applying. You can apply to most Schools of Public Health simultaneously by using the on-line application process call SOPHAS, however some Schools of PH have their own on-line application.

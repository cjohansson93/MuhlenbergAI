Johns Hopkins Runs Away from Football Team
 Saturday, September 28, 2013 - page 3







					 



 

For most of the first half, the Muhlenberg football team went toe-to-toe with defending Centennial Conference champion Johns Hopkins. But the 13th-ranked Blue Jays
ran away in the second half, ending the game by scoring 31 unanswered points en route to a 45-13 win. 

For the second game in a row, the Mules (2-2, 1-2) forced a turnover on the first play from scrimmage, as junior Kevin Cellary recovered a fumble.
That did not lead directly to any points, but Muhlenberg did grab a 3-0 lead later in the quarter on a 27-yard field goal by junior Connor Winter.
A 52-yard pass from freshman Nick Palladino to junior Cody Geyer set up the three-pointer.

Winter later added a career-best 44-yarder, but Hopkins (4-0, 3-0) led 14-6 before Palladino hit sophomore Mike Harris (left) with
a 17-yard touchdown pass with 2:38 left in the half to cut the margin to one point.



Field Hockey Shut Out at Dickinson


The Muhlenberg field hockey team fell to 0-4 on its five-game road stretch with a 2-0 Centennial Conference loss at Dickinson. The Red Devils scored early in 
each half.

The shutout loss was the first for the Mules (2-6, 1-2) in 13 games, dating back to last year.

The Blue Jays were faced with a third-and-18 near midfield on the ensuing drive but converted with a 21-yard pass play. On the next play, a 23-yard pass into the
end zone gave Hopkins a 21-13 lead with 22.3 seconds on the clock.

Hopkins outscored Muhlenberg 24-0 in the second half.

Harris caught five passes for 96 yards (both career highs) for the Mules, while Palladino passed for 211 yards. 
Junior Gene Blanco led the defense with 17 tackles, including 2½ for loss. Senior Kory Crichton (14) and junior Chris Flynn
(12) also reached double figures in tackles for a defense that was on the field for 88 plays.

boyle, bernardini named to all-star teams



As the basketball season winds down, time for recognizing the individual accomplishments comes into the limelight. And Muhlenberg certainly has players of which to be proud.

Mule juniors Lauren Boyle and Mike Bernardini were named to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Teams of the Year. 
The honorees were announced at the Lehigh Valley College Basketball Media Organization’s final luncheon of the season, at Starter’s Pub in Bethlehem. 

Less than a week after Boyle was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division team, she claimed another prestigious award.

“It means a lot to me,” said Boyle, who majors in mathematics. “It shows the hard work I have put in. But this award also has a lot to do with my teammates, 
who have helped me become a better player.”


A 2007 first-team All-Centennial Conference selection and four-time CC player of the week, Boyle currently leads the 16-5 Mules in scoring (14.6 ppg) and is 
second in assists (69), blocked shots (10) and steals (30). 

In the CC, Boyle ranks sixth in scoring, third in assist/turnover ratio (1.57), third in free-throw percentage (.783) and eighth in assists (3.29). 
The Wantage, N.J., native has scored in double figures in 15 of 21 games, including six 20-point efforts, and nearly recorded a triple-double at Gettysburg.

Boyle is 27 points shy of reaching the 1,000-point plateau and becoming only the third player in Muhlenberg history to achieve that in her junior season.

Bernardini has led the Mule men’s basketball team to an 8-6 conference record and a fourth-place tie with four games remaining in the regular season. 

Besides being Muhlenberg top scorer, contributing 14.3 points per game, the Langhorne, Pa., native averages team-high 30.8 minutes per contest. He is second on the team 
in assists with 2.1 per game and fourth in rebounds (4.3 per game).  

“It’s a great honor,” Bernardini said about his selection to the Team of the Year. “I appreciate the recognition and I hope that I’ll carry my performance to our 
last four games and possibly to the playoffs.”

Bernardini is also Mules’ most effective free-throw shooter, ranking first on the squad and fourth in the league with 82.8 percent successful attempts from line. 
He has also converted 33 treys on the season, averaging 1.74 per game, good enough for ninth place in the CC.

“Mike is a very versatile player, who helps us at both ends of the court,” Mules head coach Dave Madeira said. “He is a fine all-around player and one of our 
best one-on-one defenders. Mike does a great job of feeding the post and has the ability to get tough rebounds in traffic.”

Bernardini has led Muhlenberg in scoring seven times, including two 30-point efforts in back-to-back games against Gettysburg (31) and Johns Hopkins (32).

Questions and Answers






1. Whatâs the difference between an internship and a mentorship?




Definition

Work experience undertaken for the purpose of applying knowledge from the classroom to a practical work environment and actively reflecting on that activity. This can also be an experience that allows a student to gain insights into a profession. See row below about research internships.
Allows students to collaborate with a faculty member of choice in order to develop an original project. Similar to an independent study. This is meant to encourage independent research and original work.



Registration Requirement

Must submit an internship registration form to the Registrar within the internship registration deadline. It must be registered as a DNA credit (DNA 960).
Must discuss a research plan/proposal with the faculty sponsor you want to work with before registering for the mentorship. Must submit a mentorship registration form (same as independent study registration form) to the Registrar within the registration deadline. It must be registered as a DNA credit (DNA 970).



Research

Working as a research assistant to Faculty, you donât have authorship over the research. You are assisting the professor in their research.
Doing original research under supervision of faculty, find faculty whose research is related to your original research to be your âmentor.â



Final Product

Final reflection paper and weekly or bi-weekly logs submitted to the faculty internship supervisor.
It can take any form as long as it is agreeable to the student and the mentoring faculty member. It must beashareable form that reflects your work.
Science

Typically done in a research lab setting
May be collaborating with others in the lab, but must have individual research assignments with definite outcomes

Social Sciences/Humanities 

Independent research study supervised by a full-time Berg faculty which typically leads to a research paper

Arts

Can produce a research paperCan culminate in an original artistic production that should have some scholarly narrative associated with it

          2. What are the necessary components of a mentorship? Any specific requirements
that must be included?
  








A Dana Mentorship is similar to an independent study. Many Danas in the sciences do their Dana mentorship in a research lab setting and may be collaborating with others in the lab but they must have individual research assignments with definite outcomes. In social sciences and humanities, a Dana mentorship (DNA 970) typically is an independent research study supervised by a full-time Berg faculty which typically leads to a research paper. In the Arts, a Dana mentorship can also produce a research paper but can also culminate in an original artistic production that should have some scholarly narrative associated with it.






          3. Does the internship or mentorship have to align with my major?
  








It does not. However, most Danas try to meet major requirements through the Dana mentorships. It is possible if the major allows for an independent study to be counted as an elective for the major. Same goes for internships. If a major allows for an internship to count toward it, Danas tend to do an internship that will count for the major.






          4. How can you find an internship or mentorship? What are some good beginning
steps?
  








It is up to the students to contact faculty with similar interests. Speak to professors with research that interests you and approach them with any ideas for your own project. If they cannot work with you, ask if they can recommend another professor to reach out to. You can reach out to local organizations or various Muhlenberg administrative offices for internships as well. For example, the Career Center has a helpful âJob & Internship Searchâ guide.
For more information on finding internships, watch the video below:







          5. Whenâs a good time to start looking for internships or mentorships?
  








Second semester of Sophomore year is a good time to start planning for the internship and mentorship. Typically, Dana mentorships and internships occur during Junior and Senior years.






          6. When setting up mentorships with professors, what are some crucial points to go
over? How should we describe a Dana mentorship if theyâre unfamiliar with the
program and its requirements?
  








See questions 1 and 2. In addition, Danas should pursue mentorships in areas that interest them. Most Danas conduct research in their majors and minors and they take advantage of Muhlenberg faculty expertise. As previously mentioned, a mentorship is an independent research that is conducted under the supervision of a professor. If you or your prospective Dana mentor have questions, please arrange a meeting with Dr. Hashim.






          7. What makes an internship or mentorship count as 0.5 or 1.0 credits?
  









âIndependent Study/Research: Typically, no more than one course unit is awarded for each independent study/research course, and no fewer than 9-12 hours of work per week (Fall/Spring) or 126-168 hours per semester (Fall/Spring/Summer) are required for each course unit earned.â You may choose to pursue 0.5 credit unit mentorship (61-84 hours/semester). If you do so, you will need to pursue another 0.5 credit unit mentorship to meet the minumum Dana requirement of 1.0 credit of mentorship.
61-84 hours for 0.5 credit internship, 126-168 total hour for 1.0 credit internship

These numbers are from the Internship JotForm, linked at question 9









          8. Is it possible to get an internship/mentorship over the summer? Does doing an
internship/mentorship over the summer cost money?
  








Yes, it is possible to get an internship or mentorship over the summer. Unfortunately, it does cost extra. The bill, depending on the Dana mentorship/internship work/course load is for 1.0 or 0.5 credits of summer courses. Because of the additional billing, Danas are strongly encouraged to complete their mentorship and internship within the regular academic year so that they do not incur additional expenses.
Danas may apply for summer research grants as an option for completing their mentorship. These grants are competitive, but they provide a stipend to the student, as well as free housing for 8 weeks of summer research. More information about these grants can be found on Muhlenberg's Research and Scholarship website.






          9. How do you register your internship or mentorship to make sure you get Dana
credit? What are the codes for the different requirements? Are there any specific
forms we need to fill out?
  








The e-forms for mentorship (Independent Study/Research 970) and internship (960) are available on the Registrarâs webpage. Look for the appropriate Dana option (Dana mentorship or Dana internship) on the drop-down menu in each form. Check to ensure that you are coding your credit as a DNA credit.
Make sure you register a Dana mentorship as DNA 970 and a Dana internship as DNA 960.

Mentorship Form: https://form.jotform.com/203138259975162
Internship Form: https://form.jotform.com/203148295604152

Please reach out to Dr. Hashim if you have any questions regarding registering internships or mentorships as Dana credits.






          10. What have students in the past done for their internships and mentorships?
  








Here is a list of past examples, more can be found in past Dana Interviewer articles.






          11. How can I know what kind of research opportunities are available at the moment?
  








You have to take the initiative and reach out to professors in your areas of interest. You should also look at faculty webpages and talk to upper class students in your major or area of interest.
Use this link to find some faculty doing research in your area of interest (click on your major/minor/interest field, then look at faculty bios). If youâre pursuing a mentorship, you can look at faculty research and ask someone with similar research interests to be your mentor/mentorship advisor.






          12. Does research count as an internship or a mentorship?
  








Research counts as a mentorship. You should be doing research under supervision of a faculty mentor. If you are just serving as a research assistant for a professor and do not have authorship over the research, it is an internship.






          13. Does Dr. Hashim need to approve if the research is qualified as an internship or
mentorship? Or can it be up to the professor we reach out to?
  








Dr. Hashim does not need to get involved unless the professor and student need clarification over the requirements (content, hours, etc.) of mentorships and internships.






          14. Is research the only activity that can count for a mentorship?
  








In the Arts, an original artistic work (for example, a play, music composition, or a performance piece) can count as a mentorship. If there is any confusion, it is advisable for the Dana Scholar and the faculty mentor to consult with Dr. Hashim to ensure that the endeavor is a mentorship.

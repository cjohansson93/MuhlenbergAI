PINCH HITS, DEFENSE PROPEL BASEBALL COMEBACK 


With the Muhlenberg baseball team in the midst of a comeback and needing another hit to keep a rally going, sophomore Brian Beck came through in a pinch.

Beck belted a pinch-hit two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning with the Mules trailing by one, and that was all they needed in a 9-5 win over rival Moravian.




In addition to his great defensive plays, Vila doubled home the Mules first run of the game and scored the second.





I just wanted to find a pitch to drive and keep the inning going  maybe just a single, said Beck. But I guess I got more than that.

Becks timely tater came after Muhlenberg (5-5) pulled to within one run without any hits. With the Mules trailing 5-2 and one out in the inning, freshman Joseph Vila and senior Eric Pomroy drew back-to-back walks. A wild pitch then moved them both up a base, and a balk brought in Vila and put Pomroy on third. A two-out error scored another run before Beck was summoned off the bench for the go-ahead homer.

Great defense and one more big pinch hit helped Muhlenberg fend off Moravian (2-4) the rest of the way. Sophomore Jesse Nusbaum made a nice sliding catch to end the bottom of the sixth inning, and senior Dan Fisher made a remarkable play in the seventh, diving to his right for a hard-hit ball on the ground and throwing out the lead runner at second from his back.

Vila then made a great play to end the Greyhounds threat in the eighth. With one on and one out, Vila charged in for a diving catch and then got up and threw out the runner at first. It was the second time in the game that Vila doubled off a Moravian baserunner.

We made a lot of heads-up plays, noted Beck. We were down early but we stayed focused, and thats the key. Its a long a game and anything can happen.

Anything included a second big pinch hit, this time from freshman Jimmy Aramanda. The Mules had already plated one run in the seventh when Aramanda came to bat with two out and two on. He sprayed a base hit to right, bringing both runners in and expanding Muhlenbergs lead to four.

Jimmy did the same thing  he stayed back, waited for his pitch and drove it the other way, commented Beck. That was another big hit with two outs.

Senior Phil Cresta pitched eight innings, scattering 13 hits and holding Moravian scoreless for his final four innings on the mound. Fisher came in for the final three outs in the ninth.

Nusbaum and junior Joseph DiCecilia both went 2-for-5 at the plate.

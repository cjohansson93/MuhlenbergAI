About Me: I grew up in Bucks County, PA so I love that my recruitment territory includes so many familiar places. Outside of work, I stay busy taking care of my dogs and cats (all rescued!) as well as my plants. I'm very into DIY projects, including home renovation projects and crafting. I also love binging true crime documentaries or series anytime they come up on Netflix!
Advice for Prospective Students: My advice for embarking on the college process would be to check in with yourself after each campus visit or virtual connection. This process can feel long and sometimes experiences can get blurred. Take a few moments after a campus tour or meeting with an admissions counselor to make some notes about what stood out to you, how the people there made you feel, the kinds of conversations students were having around you, etc. Notes like this can be really helpful when it's down to the wire for finding your fit!
Favorite Food on Campus? My favorite food on campus has to be the falafel and hummus varieties in the Wood Dining Commons!

Thoreau wrote, âLaw never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice.â Societies and organizations depend on compliance and obedience in order to function. Markets suffer if rules are not followed, and societies do not thrive in a state of chaos. But governments and organizations can be morally corrupt; the United States once allowed people to be enslaved, and the tobacco industry deliberately withheld the risks of their potentially lethal product. Under these circumstances, obedience becomes complicity and disobedience becomes the ethical course of action. Thus groups of people and individual whistle-blowers are often called to acts of disobedience and subversion by injustice they observe or experience. Martin Lutherâs reformation, the American Civil Rights Movement, environmental activism, military draft-resistance, WikiLeaks, Occupy Wall Street, the African National Congress, Gandhiâs Indian independence movement, the Chiapas Rebellion, and the Arab Spring all represent significant rebellions against dominant authorities. The targets of dissent are not limited to governments, but also include economic, educational, religious, and social institutions that expect adherence to ideologies. In some cases, individuals and organizations engaged in disobedience may themselves engage in morally questionable activities. When is it ethical to rebel against authority? When do moral causes become more important than the rule of law or compliance with norms? What is the role of dissent in healthy democracies?  Should protest always be peaceful or is violence sometimes the right thing to do? When is âworking within the systemâ the best thing to do?

"Silencing Protest: On the Ethics and Politics of Social Theory"

Does history make protest or does protest make history? Do protests rise up through the fissures and structural instabilities of systems (e.g., capitalist, liberal, racial, environmental, sex/gender systems)? Or does protest create those fissures and instabilities? Do all the massive protests underway around the world since 2011, starting in Tunisia, share a time frame, an epoch, or are they making a time frame and thus making history? These are central questions of social theory today on the subject of protest. In my inquiry on how the time of protest is conceptualized in social theory, I find that although social theory on the times of protest is typically written by those whose political sympathies align with the protests they study, they have the perverse effect of silencing protest. In the gap between what happens in protest and what is said to have happened in social theory, I find five reasons to reconsider the ethics of social theory.

"From the Party of Lincoln to the Party of Calhoun: The Supreme Court and Voting Rights in Historical Perspective"

 In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that an important provision of the Voting Rights Act exceeded the powers of Congress. This talk will explain how the Supreme Court came to believe that a statute that passed with nearly unanimous support of Congress and is explicitly authorized by the 15th Amendment was unconstitutional. I will view Shelby County in the context of other attempts by the Supreme Court to limit the ability of Congress to protect civil rights. I will also discuss how mobilization (often in the fact of state violence) was crucial to the original Voting Rights Act, and the potential for mobilization to mitigate the damage of Shelby County. Lemieux writes about blogging as activism and voting rights. His research interests include public law, constitutional law, comparative law and institutions, and American politics. He has written or co-written articles for Polity, Studies in Law, Politics and Society, the Journal of Supreme Court History, the Maryland Law Review, and the American Journal of Comparative Law, and also contributes regularly to the American Prospect and the Guardian Online.

 Monday, September 22, 2014                        7:30PM      Recital Hall, Center for the Arts The Molly Maguires Film screening A 1970 film directed by Martin Ritt and starring Sean Connery, Richard Harris and Samantha Eggar, The Molly Maguires is based on the historical secret society of 19th century Irish-American coal miners who led a workerâs uprising in Pennsylvania coal country.

Erik Loomis U. Rhode Island "Resistance in the Pennsylvania Coal Country: Past and Present"
This talk will provide a quick history of resistance among the peoples of the Pennsylvania coal fields from the 19th century to the present, focusing on how corporate domination of the area, its people, and its natural resources has shaped residents' responses to the challenges of living in this resource-rich region. From the first coal strikes in the mid 19th century to the protests over fracking and President Obama's so-called "war on coal" today, the need to make a living and the desire to live in a safe and healthy environment has defined responses to the coal companies, making the lack of economic options a century ago and in the present vital to understanding why working people ally themselves with the coal companies who exploit them. Loomis studies U.S. environmental history and labor activism. He is working on the forthcoming book Empire of Timber: Work and Nature in the Pacific Northwest Forests. This visit will include a field trip to tour Pennsylvania coal mine country on Wednesday Sept 24 and will reference the Molly Maguires film screening the previous evening.

David Pellow U. Minnesota "Radical Politics, State Repression, and the Problem of âEco-Terrorismâ" To what extent are radical environmental and animal liberation movements also struggles over social inequality? In other words, to what degree are these movements that are typically seen as primarily focused on defending nonhuman animals and ecosystems also confronting oppression within human communities? What are the implications of the âeco-terroristâ label that states, corporations, and media impose on these groups? I consider these questions in relation to broader historical patterns of social movement struggles against oppression and the phenomenon of state repression directed at dissident groups. I conclude with a discussion of the productive links between radical earth and animal liberation movements and environmental justice movements. David Pellow's interests include environmental justice studies, racial and ethnic inequality, transnational social movements, and labor studies. He is the author of the forthcoming book Total Liberation: The Power and Promise and Animal Rights and the Radical Earth Movement. Library Resources for David Pellow

Carroll Bogert Deputy Executive Director of Human Rights Watch
"Can the U.S. Lead on Human Rights in the 21st Century?"

What do U.S. policy and U.S. actions on human rights look like in the 21st century? Does the U.S. possess the means to meaningfully protect human rights in such places as China, Russia, and the Middle East? Does the U.S. have the moral standing to intervene around the world in support of human rights? What is the U.S. role right now? What could it be?

Bogert studies human rights in the U.S. and abroad and media coverage of protest and human rights issues. Bogert is the 2014 Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow. Library Resources for Carroll Bogert A DVD of Carroll Bogert's talk is on reserve at Trexler Library under "Center for Ethics."

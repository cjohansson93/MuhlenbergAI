On Thursday, February 21, Pennsylvania's first-ever Redistricting Town Hall will initiate a community conversation about the effects of redistricting at the local and state level. The event will be held on campus at Muhlenberg College from 6-8:30 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum and it is free and open to the public. Expert panelists will discuss Pennsylvaniaâs recent redistricting and the actions that preceded the most recent legal battles.
Simultaneously, over a dozen Pennsylvania colleges and universities will host events on their campuses to both tune in to the conversation via Muhlenbergâs video portal and discuss the impact in their home districts. The live broadcast will be available through the video portal to the public as well.
Decades of partisan efforts led to Pennsylvania's ill-gained reputation as one of the nation's leading offenders of biased districting practices, or gerrymandering. The stateâs legislative districts have been in the national spotlight regarding this issue for the past several years.
Recently, Republican-drawn districts were the basis for a lawsuit that eventually reached the United States Supreme Court. The results of that case included a federal mandate for new district maps. An impasse between Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, and the Republican-led legislature led to newly drawn districts by the state supreme court in early 2018. The shakeup resulted in a confusing election cycle and new seats in the House of Representatives.
Muhlenbergâs Redistricting Town Hall Program Agenda
6-7 p.m.  What is Redistricting and Why & How Does it Matter?
Panelists include:

Carol Kuniholm, Fair Districts PA Chair
Amanda Holt, Lehigh County Commissioner

7-7:45 p.m. What Difference has Redistricting Made in Your District?
The live-stream from Muhlenberg will continue, though host sites are encouraged to use this time to discuss issues pertaining to their districts. 
Participating colleges and universities are encouraged to discuss the districts that affect their campuses. During this time, the conversation at Muhlenberg will continue to be live-streamed for the public and participating institutions to watch.
At Muhlenberg, Congresswoman Susan Wild of Pennsylvaniaâs 7th district will be joined by Benjamin Lieberman '19, a student who has undertaken significant research on redistricting, and Rubi Garcia, a senior political science and global studies major at Cedar Crest College.
7:45-8:15 p.m. Lessons Learned and A Call to Action

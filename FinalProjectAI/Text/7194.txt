Cross Country Teams Fifth at Centennial Meet

Field Hockey to Travel for Playoffs


The Muhlenberg field hockey regular-season finale had the intensity of a playoff match, and with good reason: A home playoff game was at stake.

Haverford scored 2:18 into overtime to spoil the Mules’ Senior Night and earn the right to host the postseason game. Muhlenberg (8-9, 6-4) will travel to Haverford (10-7, 6-4) for the Centennial Conference first-round game on Wednesday.

The Fords scored first on a penalty stoke seven minutes into the game, but freshman Emily Boyle knocked in a rebound four minutes later to tie the score. The Mules had an 11-0 edge in penalty corners in the first half but could only take advantage once.

 The second half was scoreless, although Muhlenberg dodged a bullet when Haverford hit the post on a penalty corner after time expired.

Competing in one of the strongest conferences in Division III, the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s cross country teams both finished fifth at the Centennial Conference Championships.

The men matched their finish from last season but improved their team score by almost 30 points, from 167 to 139. In a race in which the order of finish was nearly the same as last year’s, the Mules showed the greatest improvement in points.

Freshman Jaryd Flank (right) led Muhlenberg by coming in 20th. He is just the second freshman since 1994 to be the Mules’s top runner at the CC Championships. 

Junior Luke Munyan (30th), sophomore Stephen Sroka (31st), senior Bobby McGetrick (44th) and senior Charlie Kline (49th), in his first meet of the year, also placed in the top 50.

The women slipped a spot from their fourth-place finishes of the previous two years, but this was the first team in program history that they wound up in the top five in three straight seasons. They also finished ahead of Gettysburg, which came in ranked 10th in the region.

The women prevailed in a four-team race for fifth place, coming in three points ahead of Bryn Mawr, four ahead of Gettysburg and six in front of Ursinus.

Senior Nicki Cronin led Muhlenberg by crossing the finish line 19th. Sophomore Melanie Tramontina was 27th, an 18-place improvement from last year.

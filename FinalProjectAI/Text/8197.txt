Drug Policy Allianceâs NJ State Director to speak on war on drugs Oct. 20 at Muhlenberg College


Roseanne Scotti, the New Jersey state director for Drug Policy Alliance, will speak about whether the âWar on Drugsâ across America makes us safer or not.


	 Monday, October 19, 2015  10:26 AM

Scotti’s lecture will highlight the issues of harm reduction associated with HIV and drug policy. The lecture will take place at 6:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 20 in Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum. The event is free and open to the public.
Before joining the Drug Policy Alliance, Scotti, was a research coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Studies of Addiction in the HIV Prevention Research Division. As a research coordinator, she worked on various projects studying the incidence of HIV among injection drug users with the goal of designing effective prevention interventions. Scotti received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and her J.D. from Temple School of Law.
Scotti has authored and co-authored law review and medical journal articles on HIV prevention and drug policy. She founded the Prevention Point Philadelphia Harm Reduction Law Project, which provides free legal assistance for drug users and sex workers in Philadelphia.
In 2004, Scotti received the award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of HIV Prevention from the New Jersey HIV Prevention Community Planning Group. In 2005, she was appointed to New Jersey's Gang Land Security Task Force.
This lecture is presented by the Muhlenberg College’s Center for Ethics. Through thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members. The current Center Director is Chris Sistare, professor of philosophy and co-director of philosophy and political thought.
In academic year 2015-2016, the Center for Ethics will present programming on two themes: “Influence & Information: Whose Safety? Whose Security?” and “Influence & Information: Manipulation Nation”. While these themes overlap in significant ways, the Center will focus on exploring “Whose Safety? Whose Security?” in the fall semester and “Manipulation Nation” in the spring semester.

Volleyball garners win vs. garnet





Williams added 12 digs and three blocks to her 11 kills.



After dropping the first set, the Muhlenberg  volleyball team stood tall and won three in a row to snap a three-match Centennial Conference skid with a 3-1 win at Swarthmore.

The Garnet (5-14, 1-3) fielded only one player taller than 5-8, and the Mules (12-7, 2-3), who had five players taller than 5-8, used the height difference to their advantage.

Four of the five taller players recorded double figures in kills, led by junior Phylicia Lee, who tied her season high with 18 kills. Freshman Davi Gordon posted career highs in kills (12) and blocks (6), and junior Brittany Williams established a new career best with 11 kills. Freshman Jackie Price rounded out the quartet with 10 kills.

As a team, Muhlenberg totaled 62 kills, not far from the school record for a four-set match, 68 set vs. Swarthmore two years ago.

The Mules nearly pulled off a dramatic win in the first set, scoring five straight points after being down 24-18. Swarthmore broke the run with a kill to win, 25-23.

The roles were reversed in the next set, as the Garnet cut a 24-19 Muhlenberg lead to 24-23 before a kill by senior Megan Eiser evened the match.

Set no. 3 was tied at 20 before kills by Lee and Williams, combined with two Garnet attack errors, made the score 24-21. On set point, Gordon and junior Liz Dean combined on a block to put the Mules in front, 2-1.

Muhlenberg led the entire fourth set, building a 16-9 lead at one point. Swarthmore closed to within a point, at 22-21, before Gordon teamed up with Eiser for a block and then served an ace to build the lead back up to three. After a Garnet kill, Lee ended the match with her 18th kill.

Lee added 14 digs for her third double-double of the season, and senior Danielle Losonci had a career-high 21 digs. Eiser’s 48 assists were a career high.

Muhlenberg Named a Sierra Club âCool Schoolâ



The College once again was named to the list for its sustainability initiatives and environmental commitments.

On September 28, Muhlenberg was named a 2020 Sierra 'Cool School' based on campus sustainability initiatives. This year the College was ranked #75 in the nation, giving it the fourth-highest spot for a Pennsylvania school and the highest ranking of any college or university in the Lehigh Valley. Muhlenberg's position on the annual Sierra Club list has been rising steadily, beginning with a spot at #151 in 2014.
Sierra started ranking colleges 14 years ago based on their environmental commitments. According to their site, âa record 312 institutions participated in our annual Cool Schools rankingsâa remarkable feat, given the fact itâs been a school year like no other. Beyond having to suddenly pivot to virtual learning and community-building because of the coronavirus pandemic, many schools had to backtrack. Those that had phased out plastic bags and takeout containers, for example, found themselves having to bring them back to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols. Despite such setbacks, the schools on this list have shown incredible resourcefulness as they have innovated new ways to maintainâand in many cases, furtherâtheir sustainability objectives.â
As in past years, Sierra collaborated with the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) to gather the raw data for their rankings. They based their rankings on an institution's existing sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) score, then processed the STARS data through a custom-built formula that ranked the schools according to their own weighting criteria across 18 categories ranging from âcurriculumâ to âwater.â Muhlenberg earned a STARS Gold rating in 2019 in recognition of its sustainability achievements.
Earlier this fall, Muhlenberg had been once again named as one of the nation's best institutions for undergraduates, according to The Princeton Review. The publicationâs 29th annual edition of âThe Best 386 Collegesâ guide is based on surveys of 143,000 students from across the country who attend those schools.
The Princeton Review also named Muhlenberg a Best Value Collegeââbased on a combination of institutional and student survey data, including academic rigor, affordability and career outcomes for graduates, among othersââand a Green College based on its campus-wide sustainability efforts and commitments. These include a recently announced sustainability studies major, which joined a newly revised minor, last year. In February, Muhlenberg announced a joint, large-scale solar energy purchase, which along with other campus initiatives, enables the College to have a carbon-neutral electricity footprint for the first time.

Background B.A., Muhlenberg College M.A., University of Delaware Ph.D., Temple University
Dr. Susan Kahlenberg's research focuses on how media represent indices of vitality and power in our culture to determine potential links to societal attitudes and beliefs. More specifically, she has examined images of gender, race, occupation and marriage on prime time television, published in the Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, and the representation of academic, practical and technical intelligence on prime-time television, published in the text Representations of Intelligence in Popular Media. Her most recent research examines gender-role stereotypes in toy commercials airing on Nickelodeon during daytime television. She teaches Media and Society, Gender, Communication and Culture, Health Communication, Media, Theory and Methods, and Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.

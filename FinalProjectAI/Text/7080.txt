Women's Soccer, Volleyball Earn Redemption

Redemption was the theme of the day in Carlisle, where the Muhlenberg women’s soccer and volleyball teams both won tight Centennial Conference matches.

Women’s soccer won, 1-0, on a goal by senior Susan Galgano with 15 seconds left, and volleyball prevailed in five sets.

“That was my redemption goal,” said an elated Galgano after netting her first career goal at just the right moment – as a sophomore she had scored against Dickinson, only to have the goal disallowed by an offside call.

There was also redemption for the Mules (4-4-1, 2-1), who had a bad taste in their mouth after their last CC game, a 5-0 loss to top-ranked Johns Hopkins last Saturday.

Dickinson (4-4-2, 0-1-2) had a 17-8 advantage in shots, but the game went back and forth, with both teams having scoring chances. Senior Amanda Wong
turned away five Red Devil shots to earn her second shutout of the season.

With time winding down, sophomore Nicole Karsch played the ball back to Galgano, who put it into the upper 90 from about 45 yards away.

It was the second straight year Muhlenberg defeated Dickinson 1-0 on a late goal; last year the score came with nine minutes left.

“I was not expecting to score today,” said Galgano (right). “After the game everybody rushed off the bench and hugged me. It was pretty surreal.”

Volleyball redeemed itself after losing in five sets last year to a Dickinson team that came in with a record of 1-11.

The Mules (8-5, 2-1) started out slowly, losing the first set, 25-16, but won the next two and then pulled out the decisive fifth set, 15-12.

Freshman Allison Glass (left) recorded three of her team-high 14 kills in the fifth set, in which Muhlenberg jumped out to an 8-3 lead and held off the Red Devils from there.

Sophomore Katherine Boll also hit double figures in kills with 10, and she was one of five players who combined for 13 blocks in the match. Sophomore Joanne Josephson contributed a career-high eight.

Setters Nikki Dickson and Vanessa Pulice combined for 36 assists, with sophomore Chelsea Kaser (13 digs) and freshman Elizabeth Garrison (12 digs) leading the defense.

The win broke a stretch of 10 straight matches that ended in 3-0 sweeps one way or the other for Muhlenberg.

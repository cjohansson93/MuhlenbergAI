daniels, antonini repeat on first team


The Muhlenberg mens soccer team placed a league-high six members on the All-Centennial Conference team, including three seniors who earned honors for the first time in their final season.

Senior Jason Daniels and 



junior Cody Antonini were both repeat selections on the first team.

Daniels (left) had phenomenal statistics in CC games, posting a league-leading 0.28 goals-against 


average and a .938 save percentage. Overall, he has a 0.60 GAA and CC-best .860 save percentage. This is the fourth straight year the Mules goalie has made the All-CC first team; Daniels is only 



the second keeper in program history to earn first-team all-conference honors in back-to-back years. The other was Mark Maehrer in 1987 and 1988.

Antonini (right) was one of two unanimous picks on the All-CC team. He leads the CC in goals (16) and is second in points (37). Antoninis points total is the highest by a Muhlenberg player since 1987, and he has the most goals by a Mule since 1995.

Making the second team were sophomore forward Danny Way and senior back Eric Williams. Way is third in the CC with 22 points and has scored 10 goals, including two in the Mules CC semifinal win against Franklin & Marshall. Williams, at center back, is the leader of the defense that allowed only three goals in nine CC games.

Senior midfielder Mike Williams and senior back Matt Cecconi received honorable mention. Williams scored 6 of his career-high 16 points in the CC playoffs and leads the Mules with 6 assists. Cecconi, the most experienced member of the back four, has started every game at right back and was named CC defensive player of the week earlier in the season.

This is the fifth time in the 18 years of the CCs existence that at least six Muhlenberg players have landed on the All-CC team. The Mules finished second in the CC in both the regular season and tournament and will face Keene State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday.

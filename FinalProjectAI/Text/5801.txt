Women’s Soccer Settles for Tie


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team was forced to settle for a 2-2 tie with Dickinson after the Red Devils scored on a corner kick with 1:05 left in regulation.

The Mules (5-1-3, 2-0-1) outshot Dickinson 8-1 in the first half and took the lead in the 25th minute when senior Maura Hendsey beat the goalie from six yards to 
score her first goal this season. Sophomore Kimberly Hacker assisted on the play to record her first point this year.

Sophomore Kasey Hacker doubled the lead ten minutes later with a perfectly placed 22-yard shot that found the top corner of goal. 

Dickinson, the Centennial Conference’s second-highest scoring team, came back in the second half, scoring a goal early in period before converting a late corner kick to 
push the game to overtime. The Mules had a 5-1 advantage in shots during overtime and had one shot that hit the post, but neither team was able to break the stalemate. 

The tie extended Muhlenberg’s unbeaten streak in CC regular-season matches to nine.

Moral victories don’t count in the standings, but the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team had every reason to feel proud after its 2-1 loss to Johns Hopkins in a
scintillating cap to Homecoming weekend.

The Mules held the Blue Jays, the top scoring team in Division III, more than three goals below their average. And for the last 30 minutes, it was hard to tell which team



Assous is now in double figures in both goals (10) and assists (13) for his career.




was undefeated and ranked eighth in the country.

Muhlenberg (5-3, 2-2) struggled to keep possession in the early going, but scored the first goal of the game when junior Brendan Carroll found senior
Karim Assous behind the Hopkins backs on a counterattack. Assous drilled a shot on the ground inside the far post with 16:25 elapsed for his second goal of the season.

The Blue Jays (11-0, 4-0) tied the score less than seven minutes later and went ahead three minutes into the second half. Hopkins, which won nine of its first
10 matches by at least three goals and scored eight goals in each of its previous two games, kept up the pressure, forcing senior Peter Bennett to make two nice saves on 
close shots. 

As the half went on, the Mules began to gain confidence, stringing passes together and winning 50-50 balls. They had two golden opportunities to tie the game, both on shots
by junior Billy Dalton. In the 69th minute, his shot was headed out of the goal by a Hopkins back, and 15 minutes later he hit the crossbar.

With time running down, Muhlenberg pulled out all the stops, even sending Bennett into the box on a corner kick. The tall goalie got his head on the ball, but the Mules
could not score the equalizer.

Muhlenberg finished a stretch of five games against opponents with a combined record of 31-4-1 by going 2-3. All five games were decided by a single goal.

No crown, but a win for volleyball 


Although she was a member of the Homecoming Court, it was a different court that took precedence for Brittany Williams.

Williams recorded a team-high 15 kills to help lead the Muhlenberg volleyball team to a 3-1 Homecoming win against Dickinson.

One of five finalists for Homecoming Queen, Williams put her

team responsibilities first. The Mules were just finishing off their 25-16 win in the first set of the Dickinson match when the Homecoming Court processed to the 50-yard line at Scotty Wood Stadium at halftime of the football game. Standing in place of Williams were her older sister Courtney Williams ’07, a former Muhlenberg volleyball player, and Courtney’s boyfriend’s 3-year-old daughter, Rachel Matthews.

“I was honored to be nominated, and at first I was a little upset that I couldn’t walk [with the rest of the Homecoming Court],” admitted Williams. “But if I couldn’t have that experience, I’m glad Courtney and Rachel did. Rachel loved it – she thought she was a princess.”

Williams said she was so focused on the match she didn’t think about what was going on outside Memorial Hall. “We played so well as a team together. The rallies went fast and you just forgot about everything else.”

The second set wasn’t much to remember, as the Red Devils, who in their last match came back from a 2-0 hole to defeat Johns Hopkins in five, evened the score with a 25-17 win. But then Muhlenberg won two close sets, 25-23 and 26-24, to defeat Dickinson (5-10, 2-1) for the first time in four years.

In the fourth set, the Mules (5-9, 1-2) trailed 24-21 before reeling off the last five points behind the serving of sophomore Jackie Price.

“In practice we always try to focus on short games to five – who can get five points,” said Williams. “It was great to see everyone step up. We have so much potential, and we’ve just fallen short a few times.”

Williams added 14 digs to her 15 kills to surpass 500 digs for her career. Senior Christina Cangelosi recorded 33 digs to move into fifth place on the Mules’ all-time list with 1,216. Freshman Jennifer Seeba had nine kills and six blocks, and senior Phylicia Lee notched four of her seven kills in the decisive fourth set.

It all added up to the Mules ruling the court, even though one of them didn’t end up with the crown.

“Tomorrow’s my birthday, so it’s just a great weekend,” said Williams. “I’m so happy for [Homecoming Queen] Quila [Israelson] and [Homecoming King] Adam [Rogers]. I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.”

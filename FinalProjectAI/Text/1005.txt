FAQ FOR MANDATORY REPORTERS AT MUHLENBERG COLLEGE
 
Who is a Mandatory Reporter at Muhlenberg College?
All College employees (faculty, staff, and student employees) are mandatory reporters of identity- based discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, stalking, retaliatory harassment, and criminal behavior that they become aware of occurring on College property, at a College event, or allegedly involving a member of the College community (faculty, staff, or student).
Why are we Mandatory Reporters of these incidents?
The College has legal obligations under certain federal civil rights laws such as Title IX, Title VI, Title VII, the Clery Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, among other applicable laws, to promptly address any incident of certain discrimination or criminal behavior prohibited by these laws and put in place measures to prevent recurrence. The College has determined that given the small and close-knit nature of Muhlenbergâs campus and the resulting close relationships that faculty, staff, and students can develop with each other, all employees are designated as mandatory reporters of all incidents described above.
Is there anyone who is not a Mandatory Reporter?
Yes. Employees who are specifically trained and licensed to be confidential are not mandatory reporters when they are acting in a confidential capacity. The following are confidential employees:

Counselors 
Health providers 
Clergy

I am a Mandatory Reporter â where do I report?

Report identity-based discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, stalking, and retaliatory harassment to the Office of Equity & Title IX.
Report criminal conduct, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, stalking, and retaliatory harassment to Campus Safety.
Filing an online incident report for non-emergencies will satisfy your mandatory reporting obligation to the Office of Equity & Title IX and Campus Safety: www.muhlenberg.edu/report

 
What information do I include in a report?
Include in your report as much information as you have. Mandatory reporters should not conduct their own investigation, however, if you learn of the following information, please include in your report:

 names of all involved parties including the complainant, accused, and witnesses
 date, time, and location of alleged incident
 any details of the incident shared by the complainant
 whether the complainant requested confidentiality
 whether the complainant requested no action be taken
 any other relevant facts

If someone is talking to me and I start to realize itâs going to be a mandatory report, should I say anything?
You are not required to disclose you are a mandatory report to someone who is giving you information. Usually, it is helpful in maintaining a trusting and reliable relationship to disclose that you are a mandatory reporter. Here are some suggestions as to what you can say:


 âI am sorry this happened to you. It sounds like a stressful situation. As you may know, I am a mandatory reporter for any incident I learn of that is [insert issue], and I want to make sure you are connected with the appropriate resources on campus. I have to report this to the Office of Equity & Title IX [and Campus Safety] but they will reach out to you first before anything else happens (unless there is clear threat or evidence of present harm to self, others, or community, in which case you would immediately call Campus Safety). If you want to keep it confidential, please let them know. We also have confidential resources on campus at the Counseling Center, Health Center, or our College or Jewish Chaplain if you would like confidential support.â


Are there any times where I am not a Mandatory Reporter?
You are a mandatory reporter when you are acting in your capacity as an employee, or perceived to be acting in your capacity as an employee. Additionally, disclosures made at community-wide awareness events such as candlelight vigils, protests, âsurvivor speak outs,â or other community-wide events or forums in which students may disclose an incident does not trigger a mandatory reporterâs reporting obligation. The Director of Equity and Title IX and Campus Safety should be made aware of such events so that the respective offices can provide resource information to students at these events.
I have developed trusting relationships with students and I am worried that students will not trust me if I am required to report what they are telling me. Can I withhold reporting if someone asks me not to report it?
No. You are still required to report information you become aware of. However, you may provide support to the student who has disclosed an incident by letting them know about confidential resources - who are not mandatory reporters - on campus:

Counselors at the Counseling Center

 Health providers at the Student Health Center

 College Chaplain or Jewish Chaplain

You can also let the student know that information in the report is only disclosed to the Office of Equity & Title IX and Campus Safety whose offices treat the information as privately as possible.  The Office of Equity & Title IX and Campus Safety may also be able to provide interim accommodations that can help the student. Finally, the student who disclosed (absent evidence of harm or threat to self, others, or community, pattern, predation, violence, or use of weapon) has the power to decide if they want the College to do nothing or if they want the College to move forward with further action. You may accompany the student as an advisor/support person if they would like you to act in that capacity.

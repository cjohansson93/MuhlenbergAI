Girolamo hosted 'The Italian Hour' on radio station WKAP between 1953 and 1958, and then moved to Rome.
In 1975, he returned to Allentown, Pa. where he started the 'Italian Hour' on radio station WHOL. From 2007 until December 2009, Raffaele started hosting "Festa D'Italia" on WEST.
Raffaele, fluent in Italian, presents the program with a bi-lingual style unmatched by anyone on Italian radio. Having real-world experience in Italy, Raffaele shares his Italian stories and music history each week. Raffaele is also a musician, graduating with two diplomas from the prestigious Accademia Lanaro in Rome, Italy.

freshmen honored for defense in upsets



Two Muhlenberg freshmen were honored by the Centennial Conference for their defensive roles in upset wins.

Maggie Neary (right) was named defensive player of the week in women’s soccer. Neary played every minute at center back in

consecutive upsets of No. 16 Swarthmore (2-1) and No. 7 Johns Hopkins (2-0). The Mule defense held the two teams, which both came in averaging more than 17 
shots per game, to a total of 15 shots, just seven on goal. Hopkins’ only previous losses had come to top-10 teams (Messiah and William Smith).

Neary made a defensive save in the Hopkins game late in the second half with Muhlenberg clinging to a 1-0 lead. Although there are still two weeks to play in the
regular season, the two wins put the Mules in the driver’s seat for the top seed in the CC playoffs.

Kristen Dornenburg (left) was named defensive player of the week in field hockey. She recorded 11 saves to become the first goalie to shut out No. 10 
Johns Hopkins this year in the Mules’ 1-0 double-overtime win. Click here to watch a video of the
winning goal on YouTube.

In two games on the week, Dornenburg recorded a 0.42 goals-against average and .950 save percentage. She also stopped eight shots in a 4-1 win vs. Swarthmore, 
allowing her only goal of the week on a penalty stroke. Dornenburg leads the CC in save percentage (.817) and is third in goals-against average (1.45).

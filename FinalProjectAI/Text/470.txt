Whisper PartyJF Lynch

JF Lynch's installation Whisper Party uses ordinary objects to create a site specific drawing and assemblage work in our Galleria Space.Lynch employs a constellation of found materials which are stacked and erected into towers and hung on walls. These pieces are interrupted with drawings that curl and wrap through the varied elements and extend on to the 3D objects and walls beyond. Resembling altars, viewers might wonder whether they're looking at a site of worship or a work of art to be appreciated for its own sake.â

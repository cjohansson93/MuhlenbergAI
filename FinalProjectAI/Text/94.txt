En el tiempo de las mariposas
(In the Time of the Butterflies)
Sept. 30 â Oct. 3, 2021
A Play by Caridad Svichbased on a novel by Julia Alvarez
a staged reading directed byLeticia Robles-Moreno
Las hermanas Mirabal had everything â families, children, safety. The one thing they lacked was their freedom, living in the Dominican Republic under the despotic regime of Rafael LeÃ³nidas Trujillo, one of the bloodiest dictatorships in the Americas. Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa organized a Liberation Movement to help overthrow Trujillo, sacrificing their lives to work in the resistance. DedÃ© was the sister who survived to tell their story.
Based on a true story, this powerful play unveils the women behind the myth, and embraces their legacy for Latina feminist empowerment.

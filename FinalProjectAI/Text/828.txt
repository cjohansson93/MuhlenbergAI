The James D. Schneider Memorial Award for Social Justice
Every year the department honors one of our graduating seniors with the James D. Schneider Award for Social Justice. This award is given in honor of our late colleague, Dr. Jim Schneider, who worked tirelessly to advance the cause of social justice both within the department and in his community volunteer efforts in the Lehigh Valley. Each year we bestow this award upon a Media and Communication graduating senior who has pursued these values in their work at the College, both in and out of the classroom. This award may go either to one of the honors students or to another graduating senior major.

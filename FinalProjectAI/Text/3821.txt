Rice is nice, againat CC track and field championships





Rice is just the second Mule mens athlete to be named the Most Outstanding Track Performer at both the indoor and outdoor championships during the same year.



During the 1940s, Felix Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis were known as Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside for the U.S. Military Academys football team.

The Muhlenberg track and field team has its own version of Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside, but it only takes one record-setting Mule to fill both roles.

For the second time in the less than three months junior Peter Rice earned the Most Outstanding Performer for track events as he helped the Mule men's team to a third-place finish at the Centennial Conference Outdoor Track and Field Championships. 

It's the third year in a row Muhlenberg has finished third at the outdoor meet; the Mules also placed third at the last two indoor meets for five straight top-three finishes.

Rice, who also earned the most outstanding award at the indoor championships, won gold in all four of his events, broke two of his own individual school records and helped the 4x400 relay set a new Mule mark. He has won 12 CC gold medals during his career, the most ever by a Mule male.

Its definitely an honor to win the most outstanding award again, Rice said. I didnt expect it going into the indoor meet, but this time I really felt the pressure of running with a target on my back. So Im really proud I was able to do it again with everybody gunning for me.

Of course two of those golds came in relays, so it has as much to do with my teammates as it does me. They worked their tails off and put us into position to win.




In addition to winning bronze in the 100 hurdles, Carnevale helped the 4x100 relay team place fourth.




His golden day started when he anchored the 4x100 relay team of himself, senior Derek Yates, sophomore Isaiah Vaughn and freshman Darnell Davis to victory. Its the third straight year Muhlenberg has won the 4x100, and the one common thread on all three of those teams has been Rice.
 
MV-Pete, as hes known to his teammates, then replicated the 200, 400 double he accomplished at the indoor meet.




Torphy has won 15 CC medals during his Mule career.




He breezed to victory in the 400 by an entire second, breaking his own school mark with a time of 48.09. That time, a provisional qualifier for the NCAA Championships, is the ninth-best time in Division III this season through meets completed on Friday.

I think that time should get me into NCAAs, Rice said. But we still have one more qualifier, and I definitely think I can go faster."

The 200 was more of the same as Rice crossed the finish line alone and lowered his school metric record to 22.05. 

But Rice saved his best performance for last when he took the baton in third place in the 4x400 relay. He caught up to the leader by the 300-meter mark and then pulled away to give the Mule team of Rice, Davis and freshmen Jake Ullmann and Andrew Onimus a convincing win in a school-record time of 3:19.53. 

I knew that [my teammates] were going to be able to get me the baton in great position, and when they do that much for you, you cant really let them down, Rice said. The silver I got in indoors was in a relay, and those are the ones I really care about winning because theyre about who is the fastest team. So Im really proud that we were able to come away with two golds this time.

Vaughn also medaled in the 200, winning bronze to go along with his gold in the 4x100 relay.

Senior Bobby Torphy provided some dramatics in his final CC Championships. Torphy used a strong finishing kick to make a pass with less than 50 meters remaining to move into third place and claim bronze. 

Muhlenbergs third-place finish in the team race was strengthened by the return of junior Marc Brookland. After missing most of the indoor meet because of injury, Brookland took bronze in the triple jump to go along with the bronze he won in the long jump on Saturday.
 
The Muhlenberg womens team finished seventh, led by freshman Stephanie Carnevale who picked up the womens lone individual medal, taking bronze in the 100-meter hurdles.

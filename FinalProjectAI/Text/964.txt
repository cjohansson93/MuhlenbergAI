 Research in the Lab of Dr. Amy T. Hark

Welcome to the Hark Lab!
We investigate the effects of DNA packaging and genome organization on gene function.Please visit us in Room 223, New Science Building.

Dr. Hark and Natalie Trachtman '20
My research interests focus on the regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotic organisms. In particular, I am interested in how factors such as covalent modifications of histones, chromatin structure/architecture, and gene organization may act and interact to influence gene expression.
 
Impact of histone acetylation on plant development
Background on HATs and Histone Acetylation
One area of current research investigates the biological role of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzyme GCN5 in developmental pathways in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. GCN5 can covalently modify histones (chromatin proteins) by catalyzing the addition of acetyl group to specific lysine residues. This modification is hypothesized to affect histone-DNA contacts or provide binding sites for other factors involved in regulating transcription (the histone code hypothesis). Misregulation of histone acetylation states has been implicated in cancer and developmental disorders.
Background on Arabidopsis
Why study chromatin modifying factors in Arabidopsis?
First, a little bit of background. Arabidopsis is a flowering plant, in the Brassica family, related to plants you are probably more familiar with such as broccoli and cauliflower. Arabidopsis has emerged as an experimental model for a number of reasons. For me, Arabidopsis also provides a model system to explore gene regulation in the context of its effects on fundamental developmental events, which is one of my areas of interest. Also, there has been a long history of the study of epigenetic effects on gene expression in plants, but relatively little is known about the roles chromatin-modifying factors such as GCN5 play.
Background on Our Research
In collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth McCain, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the gcn5 mutant phenotype, as one way to help us identify specific GCN5 developmental targets.  Our latest work in this area was published in a series of recent micropublications. Check out the links below for more details.

Genomics Education Partnership

This project is part of my collaboration with the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; thegep.org).  In short, this work in comparative genomics involves using in silico (computer-based) analysis to annotate genes in Drosophila species (defining their start/stop sites,  exon/intron boundaries, etc.).  We have previously focused on how chromatin structure and gene structure and organization act and interact to impact gene function, which connects to my basic research interests and work of other members of the Hark Lab.  More recently, we have begun applying our annotation skills to ask questions of how gene networks evolve.  This collaborative research allows students to be part of a large-scale project and have their work published while increasing their knowledge of fundamental molecular biology and research tools.
 
âCurrent and Recent Lab Membersâ
There are opportunities for students to carry out research to address these and related questions in the field of molecular biology. I encourage you to contact me if you are interested in doing research in the lab, so that we may talk more about your area(s) of interest and potential projects.





Zachary Lill â21 (below) spearheaded our work on a new GEP collaborative project, which investigates how the insulin signaling pathway evolves in Drosophila species. Benjamin Chen â22, Viet Le â22, Jonah Silverman â22, and Sarah Teitelbaum â22 have also engaged in this research project.




 











Natalie Trachtman '20 (left) and Iffat Imran '20 worked on GEP projects in Spring and Fall 2018 and continued this work in Spring 2019.  Natalie engaged in work to understand how GCN5 impacts trichome initiation in plants during Summer 2019.







 








Patrick Sockler '19 (right) and Josh Shaffer '19 joined the lab in Fall 2017 to work on the comparative genomics project and both also transitioned to the plant development project.








Sam Tener '18 sperheaded a new colaboration with Dr. Scott Woody and Dr. Rick Amasino at the University of Wisconsin, exploring possible connections between GCN5 and gibberellin signalling in plant development.
Emily Chiacchiaro '19 has also joined this latter effort.  Both Sam and Emily initially worked on the GEP project.








Nate Wiggley '20 and Nina Hernandez joined the GEP group in Fall 2018. 
John Hanna '19 worked on both a pedagogical project and gene annotation in Fall 2018.Both Nate and John continued their work in Spring 2019.








Hanna Caiola '18 (bottom left) and Hannah Molk '18 (bottom right) started in the lab working on the Drosophila in silico genomics project and then transitioned to wet-lab work investigating putative GCN5 targets that impact trichome development.

brewer named to academic all-america team



Even though Ashley Brewer picked up her diploma four days ago, she is still picking up awards for her accomplishments as a Muhlenberg student and athlete.

Brewer was named to the 2011 Capital One Academic All-America® Softball Team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

A third-team selection, Brewer is the first Academic All-American for the softball program since Val Verenna in 1993. She also is only the second Mule in any sport to be named Centennial Conference player of the year and an Academic All-American; football player John DeLuca was the first in 2008.

The two-time CC player of the year also has received the honors of All-East Region first team, All-CC first team, CC co-pitcher of the week, Academic All-District first team and LVAIAW Outstanding Athlete this month. 

A chemistry major and mathematics minor, Brewer graduated cum laude with honors in chemistry.

Brewer led Muhlenberg to the CC championship and 25 wins (one short of the school record) in 2011. She topped the team in almost every hitting and pitching category, smashing school records for home runs (7, old record was 4) and RBI (51, old record was 36) in a season. She hit .409 with a school-record-tying 20 extra-base hits, a school-record 93 total bases and a .679 slugging percentage. In the circle, she went 13-8 with a 2.61 ERA and a school-record-tying 20 complete games.

For her career, Brewer hit .379 and finished as the programs all-time leader in home runs (13) and RBI (93). She also ranked second in extra-base hits, total bases and slugging percentage, third in runs scored, hits and stolen bases, sixth in batting average and eighth in on-base percentage.

To be eligible for Academic All-America® consideration, a student-athlete must be a varsity starter or key reserve, maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.30 on a scale of 4.00 and have reached sophomore athletic and academic standings at her current institution.
 
Since the programs inception in 1952, CoSIDA has bestowed Academic All-America honors on more than 14,000 student-athletes in Divisions I, II, III and NAIA, covering all NCAA championship sports.

Cold Shooting Plagues Women's Basketball at DeSales
 Saturday, December 14, 2013 - page 2







					 




Winter continued its stay in eastern Pennsylvania over the weekend, bringing more snow and frigid temperatures. Unfortunately for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team, 
its shooting was as cold as the weather.

The Mules shot a season-low 27.5 percent from the field and dropped their fourth straight game, 56-46 at DeSales. Muhlenberg (4-4) missed all seven of its three-point attempts and 
committed 27 turnovers as the Bulldogs turned a tight game into a comfortable victory over the final 12 minutes.

Despite their struggles from the field, the Mules hung around until midway through the second half on the strength of a strong defensive performance. 
The Bulldogs (6-2) shot just 28.8 percent themselves, their worst performance of the season, and found themselves ahead by just two points (35-33) when Muhlenberg 
junior Emily Lesher sliced to the bucket for a layup at the 12:37 mark of the second half. 

But the Mules went more than 10 minutes without a field goal, 
unable to get anything going against a team that entered the game ranked in the top 25 in Division III in forcing turnovers. DeSales scored 15 of the next 16 points to put the game out of reach.

Lesher (right) tied her career high with 12 points and added five rebounds for the Mules, who got the same numbers from classmate Leanna Tallamy.

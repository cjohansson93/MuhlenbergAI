same story, different nightfor men’s basketball



The consolation game of the Greyhound Starters Classic was a bad case of déjà vu for the Muhlenberg mens basketball team.
  
For the second night in a row the Mules stormed out of the gates hard and went into the locker room with the lead. But just like it did against Manhattanville in the first round, 
Muhlenberg went cold after the break.

Wentworth Tech (4-6) took advantage and pulled ahead midway through the second half. The Leopards would never relinquish their advantage and held on for a 54-50 win.

Behind 10 points from junior Spencer Liddic and 7 and 6 points from sophomore Rob Berish and freshman Kevin Hargrove, respectively, the Mules (5-5) led by as many as 16 in the first half.

Hargrove (left) also added 5 blocks in the half as Muhlenberg limited Wentworth Tech to 25.8 percent shooting at the break. That defensive effort helped give the Mules a 32-19 halftime advantage.

But as Muhlenberg started to struggle offensively in the second half, the Leopards' shooting heated up. Wentworth Tech hit six 3-pointers after halftime and finally pulled ahead for good with 9:36 to play.

Muhlenberg did pull within one on a 3-pointer by freshman Austin Curry with 3:57 left, but the Leopards responded with back-to-back buckets and a late free throw to give the Mules their third loss in the last four games by less than five points.

Liddic once again led the Mules with 15 points to go along with 9 rebounds, earning a spot on the all-tournament team.
Curry added 8 points, including a pair of 3-pointers. Berish and sophomore Matt OHara contributed 4 assists apiece.

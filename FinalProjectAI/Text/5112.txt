 Cangelosi Earns Honor at Gordon



Senior Christina Cangelosi was named to the all-tournament team after the Muhlenberg volleyball team went 1-2 at the Gordon Invitational.

The Mules (1-3) swept the host school in their first match, then lost a tough five-setter to Wheaton. They fought hard in a tight four-set match before losing to Endicott.

Cangelosi recorded 79 digs in the three matches, averaging 6.58 per set and notching a career-high 36 digs vs. Endicott. In the process, she became the 10th player in program history with 1,000 career digs; she now has 1,007.

The all-tournament honor was the second in Cangelosi’s career. She was also recognized at last year’s Scranton Invitational.

For the second time in its opening week, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team outshot a nationally ranked opponent from the New Jersey Athletic Conference only to fall on the short end of a 2-1 final.

This time the opponent was Montclair State, winner 



Senior Adison Weseloh, here defending against Montclair State co-captain Mike Krol, was the last Mule to score a goal in the first three games of the season (2007).



of 21 straight regular-season games. The Red Hawks, ranked seventh in the Division III preseason poll, lost only one match all of last year – to eventual national champion Messiah.

The game was much closer than Tuesday’s 2-1 loss to No. 20 Richard Stockton, with the Mules enjoying a 17-13 edge in shots in the back-and-forth contest. Montclair (3-0) scored on a pair of setpieces – the second with 16:16 left to break a 1-1 tie. 

Sophomore Cody Antonini scored Muhlenberg’s lone goal with a shot from the 18 in the final 10 minutes of the first half. He is only the second Mule in the last 20 years to score a goal in each of the first three games of a season.

• Women’s Soccer: Muhlenberg opened the season with a 2-0 loss to Oneonta State at Kean’s Cougar Classic. The Red Dragons are a formidable foe who have been in the NCAA Tournament 10 straight years, including one appearance (2003) that resulted in a national championship.

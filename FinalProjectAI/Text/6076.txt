Cross Country Teams Strong at Dickinson Long-Short
 Saturday, September 24, 2011 - page 2







					 


The longs far outweighed the shorts when the Muhlenberg cross country teams ran at the Dickinson Long-Short Invitational. 

Big Spring High School in Newville, Pa., the site of this year’s Centennial Conference Championships, was the site for the meet. All but two 

of the other CC schools competed at the meet, and the Mules fared very well in their first time running on the course, which was hilly and muddy.

The meet consisted of a long race (8K for men, 6K for women) and a 


short race (4K for both). Teams split up their personnel between the two runs, with the top three in each race counting toward the team score.

The men finished in fourth place overall, coming up one point short of Johns Hopkins. The three teams they trailed are ranked second (Dickinson), fourth (Carnegie Mellon) and fifth (Johns Hopkins) in the Mideast Region. The Mules finished ahead of York, ranked ninth in the region, as well as Christopher Newport and Mary Washington, who are ranked in the top 10 in the South/Southeast Region.

The women had only two runners in the long race, so they did not record a team score. They were second 

only to Dickinson, the second-ranked team in the region, in the short race.

Both Muhlenberg teams showed that they are long on ability.

Junior Samantha Mayden (left) placed third out of 178 runners in the 6K, and sophomore Nicki Cronin  was third in the 4K. Both earned t-shirts for finishing in the top 10.

For the men, senior William Lowrey was the top finisher, coming in 14th in the short 4K. Freshman Kenny Wohl (right) crossed the line 34th in the long race. Many of the Mules in that race were freshmen running their first 8K or athletes returning from injury who hadnt run an 8K in a long time.

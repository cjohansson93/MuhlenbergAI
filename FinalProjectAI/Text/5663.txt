track sophs shatter records at armory





Chris Dolan was one of two freshmen on the 4x800 team; Bobby Torphy was the other. Sophomore Patrick Thornton rounded out the quartet.


Muhlenberg sophomores Alex Faust and Debra Crockett distanced themselves from themselves at the Lafayette Rider Winter Games.

Both athletes shattered their own school records by considerable margins. Faust ran the 200 meters in 26.23, breaking the mark of 26.81 she tied at the same meet last year. Crockett threw the shot put 37 feet, 10¾ inches, adding more than a foot to her previous record of 36-8½.

The New York City Armory is considered the fastest indoor track in the country, and the Mule men’s team took advantage of the banked surface to produce four ECAC qualifiers.

Junior Stuart Udis qualified in the 500 meters with a time (1:08.03) that missed the school record by a mere five one-hundredths of a second. Junior Timothy Van Syckle, who earlier this year qualified for ECACs in the 5,000 meters, added the 3,000 by crossing the finish line in 8:52.92.

Junior David Chorney hit ECAC marks in two events, individually in the mile (4.20.92) and as part of the 4x800-meter relay team (8:03).

Sophomore Jeremiah Lachaud missed the school record in the 200 meters by a tenth of a second.

more low scores for men’s golf


Although the Muhlenberg men's golf team didn't make up any ground on the second day of the Penn State Harrisburg Invitational, 




it put up some more impressive scores.

The Mules shot a 305, two strokes 


better than they did in the first round. Unfortunately, the host school
 also shot a 305 to maintain its four-stroke lead and take home the tournament title.
The 305 was the lowest score for Muhlenberg in two years, and for the second straight 




Lowest Rounds (since 1990)

day Muhlenberg had four golfers shoot in the 70s.

Leading the way with a 1-under-par 71 was sophomore Brandon Davis (left), who shot the low round of any golfer in the tournament. He became only the fifth
Mule golfer in the last 20 years to shoot below a 72.

Freshman Chris DiMaio, who broke in with a 74 on Sunday, slipped to 78 in the second round but still finished with the lowest 36-hole total for Muhlenberg,
tying for fifth place with a 152. Davis was one stroke back, and senior Zachary Oyer finished at 154.

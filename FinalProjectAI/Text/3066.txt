women’s hoops gives bears frostbite





Chili entered the game leading Division III in three-pointers per game. She already ranks ninth on the Mules’ career three-pointers list.


Spectators of the women’s basketball game practically had to ski their way to Memorial Hall. After Muhlenberg’s win 

streak had thawed out with a loss at Alvernia, another cold front picked up in Allentown. While Mother Nature dumped a few inches of snow over the valley, the Mules were creating a blizzard of their own in the gym, plowing their way to an 80-57 victory over Ursinus.

It seemed like a slippery situation, with Muhlenberg facing the team that ruined its chances to host the Centennial Conference playoffs last season. But the Mules shoveled themselves out, falling behind only once early in the first half and freezing the Bears (4-12, 3-8) the rest of the way to win by a chilly 23 points.

Don’t look for the Mules (15-3, 12-0) to melt just yet. With a four-game lead and six games to play, they are close to clinching the CC regular-season championship and homecourt for the CC playoffs. 

“Last year we didn’t get to play at home,” said sophomore Sheila Cook, who had 12 points and led the Mules with three steals in her first start of the year. “It’s important that we win the regular season; it’s always nicer to play on your home court.”

Freshman Alexandra Chili sunk five three-pointers to bring her season total up to 65 and break the school record and CC freshman records for three-pointers in a season. She led the Mules with 29 points.

“We’re all so proud that she broke the record,” said Cook. “And she did it with seven games to go; it takes the pressure off her.

“Opponents have to come out and guard her,” continued Cook. “So it takes the pressure off our guards and our post.”

Chili wasn’t only sinking the snowballs, she was dishing them out, leading the team with four assists. And she was as cool as ice, hitting all eight of her free throws.

Sophomore Kelly McKeon added 12 points for the Mules. Junior Alexis Bates pulled down eight snowboards.

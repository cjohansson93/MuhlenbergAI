A Map is Not the Territory

Ash (2021), terra cotta, copper, sodium bicarbonate

Sandra Eula Lee is a multidisciplinary artist who employs a range of unconventional artistic processes to pose questions about form and materiality. Her works use raw elemental materials, which she transforms through a series of deliberative steps. As if she were performing a science experiment, these materials are combined then burned in kilns, smashed together, or otherwise manipulated into a range of creative artifacts.
Leeâs works have been exhibited internationally, including at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, The Hilliard Museum in Lafayette, LA, Art Space Pool in Seoul, Inside-Out Museum in Beijing, Smack Mellon and Rush Arts Gallery in New York, Goucher College in Baltimore, and Womenâs Studies Research Center at Brandeis University. Recently her work has been featured at The Delaware Contemporary, Ethan Cohen Fine Art KuBE in Beacon, NY and The Border Project Space in Brooklyn. Lee is currently an Andrew Mellon Foundation Fellow and a recipient of the 2020 Individual Artist Award from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation. Sheâs been an Artist-in-Residence at The Elizabeth Foundation Studio Center in New York, The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Seoul Museum of Art, and the Vermont Studio Center among others. Her work has been discussed in The New York Times, Time Out New York, Boston Globe, and Harperâs Bazaar Seoul. Upcoming projects include Philadelphiaâs Cherry Street Pier and The Phillips Museum at Franklin & Marshall College in PA where she runs the Expanded Sculpture program.

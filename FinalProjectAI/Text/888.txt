Welcome. Weâre looking forward to reading your application and getting to know you. If you have questions, be sure to contact admissions.
Regular Decision candidates should complete the Common Application and select Regular Decisions (RD) as their preferred admission plan in the Muhlenberg questions. Our Regular Decision deadline is February 1. Admissions decisions will be sent online to Regular Decisions students by mid-March. Students who are applying to one of our academic partnerships programs must submit additional documents.
Regular Decision applicants may change their application to EDII by submitting the Early Decision Agreement Form through February 15. This option is designed for students, who decide Muhlenberg is their first choice after February 1, to be able to indicate their strong desire to enroll.
Below are directions that we hope will help you in the application process, but as always, we are here to help so please feel invited to contact us with any questions you may have at 484-664-3200.











          Visit if you can.
  








We strongly encourage a campus visit to interview and tour.  The interview can be an important opportunity to explore âthe fitâ between you and Muhlenberg.  It can also be a chance to develop a relationship with an admissions counselor who can then act as an advocate for you here.  Remember, if you are applying for one of our academic partnerships, you are required to have an admissions interview.






          Complete the Common Application by February 1.
  








You may apply online. Note that a $50 application fee is required unless this would present a significant financial hardship for your family or you qualify for an institutional fee waiver. If you have additional questions about our fee waiver policy, please contact us directly at 484-664-3245.






          Have your counselor and one teacher provide recommendations. 
  








Your recommenders can either send their recommendations through the Common Application online or by downloading the forms on the Common Application website and sending them directly to the Office of Admissions.






          Ask your high school counselor to send an official transcript and keep us updated on your academic performance.
  








Your transcript will complete your application, but please be sure that grade reports for each quarter or marking period are sent to Admissions as they become available throughout your senior year. For the Mid Year Report, your counselor can send either through the Common Application online or by downloading the form on the Common Application website and sending it directly to the Office of Admissions.






          If you're choosing to submit your ACT or SAT scores.
  








ACT or SAT scores can be self-reported on your Common Application or you may submit a copy of score reports via email to: admissions@muhlenberg.edu. If you submit scores through any of the testing agencies, Muhlenberg test codes are: SAT, 2424 and ACT, 3640. If you ultimately enroll at Muhlenberg, and you have self-reported your test scores as part of your application, you will be required to submit official test scores from either the test agency or from your counselor.






          If you're choosing not to submit your ACT or SAT scores.
  








Respond accordingly to the preferred testing plan question on the Common Application. You may also indicate this by completing the Test-Optional Form. While test scores are optional for admissions, students must submit test scores to be considered for Academic Partnerships.






          Check for missing application materials and your admissions decision in your application status portal.
  








Once your application is received, you will receive an email with directions on how to access this page. You may access your application status portal here.






          Financial Aid
  








If you wish to be considered for need-based financial aid, please file a FAFSA and Muhlenberg College Scholarship and Aid Application by February 1. If you wish to be considered for merit aid only, you are not required to submit any additional paperwork other than your Common Application.

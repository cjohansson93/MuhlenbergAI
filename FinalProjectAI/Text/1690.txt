General Academic Requirements
The Muhlenberg General Academic Requirements are designed to engage students in thoughtful deliberation, critical analysis, and creative thinking.  The GARs provide students with a balanced education, exposing them to a wide variety of ideas and ways of thinking.  Skills are acquired through courses emphasizing writing, critical thinking, and language proficiency.  A breadth of knowledge â the foundation of a liberal arts education â is achieved through study in each of the four academic divisions: Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences.
In order to graduate from Muhlenberg College, students matriculating at Muhlenberg prior to Summer 2017 will need to complete at least 34 course units, satisfy all general academic requirements, and be certified in a major field of study. 
Students matriculating at Muhlenberg Fall 2017 or later will need to complete at least 32 course units, satisfy all general academic requirements, and be certified in a major field of study in order to graduate.

The Media Services team supports and assists with classroom presentation technologies and computer setup for presentations.
The following services are available:
audio/video presentation set-ups for on-campus locations
classroom technology support and troubleshooting
technology system design and implementation, and
classroom/conference room technology training.
Community members are welcome to use any built-in equipment in public campus spaces. 
In general, we have designed this webpage into sections based on existing user familiarity with Muhlenbergâs Media Services as well as the situation bringing you to our resources.

General Support Information
If you need immediate assistance in a classroom during office hours, please use the Tech Support (black button) phone located on most podiums, or near teaching stations.
In the event that service is required on equipment, immediately contact the OIT Support Desk.
To contact Media Services with other questions, please call x3455 on campus (484-664-3455 if off-campus). Alternatively, you may email the team (media.services@muhlenberg.edu).
For in-person consultation, please refer to this Media Services document related to our hours and means of support.
Media Services relies on student employees to perform many of the duties associated with the department. Students are trained to handle routine requests and basic setups. Student employees with specific training may be available to assist in some special events. In some instances, charges will be incurred for special requests.
For assistance with presentation or event media specifically, the Support Desk is the first point of contact for faculty/staff.  If youâre in need of assistance with a campus club event, students may contact Student Engagement. If ever not certain, you may contact the Media Services team with your requests.
We have routine and special equipment at the college. Both are explored more specifically in this Media Services equipment document. This should be your first reference to consult, as each set requires a different amount of advanced notice to our staff.
You may place a Media Services request via the Media Services request form [this link will take you to a staff log-in area; student requests need to be completed by an advisor]. After your request has been processed, you will receive an automatic confirmation as well as a Google Calendar event request. This will serve as your reminder of your request.
Faculty and staff may place requests for additional technology including rental items. In addition to Routine and Special Equipment Requests, Media Services provides equipment for rental use. Small adapters, cables, video cameras, etc. are available for reservation and pickup upon request. This is to encourage users who prefer a âself-helpâ approach. Walk-ins are welcome. 
For those interested in using other tools within Canvas, such as Zoom, Panopto, etc., please note that our new website will ultimately include areas for the Learning Management System, Collaboration Tools, WebConferencing, etc. so that each set of tools will have its own webpage accessible through the main ITMS website. 
 
I'm new to this
Review the Media Services Equipment Requests and Rules. We have also provided this document of best practices and things to keep in mind when it comes to Media Services requests to assist you during the completion of the form.
We have the following samples: sample Zoom request form, and sample Seegers room request form.
Next, if you are faculty/staff, know that you may submit your requests via this Media Services form.  This form is only for faculty/staff. If your meeting or teaching space does not contain the necessary equipment, please complete the form.
Students need to have an advisor complete the Media Services form. 
All should know that this Media Services form is separate from the requests submitted to the staff in Seegers. That form can be requested through Student Engagement for student events.
If you are not sure whether you need to submit the Media Services form for your needs, we recommend that you still submit the request to Media Services to ensure that you will have your request in consideration in a timely manner.
Most classrooms are furnished with a âTechwallâ system which has a standardized bank of equipment including a computer, Blu-ray player, VHS player, Document camera, and VGA/HDMI auxiliary laptop cables. You may learn more about these classroom technologies in this documentation regarding tech walls here at Muhlenberg.
 
It's a new semester
The tech walls and in-classroom technology is described in this worksheet about tech walls.
Learn about the new touch panels at Muhlenberg in classrooms around campus in this short ITMS video regarding the features and functionality.
Remember to place media service requests as early as possible. The Media Services form does allow placement of requests up to deadline, although we welcome early submissions!
 
I'm stuck/needing help
Please refer to the "general support information" section of this Media Services webpage for more details. 
Have suggestions for additional items for our new Media Services website? Please contact the team at itms@muhlenberg.edu with items you will like included or if something you are seeking is not currently present/available.

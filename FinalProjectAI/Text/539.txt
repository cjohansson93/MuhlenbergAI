Amelia Moreno, lecturer of Spanish, describes the College's observance of the annual celebration, which includes the creation and decoration of an ofrenda, or altar, where the memories of loved ones are displayed. Community members gathered in the College's Seegers Union to create directions before the ofrenda was constructed in Egner Chapel, where it will remain through Tuesday, November 2.

"The idea of this holiday," says Moreno, "is a joyful celebration. "Mexicans do not celebrate the death; they celebrate the life [of the person]."

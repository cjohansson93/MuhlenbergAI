chili named rookie of the year


Freshman Alexandra Chili of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was named Mid-Atlantic Region rookie of the year by D3hoops.com.

Chili led the 26-4 Mules in scoring, averaging 16.0 points per game and hitting double figures in all but five games. In her first collegiate campaign, she broke the school records for points in a season (480)
and three-pointers in a season (96) and tied the mark for three-pointers in a game (9). Chili was third in Division III with her average of 3.2 three-pointers per game; her 96 total three-pointers led the country and were the third-most ever by a 
Division III freshman.

Chili also was second on the team with 118 assists, a school record for
a freshman and a total topped only once in team history prior to this season. She shot a team-best .826 from the foul line, led the team with 44 steals and was second with 17 blocked shots.

Head coach Ron Rohn was named the region’s coach of the year for the second time in four years after leading Muhlenberg to the Centennial Conference
championship and a berth in the NCAA Sweet 16.

FINANCING YOUR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION
Federal and State Sources of Aid

Complete the 2021-2022 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) using your 2019 federal tax return. 

Muhlenberg Collegeâs school code is 003304. This will serve as the needs analysis and will determine eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant, PHEAA PA State Grant, and Federal Student Loans. Additional help with FAFSA questions can be found here. 


Provide additional information if requested. Some students are selected by the federal government for a process called âVerificationâ. If your FAFSA indicates that you have been selected for Verification, you may be required to submit additional information.

Grants
Eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant and Pennsylvania State Grant is estimated according to the information provided on the FAFSA. Grants are based on financial need and do not have to be repaid.  Grants are subject to revision during the year, based upon enrollment changes and academic progress.
Loans
Federal Direct Loans are available to students who have completed the FAFSA and are enrolled at least half-time, or two classes. Interest rates for the student loan program are announced each July 1st. The Subsidized Loan is need-based; the interest is paid by the government while the student in enrolled at least half-time. The Unsubsidized Loan is not need-based; interest begins accruing after disbursement, but can be paid while in school. Interest and principal payments on Direct Loans may be deferred while the student is enrolled at least half-time.
The following loan amounts are available to independent undergraduate students:

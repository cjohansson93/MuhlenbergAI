Build a strong foundation of knowledge
âI was fortunate to take a of a couple of service learning courses (Adolescent Development and Developmental Psychopathology) which helped me put what I was learning into practice. I am grateful for these experiences as they have allowed me to work with various populations.â 
- Kate Weisenseel â17
âYou are more prepared than you think! You are also able to use the base of knowledge to be successful in various areas whether it's completing clinical therapy, research, school counseling, assessments, and more.â 
- Jessica Gonzalez â13
âPsychology and the experiences you have in the major can apply to so many different career paths. When I was an assistant coach, people used to ask me if I felt as though I used my psychology and sport psychology background; my response was that even if I didn't explicitly use my education, it always came out in the foundation of my work.â 
- A.J. Barnold â09 
âThe skills being learned can be applied to so many different types of professions, and career tracks. The psychology major prepares you for both interpersonal relationship building and analytical skills required to make data driven decisions. Having a psychology background doesn't mean you need to become a psychologist, it is a major that helps build a diverse skill set and thoughtful approach to problem solving.â 
- Adam Nodiff â06
âI think there are many avenues to take with a psychology background. Understanding how people work is extremely important in every profession.â
 - Allison Giordano â12

Explore opportunities in and around the community 
âKeep an open mind, explore, research with a faculty member, take classes in all the disciplines within psychology. You will use them all.â
 - Lauren Westendorf â05
âExplore all different ideas, challenge yourself and challenge others.â 
- Douglas Kupferman â08
âI would tell current students to get as involved in the program as they can and seek out opportunities outside of the classroom.â 
- Kate Weisenseel â17
âExplore any internship opportunities that previous psychology majors have done - it's a great way to see what psychology-related work can look like in the âreal worldâ.â 
- Wendy (Eichler) Morrison â05
âI would recommend that current students take advantage of the opportunities available to them. It sounds cliche, but Muhlenberg psychology students are very lucky to have small classes, accessible professors, and opportunities to conduct research.â 
- Jackie (MacFarlane) Bookman â09
âUse this time to explore your interests! Volunteer and do internships and don't be afraid to reach out to a company or someone doing a job you think you might want to pursue. Ask if you can shadow them for a day or even if you can just talk to them about their position and career path. As a student I didn't think anyone I might want to reach out to would agree to this, but I was wrong. Follow your interests and start getting involved in that field.â 
- Victoria Benyo â12

Be open and receptive to change 
âThere is also no rush to figure out exactly what you want to do. Life threw me many curve balls after Muhlenberg, but I wouldnât want it any other way.â 
- Jessica Gonzalez â13
âBe open to learning outside the classroom. Some of my experiences studying abroad and volunteering in Allentown were just as valuable as my classroom experience.â 
- Miles Davison â08
âGrades aren't everything!! ...Follow your interests and be open to new ones! If you do readings that spark an interest, or you keep coming back to the same topics, don't be afraid to "nerd out" and learn more about it. Then, ask your advisor/professors about it and see where it takes you.â 
- Ginelle Wolfe â16
âIt is ok to not know what you want to do after you graduate. Sometimes the best thing to do is identify a particular experience or subject area you liked and learn more about how you can pursue that further. Be sure to keep an open mind as there are many opportunities and resources available that you may not know about.â 
- Laura Winger â10 






          Research
  








Get Involved in Research (even if you may not want to pursue a research career)
âThere are a lot of ways to use the research skills you gain in your time at Muhlenberg.â 
- Nashalys Rodriguez â13
âTake the step of asking faculty member about their research. If it sounds interesting, ask to join their research lab.â 
- Wendy (Eichler) Morrison â05
âI would also advise students not to underestimate the value of the research components of the major. Even in the legal profession, I have encountered studies that I've had to interpret and use in my work. I could not have done that confidently if I hadn't been so immersed in research at Muhlenberg.â
 - Brianna Vinci â15 
 






          Network
  








Engage with those in the Muhlenberg network
âFinally, seek out a mentor. Connect and make time for conversation. Part of the beauty of the Psychology department at Muhlenberg is that the professors love to teach and connect beyond the classroom. To that I am grateful and don't let that part of your education pass you by.â 
- Lauren Westendorf â05
âDon't be afraid to learn from others including your peers.â 
- Nashalys Rodriguez â13
âUse this time to explore your interests! Volunteer and do internships and don't be afraid to reach out to a company or someone doing a job you think you might want to pursue. Ask if you can shadow them for a day or even if you can just talk to them about their position and career path. As a student I didn't think anyone I might want to reach out to would agree to this, but I was wrong. Follow your interests and start getting involved in that field.â

Things I Gained from Studying Psychology at Muhlenberg




"My grad program...places a huge emphasis on multiculturalism and social justice. The education I received in Muhlenberg's psychology department provided me with an extensive background on such topics. The knowledge I gained from my courses allowed me to become more competent when it comes to discussing issues pertaining to multiculturalism, social justice, race and other social identities, oppression/privilege, etc."
-Kate Weisenseel â17




"One of the most important aspects that prepared me for my current work is the countless hours and opportunities that were available to me in the field. I was able to receive various practical experiences in schools and organizations around the Lehigh valley.â
-Jessica Gonzalez â13




"The Muhlenberg psych department's strong emphasis on research through coursework and opportunities to conduct research (with faculty and independently) definitely prepared me for my first graduate program in research methods and career in education research and program evaluation. The critical thinking, analytic, and writing skills that I acquired during my time at Muhlenberg have continued to serve me well over time."
-Jackie (MacFarlane) Bookman â09




"Learning about research methods and statistics was a great foundation for doing more applied research in the real world. Critical thinking, problem solving, and writing skills were also very important. I think the psychology major also teaches you to be more aware of human behavior and that awareness is valuable in many ways."
-Laura Winger â10




"The biggest advantage I got from being at Muhlenberg Psychology was confidence. Being able to work closely with faculty members and in a tighter-knit environment made it easier when first learning how to give presentations and becoming comfortable when sharing my ideas."
-Deborah Ward â10
 



"A big part of my job is managing the employee experience at my current company. That includes a true analysis on why people act a certain way, what things inspire them and thus motivate them, and how we can build connection and find common grounds with a diverse population. Studying psychology and understanding how people work is necessary to be successful in this line of work. It's impossible to manage a workforce if you forget about human emotion and human behavior."

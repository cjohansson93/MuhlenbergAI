Practice prop-building with hands-on instruction in how to make fake food and paper props, and making props out of found objects.
The Basics of Scene Painting

Scene painting allows us to take a set made out of lumber, fabric, or other materials and transform it into the world of the show. Learn the tools of the trade and basic techniques we use in scenic painting. Practice these techniques with hands-on instruction and find out how we paint wood, marble, and brick.
A Bloody Good Time! Blood Workshop

Introduction to Worbla (Thermoplastics)
Instructor: Megan Evans Gartley
Learn how to create your own costume, prop and cosplay pieces made from Worbla. This workshop will teach you the basics of working with Worbla while working on your own sample arm bracer. You'll learn tips and tricks that you can take and apply at home as you become more confident working with thermoplastics. All supplies will be provided. Please wear comfortable fitted clothing and closed toed shoes for safety. It's helpful to have a concept or theme idea prepared for the class as you will be given the opportunity to add detailing to the piece you make and really make it your own.
What is Worbla? It is a thermoplastic material which is non-toxic and skin-safe. With just a heat gun, you can open up the limitless possibilities that Worbla has to offer: It can be shaped by hand to create all types of armor, crowns, helmets, weapons, and other costume pieces which can then be painted.
Workshop limited to 6 participants each afternoon session.

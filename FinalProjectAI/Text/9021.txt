About the Investment Society
Welcome to the Muhlenberg Investment Society homepage!
Founded in 2008, the Muhlenberg Investment Society provides students with hands-on investing experience, discussions regarding the financial markets and guest speakers from the industry.  The Society is open to students that have taken FIN:144 Introduction to Portfolio Finance or by permission from the group or advisor. 
The Muhlenberg Investment Society provides its members with knowledge of investment theory and practice and opportunities to learn in a cooperative environment.
 The group meets on a bi-weekly basis, and is broken up into teams, with each responsible for analyzing and reporting on different sectors of the portfolio.  
The Board of Trustees has provided the Muhlenberg Investment Society with funds to manage on an ongoing basis with assistance from the advisor and other investment professionals. Many students have benefitted from the combination of theory and practical application as they pursue careers in finance and banking.    



We will be holding a meeting this Sunday, October 19th at 4:00PM in Moyer 309

Men's Basketball Beats Haverford for Third Straight Win
 Wednesday, February 13, 2013 -  page 2







					 





Stavetski had a nice all-around game with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists.


Kevin Hargrove usually draws oohs and aahs from the crowd at Memorial Hall for his blocked shots. In the Muhlenberg men’s basketball game against Haverford, however, it was a baseline jumper that got the loudest cheers. 




In addition to his nine points and seven rebounds, junior Brandon Bovino blocked three shots, helping the Mules hold Haverford to 22.6-percent shooting in the second half.



The junior big man showed his range in the second half to help the Mules build a big lead, which they did not squander in winning their second-to-last game of the regular season, 61-51.

The win puts Muhlenberg (15-9, 11-6) into a tie for third place with Johns Hopkins in the Centennial Conference. But since the Blue Jays swept the Mules, Muhlenberg needs to finish ahead of Hopkins to get the third seed in the playoffs and avoid a first-round game. That can happen if the Mules beat Ursinus at home on Saturday and Hopkins loses at home to Washington. A Hopkins win or Muhlenberg loss means a home playoff game for the Mules next Wednesday.

The Mules went on a 12-0 run, which featured two three-pointers by junior Austin Curry, midway through the first half to take a 20-11 lead. Muhlenberg stayed ahead the rest of the half but could not shake the Fords (7-16, 5-12), who own wins against CC co-leaders Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall.

It was 37-30 a little more than seven minutes into the second half when freshman Alec Stavetski drove to the hoop and threw a pass along the baseline to Hargrove, who normally does his scoring around the basket. But Hargrove calmly drained the 10-footer, sparking a 13-4 run that gave Muhlenberg its biggest lead, 49-34, with 6:41 left.

Haverford got to within five, at 54-49, around the two-minute mark, but after Curry made a free throw, Stavetski drew a charge and then made two free throws to help the Mules hold on for their third straight win.

Hargrove finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds for his fifth double-double of the season. Curry ended with 10 points, and his three three-pointers gave him 157 for his career, moving him into second place on the Muhlenberg all-time list. 

Though he only scored seven points, they were enough to give Malique Killing the school record for most points scored by the end of the sophomore season (912). He also pulled down a career-high eight rebounds.

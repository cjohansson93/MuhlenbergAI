baseball seniors sweep in home finale


The Muhlenberg baseball team had many senior moments in its home doubleheader with McDaniel.

No, the players didn’t forget where they left their glasses. In their last appearance at Cedarcreek Field, seniors played prominent roles as the Mules swept McDaniel, 10-9 and 9-7, winning both games in their final at-bat. 

Edward Risener hit the game-winning home run in the first game, and Chris Costa singled in John Kalis with the

winning run in the second. Also in the second game, Mike Misciagna pitched three scoreless innings to earn the win in relief of Brent Morris, who threw a solid first six innings, and Eric Hammond and Christian Conti each had a pair of hits.

Classmates Joseph Barrese and Matthew Ordog did not pitch but joined the seven other seniors and their parents in between games for an on-field ceremony.

Muhlenberg (13-20-1, 7-9) finished its stretch of six Centennial Conference games in four days with a 4-2 record and played spoiler to McDaniel (14-12, 7-8), which came in a game out of fourth place in the CC in the race for the final playoff spot. The Green Terror is now three games out with three to play.

The Mules trailed 6-0 and 9-4 before coming back to win the opener. They scored their first four runs in the bottom of the fourth, with sophomore Eli Branzburg – who caught all 31 innings over the weekend – delivering the big hit, a two-run single.

Down 9-4 entering the bottom of the sixth, Muhlenberg had two runners in and two on when junior Eric Pomroy singled to right. The throw home missed the cutoff man and trickled out of play, allowing both runners to score and sending Pomroy to third, from where he scored the tying run on a wild pitch.

Risener, the next batter, tomahawked a high pitch well over the fence in left-center for his fourth home run of the season.

Junior Phil Cresta pitched a scoreless seventh, ending the game on a double play, to close out his 15th career win. His complete-game effort gave him two wins and a save in four days.

In the second game, it was McDaniel that came from behind. Morris left with a 7-3 lead after six innings, but the Green Terror took advantage of three Mule errors to plate four runs in the top of the seventh.

Kalis led off the bottom of the eighth by reaching on an error. One out later, Conti laced a line drive single to center. Costa, whose error had allowed the tying run to score, redeemed himself by singling to right to bring home Kalis. Conti scored on a groundout.

Misciagna worked a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first win since 2006.

Pomroy drove in three runs in the second game and had four hits in the doubleheader. Branzburg was 5-for-8 in the two games.

Sophomore Bobby Spindler went 3-for-3 in the first game.

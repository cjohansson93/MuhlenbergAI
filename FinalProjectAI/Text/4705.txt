Brewer earns all-region recognition  






The postseason awards keep piling up for junior Ashley Brewer of the Muhlenberg softball team.

Already named Centennial Conference player of the year and selected to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District Team, Brewer (left) was named to the Louisville Slugger All-East Region second team at second base by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.

Brewer led the CC in batting average (.430), on-base percentage (.511) and slugging percentage (.684) and was second in the league in stolen bases (22). She led the Mules with three home runs, three triples, 22 runs scored and 12 walks and was second on the team with 13 RBI. Brewer will enter her senior season tied for the school record for career home runs, with six.

Brewer also had a fantastic season in the circle, going 6-6 with a 3.65 ERA and three shutouts. She held opponents to a .239 batting average, the sixth-best mark in the CC, and struck out 59, eighth in the league. Brewers average of 6.52 strikeouts per seven innings was the second-best single-season mark in Muhlenberg history. In the season opener she pitched the eighth no-hitter in school history.

Brewer is Muhlenbergs second all-region selection in as many years.

Muhlenberg College Public Health Program - 2021 Pennsylvania Health Poll
The following report provides findings from the annual Muhlenberg College Public Health Program Poll of Pennsylvanians on public health issues. This yearâs survey examined topics that included the COVID-19 outbreak and the performance of President Bidenâs handling of the pandemic; health care reform; heroin addiction; immunizations; and marijuana legalization. The survey marks the 9th year of this initiative that is a partnership between the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion and the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program.

Key Findings

Over 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of  Pennsylvanians remain âextremelyâ or âveryâ concerned about the public health situation, yet 6 in 10 agree that the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
As of late March 2021, about 2 out of 3 Pennsylvanians who had not yet received at least one COVID-19 immunization plan to become immunized. However, about 3 in 10 adult residents of the Commonwealth who were not immunized indicated they do not plan to receive the vaccine. Among Pennsylvania Republicans that had not received the vaccine, half (50%) donât plan to ever get immunized.

"Among Pennsylvanians that have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, most plan to become immunized," says Chris Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion. "However a significant portion of unimmunized residents of the state, and particularly those that are registered Republicans, indicate they do not plan to ever receive the vaccine."

A majority (54%) of Pennsylvanians approve of President Joe Bidenâs handling of the pandemic, but opinion is highly divided on Governor Tom Wolfâs work in this area, with 40% approving, and 41% disapproving of Wolfâs performance on this issue.

"While President Biden's handling of the COVID-19 response is generally well-received by Pennsylvanians. Governor Wolf's efforts on this matter produce much more divided reviews by residents of the Commonwealth," says Borick. "A year of crisis governing may have taken a toll on his standing in this key policy area."

A record level (58%) of adult Pennsylvanians support the legalization of marijuana in the Commonwealth, marking the 8th consecutive wave of this survey that support for legalization has increased in the state.

"The trend on public support for legalization of marijuana in Pennsylvania is clear, with support growing for the eighth year in a row," says Borick. "As the state government considers this policy option, the public is increasingly coming to the conclusion that they support legalization."

About 6 out of 10 adult Pennsylvanians (61%) believe it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. 
Just under 1 in 5 adult Pennsylvanians reported that during the past two months they had problems with their work or regular daily activities as a result of emotional problems, such as feeling depressed or anxious


Methodological StatementThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 421 adults in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between March 15 and 29, 2021.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (85) and cell phones (336). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with a smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income and educational attainment to reflect those Pennsylvania population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2020. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult Pennsylvanians, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 6%. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument was designed by Dr. Christopher P. Borick, Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion and Professor in the Public Health Program, in conjunction with students in the Public Health Program at Muhlenberg College. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College. For more detailed information on the methods employed please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

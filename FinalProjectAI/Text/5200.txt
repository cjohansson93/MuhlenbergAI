Chorney, Faust Honored by CC




Muhlenberg senior David Chorney and junior Alex Faust were named track and field athletes of the week by the Centennial Conference for their performances at the Bucknell Outdoor Classic.

Chorney (left) broke the school record in the 5,000 meters, finishing 12th among 26 collegiate runners and beating out eighth Division I athletes in the invitational race. His time of 14:48.02 missed the NCAA provisional mark by three seconds.

Faust broke two school records and qualified for ECACs with the 4x400 relay team. Her pole vault of 12-3½ broke the school and CC mark she set the previous week and matched the best vault in Division III so far this season. She also established a school record in the 400 meters (57.97).





A persistent rain forced the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team to move its Senior Day match against Haverford indoors and cancel the planned exhibition matches
for the three seniors who don’t play in the regular varsity lineup.

Oh well; at least the season is going according to schedule. The Mules defeated the Fords, 8-1, for their fifth straight win since a loss to top-10 ranked Johns Hopkins. Combined with
Washington’s 5-4 loss to Ursinus, the win put Muhlenberg (6-3, 5-1) in sole possession of second place in the Centennial Conference.

The top five players in the lineup all won at both doubles and singles, including two of the honored seniors, Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld. Powell won
7-5, 6-4 at No. 1 singles against a Ford player who came in with a seven-match winning streak and a perfect 6-0 CC record. Rotfeld’s 6-3, 6-3 triumph at No. 3 was
the 39th of her career in spring dual matches, good for a tie for third in team history.

Also notable was an 8-4 victory by the No. 3 doubles team of sophomores Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt, who moved into a tie for second place on the
program’s all-time list with 18 career wins as a pair in spring dual matches.

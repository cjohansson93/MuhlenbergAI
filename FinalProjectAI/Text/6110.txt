Men's Basketball Falls in Championship Game
 Saturday, February 25, 2012 - page 3







					 


The Franklin & Marshall men’s basketball team made some history at the expense of Muhlenberg, becoming the first team in Centennial Conference history to win three straight championships with a 71-55 win in the title game.

But it was a historic and 




Curry's 106 three-pointers are the most ever by a Mule in his first two seasons.



memorable season for the Mules, who finished at 18-9 – their most wins since the 2001-02 squad went 19-6. Muhlenberg closed out the season by winning eight of its last 10 games.

Much of the history centered around senior Spencer Liddic, and he added to his accomplishments in the final game of his career. Liddic recorded his CC-record 46th career double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds, becoming the first Mule in more than 50 years to pull down 300 rebounds in a season. He also broke the CC record for offensive rebounds in a season (117).

Liddic ended his career second on Muhlenberg’s all-time lists in both points (1,707) and rebounds (a CC-record 1,105).

Although he had a rough championship game, Malique Killing broke the CC record for points scored by a freshman (449).  

Behind a pair of three-pointers by sophomore Austin Curry and a pair of emphatic blocked shots by junior Hunter Forsman, the Mules jumped out to a quick 8-2 lead in the title game. It was 18-10 midway through the first half before the 12th-ranked Diplomats (25-2) made three three-pointers to tie the score at 19.

Curry’s floater with 6:58 left gave Muhlenberg its final lead at 23-21. F&M responded with an 8-0 run and went into the locker room with a 33-26 lead.

As they did in making a comeback from a halftime deficit to beat Dickinson in the semifinals, the Mules went to Liddic at the start of the second half. He made four field goals in the first six minutes, but Muhlenberg could not get a defensive stop and never got closer than four points.

A layup by sophomore Kevin Hargrove with 12:31 left made the score 46-40, but the Diplomats reeled off the next 10 points to put the game out of reach.

Curry led Muhlenberg with 17 points, going 5-for-10 from three-point range. Hargrove finished with eight points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots.

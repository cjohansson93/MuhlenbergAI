The Muhlenberg men's and women's cross country teams have been recognized for their efforts in the classroom, as well as on the course.



Both teams earned All-Academic status from the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. 

To qualify for the status, each team must have had a cumulative team grade-point average of 3.10 or better and had at least five runners finish at the NCAA regional championships.
 
With a 3.45 grade-point average, the Muhlenberg men's team tied for 23rd among the 125 teams that earned All-Academic status. The Mules were joined in the top 25 by CC foes Haverford and Swarthmore.

On top of the team accolades, senior Bobby Torphy added yet another award to his already impressive career. 

For the second year in a row, Torphy earned All-Academic honors from the USTFCCCA.

All-Academic honorees must have compiled a cumulative grade-point average of 3.30 or greater during the fall semester and placed in the top 35 at the NCAA regional championships. 

A two-time Academic All-American, Torphy finished a career-best 20th at this past fall's NCAA Mideast Regional, which was good enough for him to earn his second straight trip to the NCAA Championships.

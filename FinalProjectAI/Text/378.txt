Answers:
If I am using a Direct Student Loan, Direct Parent's Plus Loan, or an Alternative Loan to help pay my tuition invoice, will the loan go directly to the college on my account? If you are using a Direct Student Loan, Direct Parent's Plus Loan or an Alternative Loan to pay your tuition invoice, the bank will disburse your loan funds directly to the college. Half of the total loan amount will disburse in the Fall semester and the other half will disburse in the Spring semester. Remember there may be origination fees deducted from the loan.

What are origination fees? Origination fees are bank fees charged for the loan processing of Direct Student Loans and Direct Parent's Plus Loans. The fees can range from 0% to 5% of the total loan amount. Check with your lender regarding these fees. Origination fees are deducted from the total loan amount before the loan is disbursed to the college. You will receive the total loan amount requested less origination fees.
For example, on a Direct Student Loan total of $3,500 and origination fees of 1.05%, you would receive a disbursement of $1,731.62 per semester. Half of the total loan amount is $1,750 less $18.38 in origination fees equals the loan disbursement amount of $1,731.62 per semester.
For a Direct Parent's Plus Loan total of $10,000 and origination fees of 4.2%, you would have a semester disbursement of $4,790. Half of the total loan amount is $5,000 less $210 in origination fees equals the loan disbursement amount of $4,790.

If I have a credit on my account as a result of loan funds, will you refund the credit to me? If a credit is created on your account as a result of a loan disbursement, you will receive a refund. If the credit is created as a result of a Direct Student Loan, the refund will be issued in the studentâs name. If the credit is created as a result of the Direct Parent's Plus Loan, the refund will be issued in the parentâs name. The tuition account must reflect a true credit in order for the refund to be issued.
If you participate in either semester payment plan offered by Nelnet, the refund will not be issued until all tuition payments are paid in full for the semester. â To learn more about the plans and enrolling please see our website at: https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/businessoffice/tuitionpayment/.

Muhlenberg College Monthly Payment Plan The monthly payment plan is a monthly installment plan that enables you to spread your total tuition obligation over as many as five months per semester. The plan is administered Nelnet, to learn more about the monthly payment plan, go to mycollegepaymentplan.com/muhlenberg/ There is an enrollment fee of $45 per semester, and enrollment can be made in either or both semesters. The payment plan can be utilized in addition to loans, grants, and scholarships, etc. Look at your total tuition invoice for a given year and deduct loans, scholarships, grants, or any other 3rd party payment to arrive at the familyâs balance.

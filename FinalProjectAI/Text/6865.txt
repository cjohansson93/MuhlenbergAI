Two Baseball Seniors Reach Milestones


On a day when the bats were mostly quiet for the Muhlenberg baseball team, two seniors made their marks on the record books.

The Mules were swept on Senior Day by Gettysburg, the hottest team in the Centennial Conference, 7-1 and 8-0. Muhlenberg (17-16, 5-9) managed just 11 hits in the
two games against the Bullets (23-10, 9-4), who have won eight in a row and are the only CC team to have beaten Johns Hopkins this year.

Four of the 11 hits came from Joseph Vila, including a double in the first game and a triple in the nightcap. He is now the program’s all-time
leader with 57 career extra-base hits. He moved into third place on the team’s all-time list in both triples (13) and total bases (239).

Vila came around to score his 100th career run after the double, making him the third Muhlenberg player to score 100 runs and drive in 100 runs in his career.

John Muha singled in the third inning of Game 2 to tie the school record of 61 hits in a season.

Vila and Muha were honored along with classmates Robert Appleby, Jimmy Aramanda, Ryan Rechten, Billy Rogers, Rob Shannon and Tim Velys between games of the doubleheader. Rogers pitched a scoreless ninth in Game 1, and Aramanda had a single in Game 2.

Sophomore Craig Welker had the highest finish for the men, coming in fourth in the 10,000.



A trio of athletes on the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team found success in “new” events at the Greyhound Invitational, hosted by Moravian.

Senior Erica Bash, competing in the steeplechase for just the second time, finished in first place with an ECAC-qualifying time of
11:44.20, which moved her into second place on the Mules’ all-time performance list. 

In the third time competing in the 400 intermediate hurdles in her career, senior Tara Keegan knocked nearly three seconds off her time, 
running a 1:10.00 to land in fifth place on the performance list. In the same event, freshman Katrina Faust clocked in at 1:10.54, good for
seventh place on the performance list. It was her first time running the 400 hurdles in her life.

Katrina Faust’s older sister, senior Colette Faust, tied her personal best and qualified for ECACs in the high jump, coming in 
second at 5-2¼. 

Juniors Stephanie Carnevale and Amber Lee Wojtkowski both ran ECAC-qualifying times in the high hurdles, with Carnevale 
finishing fourth (first among Division III runners) and missing the school record by two hundredths of a second.

Freshman Claire Thornton (10th in the 800 meters) and Melanie Tramontina (eighth in the 5,000 meters) also ran times that
made the program’s all-time performance list.

For the men’s team, senior Ryan Hellings set a personal best in the pole vault, tying for eighth at 13-7¼ and vaulting from sixth to fourth on the performance list.

The Mules also got a significant performance from a member of their coaching staff, as throws coach and 2016 Olympic hopeful Andy Fahringer won the javelin with a distance of 254-2 –
the second-best throw in the country this year.

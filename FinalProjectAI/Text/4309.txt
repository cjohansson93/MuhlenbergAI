Rosen joins century club as women's lacrosse crusies


It did not take senior Danielle Rosen long to make the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse teams Spring Break a memorable one.

Rosen became just the 10th player in school history to score 100 career goals as she helped the Mules ease past Misericordia, 15-3, in Hilton Head, S.C.




Napoletanos five goals and six points were both career highs.



Its funny because I didnt realize it was going to be my 100th goal until it was mentioned after the last game, Rosen said. Im really proud of it; its a great accomplishment. But I could never have gotten to 100 goals without the support of my teammates on and off the field, so this is as much for them as it is for me.

Senior Christine Van Hise scored less than a minute into the game to help Muhlenberg rush out to a quick 6-0 lead. 

After Misericordia (0-1) finally found the back of the net, the Mules (2-0) reeled off five more goals in a row, including three straight from junior Angela Napoletano, to grab a commanding 12-2 lead at the break.

Rosen scored all four of her goals in the first half to bring her career total to 102, just two goals away from ninth place on the Mule all-time scoring list.

With its comfortable halftime cushion, Rosen said Muhlenberg focused on keeping possession and controlling play during the second half.

The Cougars were only able to muster two shots during the final 30 minutes as Mule goalie Allisyn Vachon allowed three goals or less for the fourth time in her career.

Napoletano led the offense with five goals and an assist, while Van Hise and sophomore Molly Davin contributed two goals apiece. Junior Kelsey Elmer dished out two assists.

Senior Maggie Sullivan recorded seven ground balls, and junior Jessica Shegoski controlled four draws to lead the Mules.

While Rosen said getting the win and the milestone was great, she was more focused on using the trip to help build team cohesion. She said Spring Break is a chance for the Mules to lay the foundation for a successful season while enjoying the beautiful South Carolina sunshine.

This is such a great bonding experience; I look forward to it every year, Rosen said. We get a new group of girls each year and this trip helps bring us together. Were all really good friends off the field, so this is a chance for us to spend every waking hour together, which is pretty cool since we get to go to the beach.

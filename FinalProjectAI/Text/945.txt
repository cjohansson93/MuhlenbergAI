Integrative Learning at Muhlenberg
Integrative learning enables students to make connections that combine and explore different perspectives. Integrative learning applies multiple ways of knowing to concepts and experiencesâand empowers participants to recognize and solve problems, address existing questions and ask new ones in more comprehensive ways.
At Muhlenberg, we donât expect students to master integrative learning. After all, itâs a mindset and way of learning that constantly develops and is honed in many ways throughout an individualâs lifetime. An effective integrative learning experience will:

Teach how to incorporate and integrate at least two different perspectives. The pairing of these perspectives should be sustained throughout the entire learning period.
Require a critical, active reflection of how students learn and understand throughout the experience.
At a minimum, be sustained over the course of an academic semester.

This type of learning is designed to be intentional, sustained and reflective. And, importantly, integrative learning should expand beyond the walls of the laboratory or classroomâthis type of knowledge often flourishes in linked or co-taught courses as well as through lectures, performances and exhibits. Integrative learning is well-suited to Muhlenbergâs MILA global education programs, community-engaged research and scholarship and through participation in alternative spring breaks and peer mentorship opportunities.
As a core component of Muhlenbergâs curriculum, integrative learning provides a method for intentionally cultivating this powerful way of thinking in collaborative environments and communities.

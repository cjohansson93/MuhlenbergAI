What is the Multicultural Center?
The Multicultural Center at Muhlenberg College is a constant brave space for the purposes of support, education, networking, and sanctuary.  It houses the offices of OML professional and student staff, as well as hosts programming and resources to increase cultural awareness.
The Multicultural Center was formally established in 2007 under the leadership of Dr. Ethel Drayton-Craig, who served as its first director.  At that time it was situated under the Office of the Provost.  In 2009, OML and the Multicultural Center became part of the portfolio of the Dean of Students under the Division of Student Affairs. 
Multicultural Center Functions
The Center is a college-owned facility established for the designated use of groups historically targeted and marginalized within U.S. society.  They provide an opportunity for students to retreat from environments which may be alienating at times.  It also serves an educational function by providing programming relevant to historically targeted groups and their allies. 
This programming allows students to explore their own identities and develop leadership skills.  The Center may be reserved by members of the Muhlenberg community for college-related functions including public lectures, special receptions, or other large group gatherings.  The Center may also be reserved for small group meetings.

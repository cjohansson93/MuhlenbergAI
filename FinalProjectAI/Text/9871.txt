Diverse. Innovative. Boundary-breaking. World-Class.
That's the Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance Mainstage series. Dance performances from intimate contemporary solos to grand-scale ballet, theatre productions from experimental blackbox to Broadway-style musicals â all delivered with the sophistication and vision of a professional repertory company.
Muhlenberg's Mainstage represents opportunity, for patrons and for the students of the Theatre & Dance Department: a vibrant and rambunctous performing arts experience for participants and audiences alike.
And that's just the half of it! Muhlenberg offers extensive performance opportunities beyond the Mainstage, including student-choreographed Dance Gallery productions, touring dance ensembles, a wealth of theatre performances, and a lot more!

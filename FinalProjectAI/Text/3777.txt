Men's soccer cruises past Marywood 


For more than 25 minutes Muhlenberg soccer forward Mike Williams waited for an opportunity to make an aggressive run at the Marywood goal.

And when Cody Antonini slipped a pass through the Pacer defense and hit Williams in stride, the Muhlenberg senior seized his opportunity. With one dribble, Williams controlled the pass and calmly buried it into the far corner of the net.




Luginbuhl (14) notched the first goal of his career with less than a minute to play before halftime.






Williamsâ goal opened the floodgates for the Mule offense, as Muhlenberg added four more goals to roll past Marywood, 5-0, at Varsity Field.

âWe know what weâre supposed to do and if it doesnât work out the first couple of times, we know if we keep at it and keep pounding it in there that itâs going to work out eventually,â Williams said. âOnce we got the first one we just ran after that.â 

While Antonini assisted on Williamsâ goal, the junior midfielder added a pair of his own.

In the 41st minute Antonini rushed in from the left edge. He calmly beat a pair of defenders with a hesitation move and light dribble before beating the goalkeeper from six yards out.

âHeâs fantastic, heâs a great player,â Williams said of Antonini. âAll he needs is a little bit of space and heâs dangerous. So hopefully he can keep scoring goals like he did last year and help carry us.â

Josh Luginbuhl completed the first-half scoring when he connected off of a Tim Leischner corner kick, giving Muhlenberg a 3-0 halftime lead.

But the Mules (1-0) were not finished as Antonini, the reigning Centennial Conference player of the year, once again beat a pair of defenders before rifling a shot from 25 yards out past the diving goalkeeper into the lower right corner of the goal.

Antoniniâs five points on the day tied a career high. He also notched a pair of goals and an assist against Moravian last fall.

Finally, sophomore Kenn Andersen, playing in just the second game of his career, ended the scoring when he beat the keeper to a free ball and chipped it into the wide-open net with less than two minutes remaining.




Antonini picked up where he left off in 2009, tallying a pair of goals and an assist.





It may not have been as artistic as he had hoped for his first goal, but Andersen said he would gladly take it nonetheless.

âAs a forward you make that run about 1,000 times and it never works, but I just got lucky this time that it actually did work,â Andersen said. âEverybody dreams of their first goal being some amazing goal from the outside, but Iâll take anything I can get.â

With the Mule offense scoring often, the defense kept Marywood (1-1) at bay. Muhlenberg only allowed a pair of Pacer shots, and neither one got to Mule goalkeeper Jason Daniels.

It was a very workman-like effort for the Mules, who were able to play get 23 players into the game, including five freshmen.

And while Williams said he was pleased with the effort for the season opener, he also added it was just the first step in what he hopes to be a long, successful season.

âWe expected to come out and get a âW,ââ he said. âWe donât expect anyone to be able to beat us on our home field and take a lot of pride in not losing here a lot. Our goal is we donât want to lose here this year, so to win 5-0 in the first game is a great feeling.â

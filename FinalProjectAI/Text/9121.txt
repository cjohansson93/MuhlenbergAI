Winter 2021 - National Surveys on Energy & Environment
The following key findings and full report are from the Winter 2021 wave of the National Surveys on Energy and Environment (NSEE). This survey wave marks the 24th in the series, dating back to the projectâs origin in 2008, under a partnership between Muhlenberg College and the University of Michigan. Beginning in 2020, the NSEE has been produced exclusively by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.

KEY FINDINGS


American acceptance of global warming remains at a record high level.
The Winter 2021 NSEE results show 75% of adult Americans believe there is solid evidence that temperatures on the planet have risen over the last four decades. This 75% level is identical to the Summer 2021 NSEE result that established the highest level of acceptance since the project began in 2008. The most recent survey marks the 9th consecutive survey wave, dating back to 2016, in which at least 70% of Americans indicated there was solid evidence of global warming. This consistently high level of acceptance of climate change suggests Americans have arrived at a more durable position in terms of views on the existence of this challenge.


 


In addition to record-high acceptance of climate change, Americans have become more confident in their view that the planet is warming.
As acceptance of climate change has reached record levels in the United States over the last year, confidence in these appraisals has also reached record levels. In the most recent NSEE wave, over half of American adults indicated that they are âvery confidentâ that global warming is happening. The 51% indicating that they are very confident global warming is occurring is the highest level recorded since the NSEE first measured this aspect of opinion on climate change in the fall of 2010.


 


Wide acceptance of human roles in causing global warming
Nearly 6 in 10 adult Americans indicate that there is strong evidence of global warming and that humans are at least partially responsible for this phenomenon. In February, 38% of Americans indicated that there is solid evidence of a warming planet and that the warming is caused primarily by human activity. An additional 19% of Americans agreed there is solid evidence of global warming, and that humans are at least partially responsible for these changes. While a majority (57%) of Americans believe humans are contributing to increased temperatures on earth, 16% indicate that while there is solid evidence of global warming, the warming is the result of a natural cycle.


 


Most Americans attribute 2020âs record warmth to broader effects of global warming.
In early 2021, NASA released a report that indicated 2020 was tied with 2016 as the hottest year on the planet since record keeping began in 1880. The NSEE included a question that examined American reactions to this finding. The survey results show about half (47%) of Americans indicated the findings of record heat in the NASA report was evidence of human-induced global warming, with an additional quarter (24%) saying the record heat was a sign of global warming, but that the heating was caused primarily by a natural cycle. Only 13% of Americans indicated the NASA finding was based on flawed measurement and that global warming was not happening. 


 
 


Americans have varied views on the most important elements of climate policy, with mitigation efforts most commonly identified, but significant portions prioritize adaptation and geoengineering.
The Winter 2021 NSEE included a question asking Americans what type of actions are most important for the United States to take to address climate change. About 4 in 10 (39%) selected policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions as the most important policy approach. Fairly equal numbers of adult Americans indicated policies to adapt to a warmer world (16%) or promote geoengineering to counter climate change (17%) as their preferred priority for the nation.



METHODSThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 614 adult residents of the United States between February 4 and 20, 2021. Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (111) and cell phones (503). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with a smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. Interviewing was conducted by Communication Concepts of Easton, Pennsylvania, under protocols established by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO). The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income and educational attainment to reflect national population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2020. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult residents of the United States, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 7%. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument, presented in its entirety in the following section, was designed by Dr. Christopher P. Borick, Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, and Professor of Political Science, in conjunction with Dr. Barry Rabe of the University of Michigan, and Dr. Erick Lachapelle of the University of Montreal. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

Muhlenberg College GIS ~Exploring the World~


What is a GIS? A geographic information system (GIS) is a tool used to map and analyze objects.  It assembles, stores, manipulates and displays geographically referenced information.
How does it work? A GIS retrieves maps and other data which are then stored or filed as layers of information.
Why use it? GIS technology enables complex analyses to be made about the spatial properties and potential relationships of objects and events.  It integrates the benefits offered by both database operations and those offered by the visual perspective of maps.

Field Hockey Spreads the Wealth in Home Win
 Friday, September 12, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg field hockey team is not afraid to spread the wealth in 2014. The Mules’ 5-1 win over Drew was case in point, with five different players supplying a goal.

“We really look to spread it around,” said senior Kayleigh Thies, who notched her first goal and assist of the season, tying her for ninth all time in goals (28) and fifth in points (76) in program history. “If teams focus in on one person, we are not going to lose, because we have other people who can score.”



Four of the five goal scorers on the night were seniors, starting with Samantha Swire in the fourth minute. Lauren Jordan, who assisted on the first goal, put away her third of the season 10 minutes later off a corner, with a helper from Thies. To round out the first half, Thies (left) ripped a goal of her own from the top of the circle off a corner from Swire, giving Muhlenberg a 3-0 lead.

After a quick Drew score to start the half, Christine Germaske had her first goal of the year waiting for her in front of the cage to put the game away for good in the 62nd minute.  Not to be outdone by Jordan, sophomore Emily Boyle picked up her third goal in as many games in the 67th minute. 

The dominant win makes the 6-1 loss last year to Drew a distant memory for the Mules, who have avenged both of their 6-1 losses from last fall. Muhlenberg improved to 3-1 on the season, an impressive record considering its four opponents combined for a .783 winning percentage in 2013.

“Our confidence is sky high,” said Boyle. “We are really enjoying playing as a team and you can see it on the field.”

With conference play only a week away, Thies is excited about where the team is.

“We want to win a conference championship,” said the 2013 All-American, “We put a competitive schedule in so we can test ourselves out. The fact that we are crushing it during this opening stretch is just great for conference play.”

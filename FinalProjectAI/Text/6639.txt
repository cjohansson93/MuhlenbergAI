Two seniors on the Muhlenberg wrestling team, Matt Parker and Chris Galletta, came within one win of placing at the Messiah
Petrofes Invitational.

At 149, Parker (left) won two consolation bouts by decision after dropping his opening match to the fifth-seeded wrestler. He lost by major decision to another seeded
opponent in the consolation quarterfinals. Parker leads the team in wins with a 4-3 record.

Galletta, wrestling for the Mules for the first time since his freshman season, scored a 5-2 decision in the consolation bracket in between two losses by major decision
to seeded wrestlers.

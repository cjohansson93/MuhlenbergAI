grand finale for softball in playoff game



Women’s Tennis Drops Playoff Match


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team lost to Washington, 5-3, in the semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The site (Perring Athletic Club outside Baltimore) was different than when the two teams played at Muhlenberg last week, but the results were 
remarkably similar. Each team won at the same spots, except for No. 1 singles, which was stopped in the third set once the match was decided. The scores
at second through fourth singles were almost identical.

The Mules’ singles wins came from senior Carly Rotfeld and sophomore Sara Sutker, who both finished the season with 11-match
winning streaks. Rotfeld won 6-0, 6-0 in her final match, ending her career with an overall combined record of 91-52. Sutker’s 24 combined wins
during the spring dual-match season tied for the second most in program history.

Muhlenberg won 10 of its last 13 matches, with the only losses coming to the two CC finalists (Johns Hopkins and Washington).

seventh to give the Mules an 8-5 win against Gettysburg in the first game of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Mules (19-16) lost to Haverford, 8-2, in their second game, however, and will need three wins on Sunday to claim the CC championship. They face Gettysburg in an elimination game in the morning, with the winner going on to play Haverford.

Muhlenberg trailed Gettysburg 3-1 before sophomore Ashley Brewer belted a two-run homer in the bottom of the fifth. The Bullets plated single runs in the sixth and seventh to take a 5-3 lead.

With one out in the bottom of the seventh, junior Jenna Van Waalwijk began the winning rally with a single. Three more singles – by Brewer, senior RiRi Ferrigno and freshman Maggie Scarpelli - cut the deficit to one run.

Crist stepped up to the plate next and drove an 0-1 pitch over the fence in right-center for the walkoff slam.

Van Waalwijk gave Muhlenberg an early lead with a first-inning home run in the second game, but Haverford scored runs in the second and third, then blew the game open with a four-run fourth.

Brewer hit her second home run of the day in the top of the fifth, giving Muhlenberg a school-record 11 round-trippers on the season.

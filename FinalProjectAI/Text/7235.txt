Men's Lacrosse Picks Up First Win of Season
 Wednesday, February 26, 2014 - page 3







					 






Junior Austin Akner put the Mules on the board by scoring a goal for the second straight game with 6:17 left in the first quarter.
He came into the season with a career total of one goal.


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team overcame bitter cold and three one-goal deficits to defeat Susquehanna, 6-4, for its first victory of the 2014 season.

Senior Tom Glancy scored three goals for his fourth career hat trick, and junior Adam Schlauch stopped 11 shots while allowing only four goals.

Playing against a Crusader squad that qualified for the NCAA Tournament last year, the Mules (1-2) fell behind 1-0 in the first, 2-1 in the second and 3-2 in the third. Each time they scored the equalizer before the end of the quarter, and the teams went into the final 15 minutes deadlocked.

Freshman Elliot Dennis broke the tie and gave Muhlenberg its first lead of the game when he buried a feed from junior Michael Heenan 1:41 into the fourth quarter. Four minutes later, sophomore Steven Casella scored off a pass from junior Pat Farrell to make the margin two goals for the first time in the game.

Susquehanna (1-1) made things interesting by scoring with 2:49 to play but never had possession with a chance to tie. The Mules won the ensuing faceoff and got an insurance goal from Glancy, assisted by senior Casey Gill, with 1:40 to play.

Schlauch made five of his 11 saves in the fourth quarter and also picked up nine ground balls. Dennis was 8-for-12 on faceoffs.

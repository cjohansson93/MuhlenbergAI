Men's Tennis Strong at Season-Opening Tournament
 Sunday, September 9, 2012 - page 2







					 





With just a few days of practice behind them, the players on the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team opened their season on a positive note at the Mule Fall Classic.

The field this year included New York Institute of Technology, a Division II squad coached by former Mule football player Christopher Frusci ’08 that earned a 
bid to the NCAA Tournament this past spring.

The top five players in Muhlenberg’s singles lineup and the top two doubles teams went undefeated against the other Division III schools, Wilkes and Moravian.

Sophomore Daniel Lakhman (left) won the first singles flight, defeating a replacement NYIT player in the final. Freshman Max
Blumenthal (right) at No. 2, junior Ben Berkowitz at No. 4 and sophomore Eric Chavis at No. 5 all reached the
finals before falling to NYIT foes, with Berkowitz taking his opponent to a third set. Junior Jason Teitelbaum dropped his first match to an NYIT
player but won the third-place match, 6-1, 6-0.

The top two doubles teams played tight, competitive matches against NYIT twosomes, with Blumenthal and Teitelbaum falling 8-6 in the first round and Lakhman and Chavis
losing by the same score in the final.

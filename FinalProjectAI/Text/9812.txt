Dual Majors & Multidisciplinary Studies
One of the hallmarks of the Department is the chance to pursue other academic interests in addition to intensive theatre and dance training. As a result, we have attracted a community of students with incredibly diverse interests, experience, and talents.

The Theatre & Dance curriculum is designed to be both rigorous and flexible, allowing you to pursue your interests in multiple performing arts disciplines or in other fields of study entirely. The majority of our students take at least a minor in addition to their dance major, or select more than one concentration within dance (for example, performance and education).
One of Muhlenberg's great advantages is the personal attention of your academic advisor, who will help you carefully plan your coursework to fulfill your academic goals and requirements. Talk to your advisor about your plans and ambitions, and he or she will help you figure out how to achieve them.
Here are just some of the multidisciplinary options available to you.

Musical Theatre studies Muhlenberg provides excellent training to students with an interest in musical theatre performance. Students typically combine training in our Dance and Theatre programs with courses in Muhlenberg's excellent Music Department. Find out more about musical theatre training.
Arts Administration The Business Program offers an Arts Administration concentration as an option within the business major. Many students combine this concentration with studies in dance â great preparation for a career behind-the-scenes in the performing arts, or for running a performing arts-related business, such as a dance company or studio.
Arts Education Students interested in teaching the performing arts often take courses in theatre and dance while pursuing certification through the College's Education Program. Education courses will also benefit those interested in operating a dance studio or performing for children. Many students interested in teaching the performing arts join the teaching staff of the Muhlenberg Community Dance Center youth programs.
Dance & Science Many of our Dance Science concentration students will take a second major in their scientific discipline of choice â frequently biology or neuroscience.

Many other students pursue completely unrelated academic interests, ranging from mathematics to pre-law. Remember that all Muhlenberg students are welcome to take courses in the Theatre & Dance Department, regardless of their major â so if you want to continue to explore the performing arts while you prepare for your medical career, you should do it!
Take a look at the College Course Catalog. Courses and requirements for the Dance major and minor can be found here.

Women's Soccer Falls to Moravian
 Thursday, October 13, 2011







					 



Playing the middle game in a stretch of three games in four days, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team could not hang on to a 2-0 lead and lost at Moravian,
3-2.

The Mules (6-6-2) dented the scoreboard in the 29th minute when sophomore Stephanie Tramutola scored her second goal of the season on a high free kick
that dipped just under the crossbar as it crossed the goal line.

A little more than two minutes later, freshman Colleen Touhey intercepted a Greyhound clearing pass and fired a long shot into the upper right
corner of the net. It was the second career goal for Touhey (right), who scored her first yesterday in a 3-0 win against Bryn Mawr.

Moravian (5-8-1) cut the gap in half with 8:20 left in the first half, then scored twice in the second half.

The result evened the Matte Award standings for the 2011-12 year at 2-2. The next scheduled Matte contest is a field hockey game at Moravian on October 25.

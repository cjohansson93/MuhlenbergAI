Traci Hilbert  â
 Administrative Assistant Trumbower Science Building  (484) 664-3299 Fax: (484) 664-3546

Background
I graduated from Drew University with majors in art and anthropology and a handful of undeclared minors. While that doesn't contribute directly to a admin position in math/CS & physics, I truly believe one of the core values of a liberal arts education is that you can adapt to all types of environments and continually learn new things.
I currently live in Easton with a portable can crusher, paper shredder, and dishwasher pre-rinse cycle cleverly disguised as a large dog.

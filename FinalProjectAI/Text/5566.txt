cresta adds to string of zeroes


How does a team win when scoring four runs and lose when scoring 12? Pitching. And when sophomore Phil Cresta is on the mound, the Muhlenberg baseball team knows it can count on good pitching.

Cresta blanked his opponent for the third consecutive start, throwing six shutout innings in the

Muhlenberg finished its home season with a doubleheader loss at the hands of McDaniel, 4-1 and 7-6.

In the second game, the Mules (6-26, 2-10) knocked out the Green Terror’s starting pitcher in the first inning and led 6-3 after three, but the visitors rallied for the win.

Junior RiRi Ferrigno went 
4-for-4 in the second game, and freshman Jess Kasza had five hits in the twinbill.

Katie Vecchione, one of two seniors honored between games, pitched a 
complete game and struck out six in the opener.

story, as the Green Terror scored 17 runs in the last two innings for a 23-12 victory.

The split left Muhlenberg (18-14, 9-7) one game ahead of both Ursinus and Gettysburg in the race for the fourth and final Centennial Conference playoff spot with two games remaining in the regular season. The Mules, who close out with a home doubleheader against ninth-place Washington next Saturday, have some tiebreaker advantages, as they swept Gettysburg and own a win against regular-season champion Johns Hopkins.

They also have the advantage of the hottest pitcher in the CC. In the last eight days, Cresta has allowed no runs and eight hits in 20 innings. He economized his pitches against vs. McDaniel, throwing only 65 in his six-inning sting. Senior Paul Faith worked the seventh to complete the shutout. 

Cresta’s scoreless streak of 20 1/3 innings is just shy of the school record of 22. He is only the fourth pitcher in team history to win seven games in a season.

Backing the fine pitching in the first game was another player who is familiar with the record book, junior Christian Conti. He tied a 28-year-old school record by slamming his ninth home run of the season in the third inning. Muhlenberg’s other two runs came on back-to-back RBI hits by freshman Bobby Spindler and sophomore Dan Fisher against the CC leader in ERA.

The Mules appeared well on their way to a sweep when they scored three runs in the top of the seventh inning of the second game to take a 12-6 lead. But McDaniel scored 11 in the bottom of the seventh and six more the following inning.

Fisher and junior Eric Hammond had three hits apiece in the nightcap. Fisher’s triple in the seventh was the school-record 25th of the season for Muhlenberg. Hammond set a school record with his seventh sacrifice of the season, a suicide squeeze in the fourth.

Conti hit a three-run double in the second to surpass the 50-RBI mark for the campaign.

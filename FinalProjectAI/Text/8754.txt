Open Path Collective -  During these challenging times, we remain dedicated to connecting clients with therapists offering affordable care. Many of our therapists are transitioning to online sessions until this crisis passes (and still, there are some that will work with you, in-person).  To search for online therapy, look for the online therapy option in the left sidebar. Then, choose your state. You will then see a list of therapists who are licensed in your state to work online with you.

Muhlenberg College - campus resource page:https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/counseling/informationforstudents/self-helpforstudents/usefullinks/
Psychology Today - search for local providers and filter by insurance, zip code, etc. Online: www.pyschologytoday.com
Virtual Therapy Tools - there are many online resources available at this time to find a therapist online.  There are also many virtual tools including applications to support mindful action.

Insurance - Most insurance plans include behavioral health as part of the benefits. Be sure to check with your insurance provider that behavioral health is included and if you have an individual/family deductible you need to meet. You may also want to familiarize yourself with the out-of-network policy in case the provider you choose is out-of-network. During the pandemic, some insurance companies have temporarily waived copays for behavioral health visits. 
To Find a Therapist Through Insurance: Call the number on the back of your insurance card to hear a list of providers in your area. Alternatively, visit your insurance networkâs website to obtain a more comprehensive list. Call or send an email to the provider youâre looking to work with to check their availability as well as if they are accepting new clients. 
Internet Search: Open search engine and type âMental Health + zip codeâ or âCounselor + Zip code + specialityâ for example: âTherapist + 18045 + anxietyâ. Visiting their profiles or websites can give you an idea of what type of therapy they offer and see if theyâd be a good fit. Most providers offer a free 10 minute consultation where you can ask questions to gauge your own comfortability such as âWhat types of concerns/issues do you treat?â âWhat does a typical session look like?â âWhatâs your approach?â Most providers are practicing telehealth right now so be prepared to start with your therapist virtually instead of in person.

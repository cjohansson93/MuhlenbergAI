Event Schedules
Baccalaureate will be held Thursday, May 17, 2018 at 8:30 p.m. This service lasts approximately one hour.
Commencement will be held Friday, May 18, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. This ceremony lasts between two and three hours. Visitors are encouraged to arrive early for an outdoor ceremony, as general seating cannot be reserved.
Inclement Weather
Due to space limitations and safety concerns, each student will receive three rain tickets for both Baccalaureate and Commencement. If either service is held outside, no tickets are needed, and graduates may invite as many guests as they wish.
A Baccalaureate weather decision will be made prior to 6:00 p.m. on Thursday. Graduates, faculty and staff will be notified via text and email, and public announcements will be made via social media only if the ceremony is moved indoors.
A Commencement weather decision will be made prior to 6:00 a.m. on Friday. Graduates, faculty and staff will be notified via text and email, and public announcements will be made via social media only if the ceremony is moved indoors.
 
Online Video
Muhlenberg offers a live stream of our discussions with honorary degree recipients and the Baccalaureate and Commencement ceremonies. Video streams will begin approximately shortly before the start of each event.
Events will also be streamed on campus in several locations: 

Seegers Union (Light Lounge and Red Door Cafe)
Trumbower Hall (Lithgow Auditorium)
Moyer Hall (all first-floor classrooms and Miller Forum)

A campus map is available for those unfamiliar with Muhlenberg's buildings and grounds.
About the 2018 Honorary Degree Recipients

Ali Mctar, English Consortium for Faculty Diversity FellowMctar grew up on the far southern border of California. He majored in critical theory at Williams College, where he arrived wanting to study history and political science and left wanting to be an English professor and work on critiques of the law, mostly in poetry. After college, he spent a year living in Quaker communities in Rwanda, South Africa and Nepal to learn how international Friends lived out their peace testimony in countries with histories of conflict. After that, in 2015, he moved to Princeton for a Ph.D. under Nigel Smith, where he studied early modern literature and Antinomianism, which is to say a version of Christian anarchism and its literary off-shoots, particularly in John Miltonâs prose and poetry, and especially in Paradise Lost. His work takes seriously the possibility that there exists forms of morality that donât describe their commitments as laws, as well as modes of social life not governed by legal codes, courts or enforcers, and that literature often summons us to this life outside the law.

 
Tiffany Montoya, Philosophy Consortium for Faculty Diversity Fellow Montoya received her Ph.D. in philosophy from Purdue University, and a B.A. in philosophy and English from the University of New Mexico. She specializes in social and political philosophy, ethics and philosophy of race, but is also trained in the methodological traditions of 19th- and 20th-century continental philosophy. Her current research involves investigating and critiquing the presupposed assumptions of human ontology within capitalism and liberalism, as well as analyzing how these assumptions can lead to an array of ethical problems (from environmental destruction to the diminished health and well-being of underprivileged populations). She is working on creating/uncovering a new ontological foundation (i.e. philosophical anthropology) from which we can build a more ethically based political economy. Her goals for teaching are to create better citizens and humans who can think critically about complex social/political and ethical issues, who have the courage to reflect on their own presuppositions and who can connect more fully with their own humanity and that of others.

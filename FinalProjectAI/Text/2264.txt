In Giovanni Boccaccio's medieval classic âThe Decameron,â ten friends live through the last moments of a horrific plague year by retreating to a rural estate for ten days and telling each other stories about intimacy and politics. 
Flash forward 670 years to another pandemic. Ten Muhlenberg College performers have retreated to Zoom for a ten-day rehearsal period to create â10x10 (or, The Decameron),â â a nuanced conversation on what they care about most at this historic (yet tedious) moment.
âAll our stories definitely delve into the idea of personal vs universal,â says company member Celeste Samson. âThere are some that are addressing societal issues and some bring up personal things. On a broad scale, these stories collectively are about being together in whatever way we can when times are hard.â
Theatre faculty member Ethan Philbrick directs this 21st century response to Boccaccio â not really an adaptation, he says; âThe Decameronâ is more of a template for the project than a script. 
âWeâre using medieval text as source material, but not as a script to performâ Philbrick says. âWeâre using the central premise and structure â not to bring the Middle Ages to life, but to pay attention to the resonances between the 14th century and the 21st.â
With funky modern visuals by artist Lauryn Siegel, the play will premiere April 22-23, streaming live over Zoom, as part of Muhlenbergâs Mnemonic Theatre Festival.
Philbrick hopes the Zoom medium will be an excellent modality to reflect on the losses, challenges, and resilience of the past year. 
âZoom comes out of a problem, this is a very difficult time to make theatre, with all of the losses from the COVID-19 pandemic,â he says. âLosses of life. Loss of community. Performance is the mode of artistic expression that weâve lost the most, and that we will keep losing. Weâve risen to the challenge of making performance online and exploring digital performance, and mediums like Zoom.â 
Muhlenbergâs mostly-virtual Mnemonic Theatre Festival continues through May. Information on all seven productions in the festival is available at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow
â10x10 (or, The Decameron)â plays Thursday and Friday, April 22-23, at 8 p.m. Eastern time. Admission is free, and performances take place online. Patrons can request free tickets at muhlenberg.edu/seeashow.

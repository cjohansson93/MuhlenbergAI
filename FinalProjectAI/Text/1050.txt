Gender Inclusive Housing


Gender Inclusive Housing â Upperclass students Gender inclusive housing options are available in all upper class housing with the exception of Brown Hall which will remain female designated. Gender inclusive pairs/groups may select any room at lottery. Shared common hall bathrooms will continue to be gender designated in East and Martin Luther Halls.
As a part of Muhlenberg's commitment to inclusion, we welcome individuals to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. Anyone who does not identify on a gender binary is welcome to use any bathroom in the building regardless of gender, gender identity, and gender expression.
East Hall also has several Gender Inclusive bathrooms throughout the building. The Office of Housing & Residence Life will continue the practice of reviewing bed space throughout the lottery process. During the general lottery, rooms or suites may be gender specified to ensure enough beds are available to everyone going through the lottery.
Gender Inclusive Housing â First Year and Transfer students Gender inclusive housing is available to first year students in Prosser and Walz Halls. Brown Hall is designated as female. Most floors are divided into wings with gender designated bathrooms. There is also a floor that students of all genders can request that has gender inclusive bathrooms. Students can request this floor through the Online Housing Application for Incoming Students. First-year and transfer students can also indicate that they are interested in gender inclusive housing by emailing housing@muhlenberg.edu. Housing & Residence Life staff will work individually with these students.
As a part of Muhlenberg's commitment to inclusion, we welcome individuals to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. Anyone who does not identify on a gender binary is welcome to use any bathroom in the building regardless of gender, gender identity, and gender expression.
 
If you have questions regarding gender-identity, gender-expression, gender non-conforming or transgender student support, feel free to contact Robin Riley-Casey, Director of Multicultural Life and LGBT Coordinator at rriley-casey@muhlenberg.edu

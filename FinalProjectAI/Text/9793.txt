For the third year in a row, Muhlenberg has received a STARS Gold Rating for Sustainability Achievements from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) Sustainable Campus Index (SCI). The rating is based on campus sustainability efforts in five areas: academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation and leadership.
In the same report, the College has also again been recognized for best practices in the area of water use, receiving a score of 100 percent. The College tied for the sixth spot among all higher education institutions nationally for water conservation and reuse, as well as effective rainwater management practices.

AASHEâs Sustainable Campus Index recognizes top-performing colleges and universities in 17 sustainability impact areas and provides overall recognition by institution type, as measured by the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS). STARS is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance.
The 2021 STARS reports were submitted by over 550 institutions in 14 countries, covering 49 US States, the District of Columbia and eight Canadian provinces.

Located in the vibrant Lehigh Valley, less than 90 miles west of New York City and 60 miles north of Philadelphia, Allentown is Pennsylvaniaâs third-largest, and fastest-growing, city. Nicknamed âthe Queen City,â it is home to three historic districts and one of the best park systems in the United Statesâand thanks to more than $1 billion in recent downtown investments, was recently honored as a finalist for a global award for excellence. 

Entrepreneurial Hub 
Allentown is a magnet for entrepreneurs and new businesses ranging from tech and design to logistics, finance, medicine and biotechnology. In fact, the Lehigh Valley is ranked a top region for economic development. These businesses offer internships and full-time employment opportunities to Muhlenberg students and alumni.

Natural Beauty
The Lehigh Valley is home to an extensive park system with a variety of gardens and trails. Every year several of these parks sponsor nationally known cultural festivals.

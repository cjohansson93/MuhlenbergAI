Visiting the Library

Trexler Library is committed to remaining open for Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff. In order to do so, we have made some changes to keep the building open and our patrons safe.
Trexler Library is physically open to all patrons, but after 8 pm, the building is only accessible via Muhlenberg ID only for current students, faculty, and staff. While in the building, remember to wear your mask properly so it covers both your mouth and nose. Your mask keeps others safe and their masks keep you safe. If you have forgotten your mask, Trexler Library has disposable masks available on A-Level across from the Lending Services desk. 
Eating and drinking are permitted in the building, however, masks must be put back on when not actively eating or drinking.
Anyone not adhering to the College's Masking Policy will be reported to the Dean of Students Office/Campus Safety.
Please visit our Hours & Directions page to see a full listing of our hours of operation.

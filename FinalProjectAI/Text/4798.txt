men’s golf rallies to finish third





Oyer finished the season with a 78.0 stroke average.




The Muhlenberg men’s golf team overtook an opponent in each of the final two rounds and finished third at the Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by Ursinus at Stonewall Golf Club in Elverson, Pa.

The Mules were fifth after shooting a 316 in the first round and moved up to fourth after improving by a stroke in the second round, which consisted of nine holes on Saturday and nine on Sunday. The third round was their best, with a score of 310, and allowed them to leap over first-round co-leader Gettysburg by two strokes.

It was the first time since 2005 that Muhlenberg bettered its total in each successive round of a three-round tournament. The third-place finish matched the Mules’ showing last year.

Junior Zachary Oyer earned All-CC honors by finishing fourth with a 228, four strokes off the lead. He shot in the 70s in all three rounds for the second time in three years at the CC Championships. After tying for 10th in 2008 and tying for sixth last year, Oyer had the best finish by a Muhlenberg golfer since 2004.

Senior Biff Slocum tied for 13th with a 54-hole total of 236. Junior Jordan Carpenter shot a season-best 77 in the second round, and sophomores Matthew Cohen (77) and Zack Meyers (78) both had their best round of the tournament over the final 18 holes.

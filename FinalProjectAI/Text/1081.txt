Center for Ethics Announces Theme, Fall Schedule



"Pandemic: Response, Resilience, Reflection" will provide a framework to look back and examine the ethical questions that arose due to the global impact of the COVID-19 virus.


	 Tuesday, August 24, 2021  09:38 AM


The onset of the current global pandemic has upended life for many people. It has wrought economic hardship, devastated families, strained global healthcare systems and exaggerated social inequalities. It has also presented moments of possibility, including incredible scientific collaboration and research on treatments and vaccines, the emergence of local, mutual aid networks to provide essential resources for assisting neighbors and inspired innovations in work and education.
"Pandemic: Response, Resilience, Reflection" explores some of the ethical questions that arise when we pause to think about the global pandemic including: What lessons can be learned from the scientific collaboration on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines? From receiving a vaccine to wearing masks, how has the pandemic exposed the limits and obligations of individual and collective ethical behavior? How should we respond to the ways in which the pandemic has had disparate impacts based on race and class? How do we think about the rationing of care when health systems get overwhelmed?

Dan Royles, HistorianâDonât We Die Too?: Race and Sexuality in the Early AIDS CrisisâThursday, October 21; at 7 p.mMiller Forum, Moyer Hall
HIV/AIDS has disproportionately affected Black communities in the United States since the disease was first identified by doctors in 1981. Today, African Americans account for almost 42 percent of new HIV diagnoses each year, despite being only 13 percent of the U.S. population. While racial disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic are well documented, the history of African American responses to the disease have been largely ignored in emerging narratives of AIDS and AIDS activism in the United States. This talk will trace early efforts to respond to AIDS in Philadelphia's African American community and the ways that work was complicated by struggles over race, sexuality and urban space in the City of Brotherly Love. 
Dan Royles is an assistant professor of history at Florida International University. He is the author of To Make the Wounded Whole: The African American Struggle against HIV/AIDS and is working on a multi-year study for the National Park Service on the history of anti-Black violence in the United States and its territories since 1500 as well as a social, cultural and intellectual biography of Claude Brown, author of the celebrated book Manchild in the Promised Land.
The Center for Ethics is proud to co-sponsor this talk with the â40 Years of HIV/AIDS Activism: Perspectives from Around the Globeâ lecture series and the Shankweiler Scholar Honors Program.

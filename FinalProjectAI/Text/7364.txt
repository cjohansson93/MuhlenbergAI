Tennis Teams Split on Senior Day
 Saturday, April 5, 2014 - page 4







					 



After recognizing their six seniors prior to the matches, the Muhlenberg tennis teams split with Washington College. The women won, 6-3, for their third straight Centennial Conference victory, but the men lost, 7-2.



Honored for the women were four-year starters Nina Sanders, Emily Szulman and Gabriela Contino. Szulman won her third singles match, 6-1, 6-2, while Contino (right) teamed with junior Jennifer Goldberg for an 8-1 win at third doubles.

The top two singles players accounted for all three points for the Shorewomen, who qualified for the CC playoffs last year. The Mules showed their depth, however, dropping only six games total in the six matches they won.

Goldberg followed her doubles win with a 6-1, 6-0 victory at No. 4 singles, while junior Sharen Resnikoff, an 8-0 winner with freshman Sara Finger at No. 2 doubles, took her No. 5 singles match by a 6-0, 6-1 final.

Freshman Jamie Rosenblum notched her second straight 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 6 singles, extending her personal winning streak to four. She has won her last five regular sets at love (she played a pro set in between).

The men saluted two-year captains Ben Berkowitz and Jason Teitelbaum, along with Ross Handler. After losing all three doubles matches, the Mules still had a chance to win, down 4-2 with three matches left on the court, but Washington won all three.

Juniors Daniel Lakhman at No. 1  and Eric Chavis at No. 4 were singles winners for Muhlenberg.

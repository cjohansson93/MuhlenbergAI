Brandon Girouard  Class of 2008 Dual Major in Dance and Theatre
Dancer




Since graduating in 2008, I have gone on to an exciting and diverse career, which has merged my passions for performance and education.  Most recently, I collaborated with Broadway veteran Shannon Lewis to choreograph and direct the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Special Olympics.  The ceremonies involved dozens of performers and were viewed by more than 50,000 Special Olympics participants.  Some of my other experiences as a choreographer include choreographing a full-scale stage production for the Epcot Stage, as well as assistant choreographing for Broadway in Capetown, South Africa. Aside from choreographing, I have enjoyed numerous opportunities to perform, having worked with dance companies such as dancetheatreX, Melanie Stewart Dance Theatre, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, Koresh Dance, and Plasma Dance Theatre. Some of my other professional performance credits include Nickelodeon’s Kids Choice Awards and the National Tour of “West Side Story,” as well as stints with Carnival Cruise Lines and Disney.  
Although I love to perform and choreograph, my passion for education still simmers. After graduating from NYU with my Masters of Fine Arts degree I began teaching at many dance conservatories on Long Island, NY. I also reside as Guest Faculty at Broadway Dance Center in New York City, and Studio Harmonic in Paris.  One of my newest endeavors has been founding and directing Quest Intensive, a cutting-edge in-classroom studio tour, which works with the industry’s leading names in Broadway, Concert Tours, Professional Dance Companies, Talent Representation and Casting Directors. 

I attended Muhlenberg knowing that I wanted to pursue a career in either dance or theatre, but was unsure of which direction to follow. Muhlenberg gave me a solid foundation in understanding movement both academically and kinesthetically – principles that I find a majority of today's professionals lack. I was trained and nurtured by solid faculty - constantly pushing my limits, encouraging me to ask questions, find my inner voice, and develop a strong point-of-view. My involvement in ACDFA, NYC Dance Theatre Workshop, and the several productions I was involved in provided a professional aspect to my education and has helped me launch my career today. Muhlenberg developed me into a strong thinker and a stronger technician. Being surrounded by professionals from several different departments allowed me to expand my ideas and strengthen my weaknesses. The Muhlenberg Department of Theatre & Dance teaches you to collaborate, articulate ideas, and to expand beyond your comfort zones. Today, I have become a true artist because of the education I earned from Muhlenberg. I encourage all my students to take the first bus to Allentown and see for themselves one of the best programs in the country.  www.bgprogression.com

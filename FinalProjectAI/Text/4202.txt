baseball falls in makeup game



The Muhlenberg baseball team led or was tied for almost the entire game, but Ursinus scored three times in the bottom of the eighth to pull out a 10-9 win in the makeup
of a game rained out on Friday.

The Mules (6-18-1, 3-3) broke a 7-all tie by scoring twice in the top of the seventh on RBI singles by seniors Jeff Puklin and
Joseph DiCecilia. The Bears, who had come from three runs down to tie the game, took their first and only lead on a two-out, 
two-run double in the bottom of the eighth. Muhlenberg got the tying run to second in the ninth but suffered its third one-run loss in six 
Centennial Conference games.

Freshman John Scuderi had a big day for the Mules, going 4-for-5 with two doubles and four runs scored. DiCecilia (right)
drove in three runs, and Puklin and senior Bobby Spindler had two hits apiece.

Gifts, pledges and pledge payments may be made with Visa, MasterCard or American Express by calling 800-859-2243 or online. Contact Heather Ennis at 484-664-3748 or email heatherennis@muhlenberg.edu if you have any questions.
Cash or CheckCurrent law allows you to deduct the full amount of your cash gift in the year the gift is made up to an amount equal to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income. Checks should be made payable to Muhlenberg College and sent to 2400 Chew Street, Allentown, Pa. 18104.Matching GiftsThousands of companies and corporate foundations match gifts to non-profit institutions. You can double or even triple the value of your gift and enhance your total toward a leadership level contribution by simply notifying your employer of your gift to Muhlenberg. You may be eligible to submit matching gift claims from both your own and your partnerâs employer for the same gift. Contact the human resources office at your employer, your partnerâs employer or your former employer (if you are retired) to inquire about their matching gift program. Call 1-800-859-2243 for more information.Gifts of StockIf you have owned a stock for more than 12 months and it has appreciated in value during that time, you would incur a capital gains tax by selling it. However, if you give that stock to Muhlenberg as a gift, you avoid the capital gains tax and can also claim an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the gift up to an amount equal to 30 percent of your adjusted gross income. Any unused deduction may be carried forward for up to five years. Call 1-800-859-2243 for more information.Electronic Transfers of Shares of Publicly Traded Stock and Mutual FundsShares of publicly traded companies and mutual funds may be transferred electronically to Muhlenberg College by using the Muhlenberg account at Stifel Nicolaus.
Remember to instruct your broker to contact Mark Mazer, Senior Director of Advancement Services, at 1-800-859-2243 or mmazer@muhlenberg.edu regarding the pending transfer, and to share with us your name, the number of shares, the name of the corporation or mutual fund and the anticipated date of transfer.
You will need to provide your broker with the DTC (Deposit Trust Company) number and Muhlenberg's account number. At Stifel Nicolaus, the DTC Number is 0793, and the Muhlenberg College Account Number is 4056-5163.  Our account representative is Brad Greenawald (610-782-5400). Muhlenberg's tax I.D. number is 23-1352664. Accuracy of DTC and account numbers is valid as of 10/1/13.Estate GiftsMembership in Muhlenberg's Circle of 1848 is open to all alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends who name the College as a beneficiary in their estate plan or through their will, life insurance policy, trust or retirement plan. Legacy gifts from Circle members have a substantial impact on the quality of learning Muhlenberg offers its students and ensure the continued vitality and development of the College from one generation to the next. 
Red Door DialersThe Red Door Dialers are students who build and strengthen the relationship between Muhlenberg alumni, parents, donors and friends while generating philanthropic support for the College. You may hear from a Red Door Dialer over the phone, in a video or with a handwritten note during giving campaigns. When your phone rings, we hope that you will take a moment to speak with a student caller - they love talking to you! Gifts, pledges and pledge payments may be made with Visa, MasterCard or American Express online here. Contact Brooke Schaffer at 484-664-4069 or email brookeschaffer@muhlenberg.edu if you have any questions.

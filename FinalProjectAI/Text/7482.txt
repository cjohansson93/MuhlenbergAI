Baseball Hangs On for Third Straight Win
 Friday, March 7, 2014

Strong starting pitching, timely hitting and clutch closing by a reliever in his first save opportunity carried the Muhlenberg baseball team to a 9-7 win against New Paltz State.




In three appearances this season, Fenster has retired 14 of the 16 batters he has faced.



The Mules (5-4) managed only six hits, but scored five runs on two of them in winning their third straight game. After starting their Spring Break trip with 
four straight losses, they have a chance to come home with a .500 record in Myrtle Beach.

Junior Matthew Lawsky continued the run of excellent pitching by the starting staff, allowing only two earned runs and six hits in seven innings
to earn his second win of the season. In the last four games, Muhlenberg starters have allowed just three earned runs in 29 1/3 innings.




Junior Chris Flynn drove in two runs with an infield single and a groundout and also stole a base.



Lawsky left with a 6-3 lead, built mostly in a five-run bottom of the fourth. Three New Paltz errors gave the Mules four extra outs in the inning, and they took 
full advantage. The big blow was a two-out, bases-clearing double by junior Danny Usewick deep into the gap in left-center.

After another Hawk error in the bottom of the eighth, junior Jimmy Cody delivered a two-run double to extend Muhlenberg’ lead to 9-4.

Those runs proved to be crucial when the Hawks (2-3) mounted a rally in the top of the ninth. Two runs were in and two runners were on base with only one out when junior Seth Fenster
came in from the bullpen. After allowing an RBI single to make it 9-7 and an infield single to load the bases, Fenster struck out New Paltz’ No. 5 hitter,
then ended the game on a foul popout to nail down his first career save – just a day after earning his first career win.

Senior John Scuderi had two hits for the Mules.

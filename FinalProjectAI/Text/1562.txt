Muhlenberg College and Touchstone Theatre have partnered to celebrate the classic novel "Don Quixote" through community readings of the text. These groups, held throughout the Lehigh Valley, are open to everyone from long-time fans, to those new to Miguel Cervantes' most famous work. Bring your own copy of "Don Quixote" - in English, Spanish, or any of the many languages into which this book has been translated, or pick up copies at the readings. Two different reading circles will be held on both Friday and Wednesday evenings. The first reading will be Friday, February 18, 2005 from 6- 7 p.m. at South Bethlehem Neighborhood Center, 700 Evans Street, Bethlehem, with subsequent readings at the same location and time every other week. The Wednesday night group will begin Wednesday, February 23, 2005 from 7-8 p.m. at St. John's Lutheran Church, 32 S. 5th Street, Allentown. This circle will also meet at the same time and location bi-weekly.ReleasedFebruary 8, 2005 For more information, contactErika Sutherland 484-664-3518Javier Toro 610-865-2791

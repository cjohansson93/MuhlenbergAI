Teaching Interests
My primary teaching interests are in the areas of gender, politics and American political development. I teach courses in parties and interest groups, the U.S. Congress, the American presidency, civic engagement and voter participation and gender and politics.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research interests are diverse but essentially rooted in a central focus on state-society relationships. I study how groups of individuals and interests mobilize around and interact with political institutions. I have a particular interest in women's political engagement and ambition, American political development and community-based forms of engagement through which citizens work for political and social change. I'm also deeply rooted in research here in the Lehigh Valley, particularly around issues created to the social determinants of health, aging and disability.

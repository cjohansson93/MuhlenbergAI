Men's Golf Second in Second Tournament of Season
 Thursday, September 13, 2012







					 




Two Muhlenberg teams that play their championship seasons in the spring opened their fall schedules this week.

Men’s golf finished eighth at the Messiah Falcon Classic and second at the Moravian Fall Invitational, and women’s tennis fell at Moravian, 5-4, in a Matte Award match.


Freshman Jonathan Graulich made a splash for the golf team at his second career tournament, shooting a 1-over-par 73 at Moravian to place third, two strokes off the lead. 
En route to the lowest round by a Mule freshman in seven years, Graulich scored an eagle on the 400-yard, par-4 18th hole.

The Moravian Fall Invitational was the ninth tournament in which Muhlenberg finished first or second since the 2010-11 year. At Messiah, the Mules finished ahead of three of the other four Centennial Conference teams in the field.

Junior Chris DiMaio (left) was the only Muhlenberg player to shoot in the 70s in both tournaments, carding a 79 at Messiah and a 78 to tie for ninth place at Moravian. Junior Christopher Lucarelli also finished with a 79 at Messiah.

Playing without two of its top singles players, who are studying abroad this semester, women’s tennis dropped a tight 5-4 match at Moravian. The result evened the 2012-13 Matte Award standings at 1-1.

The outcome hinged on three three-set matches at the bottom of the singles ladder. Muhlenberg won at No. 6, with senior Lauren Barnett (right) coming back after dropping the first set, but the Greyhounds took the other two.

Sophomore Sharen Resnikoff teamed with Amanda von Taube for an 8-3 win at second doubles, then won her No. 2 singles match in straight sets. Sophomore Jennifer Goldberg also won at singles.

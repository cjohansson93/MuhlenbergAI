The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team lost a competitive 6-3 match to eight-time defending Freedom Conference champion Wilkes in its first home match and first dual match of the year.

The Colonels picked up five of their wins in close matches, including three singles matches that went to three sets.

The team of sophomore Sara Finger and senior Jennifer Goldberg won a thrilling back-and-forth match at No. 1 doubles, prevailing 7-1 in a tiebreaker.

Finger (left) went on to a more comfortable 6-2, 6-0 win at No. 1 singles against a first-team all-conference player. Sophomore Jamie Rosenblum picked up the Mules’ other win, 6-4, 6-0 at No. 4.

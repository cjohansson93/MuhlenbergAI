'Berg featured in new Princeton Review Book "Colleges That Pay You Back: 2015 Edition" 


Muhlenberg College is one of the nation's best colleges for students seeking great academics, outstanding career preparation and generous financial aid â according to The Princeton Review.


	 Tuesday, February 3, 2015  03:56 PM

The college is one of 200 schools that the education services company profiles in its just published book, Colleges That Pay You Back: The 200 Best Value Colleges and What It Takes to Get In - 2015 Edition (Penguin Random House / Princeton Review, $21.99, February 3, 2015). The school is also featured on The Princeton Review's site.
The Princeton Review developed a unique "Return-on-Education" (ROE) rating to winnow its list of the 200 colleges for this new book. ROE measures 40 weighted data points – everything from academics, cost, financial aid and student debt to statistics on graduation rates, alumni salaries and job satisfaction. The Company based its ROE rating on it data collected in 2013-14 from its surveys of administrators and students at 650 colleges, plus surveys conducted by PayScale.com through April 2014 of alumni of the same schools. 
"We salute and highly recommend Muhlenberg College and all of our Colleges That Pay You Back schools. They stand out for their excellent academics, impressive career preparation services and affordability to students with need – via comparatively low sticker prices, generous financial aid or both," said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review’s Senior VP/Publisher and lead author of the book. “Plus their students graduate with great career prospects."
In the book's profile of Muhlenberg, The Princeton Review editors praise the school for its generous financial aid packages, its internship manual and student research and scholarship program. Muhlenberg students described the college as "an excellent place to go if you're serious about academics, and you want to try a lot of things throughout your undergraduate career." The "Career Information" section of the profile lists a high Return-on-Education (ROE) rating score of 86% for Muhlenberg. The profile also reports PayScale.com figures on median salaries of Muhlenberg's alumni, showing the median starting salary as $44,800 and median mid-career salary as $88,800.
The Princeton Review is also known for its annual school rankings and profiles in its book, The Best 379 Colleges, published in August, and its books, The Best 296 Business Schools and The Best 169 Law Schools, published in October. The company also profiles schools in its Guide to Green Colleges, an annual free downloadable book published in April. The Princeton Review is not affiliated with Princeton University, and it is not a magazine.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year college located in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Muhlenberg offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, along with selected pre-professional studies and a number of interdisciplinary majors.

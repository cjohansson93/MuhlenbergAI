zabrecky named player of the week



Sophomore Alita Zabrecky of the Muhlenberg womens basketball team was named Centennial Conference player of the week for the second time this season.

Zabrecky averaged 17.5 points and 7.0 rebounds while shooting 56.5 percent from the field in leading the Mules to a pair of CC road wins against playoff contenders. She also had 4 assists and 4 steals in the two games. 

Zabrecky scored 21 points, one short of her career high, in only 26 minutes at Swarthmore and added 14 points and 8 rebounds at Franklin & Marshall. In both games, she played a prominent role in game-deciding runs. Against Swarthmore, she recorded 5 points, 3 rebounds and 2 steals in a 15-0 second-half run that turned a 45-42 deficit into a 57-45 lead, and against F&M she scored 8 points in a 15-2 burst that put the game out of reach after the Diplomats had cut a 17-point lead to 6.

For the season, Zabrecky is Muhlenbergs second-leading scorer, averaging 11.1 points per game. She also is tied for second on the team in rebounding, at 5.4 per game. In the CC, she is sixth in steals per game (2.10) and ninth in field-goal percentage (.460).

The two wins last week left Muhlenberg in sole possession of second place in the CC with two weeks remaining in the regular season. The Mules (15-5, 11-4) trail first-place Johns Hopkins (14-3) by a game in the loss column and lead third-place Gettysburg (11-5) by the same margin. Four other teams have seven or eight losses.

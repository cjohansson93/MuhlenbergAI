Welcome to Muhlenberg College Health Services.
We are passionate about providing you with prompt and high quality medical care so you can focus on why you came to Muhlenberg College in the first place: to receive an extraordinary educational experience, both in and out of the classroom.  We are nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians.  Together we are your advocates.
This website is not intended to replace face-to-face interaction with our staff, but to introduce you to many of the resources available right here on our campus.
Take a look at what we can offer you and know that we are here for you.  We invite you to visit and meet us personally in Health Services (located in the Life Sports Center, Suite 100).

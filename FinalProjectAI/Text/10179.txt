The Infiltrators Screening and Discussion with Alex RiveraWednesday, February 12 at 7 p.m. in Trumbower 130 (Lithgow Auditorium)
Award-winning filmmaker Alex Rivera will present and discuss his new film, The Infiltrators. Designed in a hybrid cinematic language, combining familiar documentary form and scripted narrative, The Infiltrators sets out to map an uncharted domain: inside an Obama-era immigration detention system. Based on true events, The Infiltrators is both a suspenseful account of a high-stakes mission and an emotionally charged portrait of visionary youth fighting for their community.
"Conference on Refugees, Migration and the UN" with Richard Towle, acting director of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), New York OfficeFriday, February 21 from 9:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. in the Seegers Union Event SpaceIn partnership with the Humpty Dumpty Institute and the United Nations
Prior to his role as acting director of UNHCR, Richard Towle previously served as the UNHCR Representative in Malaysia. He is a New Zealander who joined UNHCR in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, working in a variety of capacities with Vietnamese refugees, then moved to the London office of UNHCR. He has since held various senior legal roles in the Department of International Protection at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva and has been involved in the UNHCR development of polities and operations relating to human rights, internally displaced persons and asylum-migration issues. His other United Nations experience includes a role as Chief of Mission for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, from 2001 to 2003. Towle served as a member of the New Zealand Refugee Status Appeal Authority from 2005 to 2006, as a deputy chair of the Hong Kong Refugee Status Review Board and as a lawyer in New Zealand specializing in refugee and human rights issues. He served as the UNHCR Regional Representative for Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, a post he held from 2007 till 2013.
Ayesha Ramachandran, associate professor of comparative literature, Yale University Friday, February 21 (2-3:30 p.m.) Miller Forum, Moyer Hall
Ramachandran is a literary critic and cultural historian of early modern Europe. Her recent work focuses on Europeâs relations with an expanding worldâher first book, The Worldmakers (University of Chicago Press, 2015) charts transnational encounters and the early mechanisms of globalization from the late fifteenth to the early eighteenth centuries.
Lifeboat Screening and Discussion with filmmaker Skye Fitzgerald Tuesday, March 10 (7 p.m.) Recital Hall, Baker Center for the Arts
Volunteers from a German non-profit risk the waves of the Mediterranean to pluck refugees from sinking rafts pushing off from Libya in the middle of the night. Lifeboat puts a human face on one of the world's greatest contemporary global crises and provides a spark of hope surrounding how civil society can intervene in the refugee crisis in a meaningful way.
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar: Valerie HudsonWe are sorry to report that this event has been canceled. We hope to reschedule our speaker's visit for the Fall 2020 semester.
Valerie M. Hudson holds the George H.W. Bush Chair in the Department of International Affairs at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, where she directs the program on Women, Peace and Security. Professor Hudson's research includes foreign policy analysis, security studies, gender and international relations and methodology. Hudson is one of the principal investigators of The WomanStats Project, which includes the largest compilation of data on the status of women in the world today.

Hamid will be on campus to discuss his novel, Exit West, which was read by Muhlenbergâs class of 2023 and other members of the College community.
Brigid Cohen, associate professor of music, New York UniversityWe are sorry to report that this event has been canceled. We hope to reschedule our speaker's visit for the Fall 2020 semester.
Brigid Cohen is a historical musicologist who specializes in the historiography of music and musicians in migration. Her research and teaching examine the mass dislocation of peoples over the last two centuries, addressing conditions of empire, globalization, genocide, exile and minority experience.

Arthur C. Brooks is Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School and Arthur C. Patterson Faculty Fellow at the Harvard Business School.

Brooks is the author of 11 books, including the national bestsellers âLove Your Enemiesâ (2019), âThe Conservative Heartâ (2015) and âThe Road to Freedomâ (2012). He is a columnist for the Washington Post, host of the podcast The Arthur Brooks Show and subject of the 2019 documentary film âThe Pursuit.â
About 'Borders, Nationalisms, Identities: The Ethics of Global Citizenship' 
We live in a global moment with controversies arising from a resurgence in nationalism, the simultaneous hardening and permeability of national borders and boundaries and increased flows of people as tourists, refugees, asylum seekers, laborers and students. Traffic in and exchange of raw materials, information, weapons and diseases have increasingly transformed national identities, cultures and conceptions of citizenship.
What are the ethical implications of these phenomena? How should we understand and respond to global changes in borders, nationalisms and identities? Are there historical precedents for such dynamic changes to the lives of peoples, states and our planet? What roles do new technology and communication play in crossing some borders while raising other barriers? How can we imagine our place in national and global societies when we are at the same time brought closer together and driven further apart?

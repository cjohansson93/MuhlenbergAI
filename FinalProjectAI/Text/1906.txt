Under the Yellow Ribbon Program, tuition and fees are fully covered for veterans with 100% eligibility under the GI BillÂ®.
Muhlenberg College has partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs in offering this scholarship which covers the difference between the cost of tuition and the reimbursed amount provided by the post 9/11 GI BillÂ®, thereby covering 100% of the tuition for eligible veterans.
Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies is proud to support the college experience for military personnel and veterans. We recognize the important contributions you and your family have made for our country and look forward to welcoming you to our campus. Contact our office to get started. Together we'll plan an academic path best suited to your professional goals. 
I would like to schedule an advisement session.



Contact the School of Continuing Studies at 484-664-3300 for additional information.

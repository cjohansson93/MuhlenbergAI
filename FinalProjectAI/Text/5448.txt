zeroes and heroes abound for football team


Many zeroes were in play for the Muhlenberg football team’s 38-7 home win against Juniata.

There were the three zeroes in the career milestones reached by seniors Eric Santagato



Frank Emmett (left) and Cameron Ahouse recorded second-half interceptions, giving the Mules 10 picks in the last four games.



(5,000 passing yards) and John DeLuca (3,000 rushing yards). There were the zero turnovers committed by the Mules, for the third week in a row. And of course, there were the zeroes still in the loss columns for Muhlenberg (5-0, 3-0), which has won 16 consecutive regular-season games and 11 straight Centennial Conference contests.

But the most important zero was probably in the points given up by the Mule defense. A week after allowing more than 500 yards to Johns Hopkins, the defense redeemed itself against a diverse Juniata offense that ranged from a five wide receiver set to the single wing. The Eagles’ lone touchdown came on a kickoff return.

Juniata (1-5, 1-3), coming off its first CC win ever, completed a 48-yard pass on its first drive and a 37-yard pass on its last possession of the first half. Other than those two plays, the Muhlenberg 
defense allowed eight completions in 23 attempts for only 34 yards. The Eagles finished with 204 total yards – just 54 in the second half – and were 1-for-10 on third-down conversions.

As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense, and the Mule offense helped out its defensive teammates by keeping them off the field. Muhlenberg possessed the ball for 37:15 (including all but 59 seconds of the second quarter), and Juniata ran only 46 offensive plays.

Leading the offense were the usual suspects. Santagato completed 19 of 21 passes, tying the CC record and 



Sophomore Scott Gavin’s flying tackle of Kyle McKechnie was good for a 7-yard loss.



breaking the school record for completion percentage in a game (.905), for 262 yards and two touchdowns. He ended the day with 5,189 career yards. DeLuca rushed for 116 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries, bringing his career total to 3,101 rushing yards.

Junior receiver Phil Cresta also had a big day, catching a career-high nine passes for 155 yards and a score. He has scored a touchdown in six consecutive games.

For the fifth time in as many games this year, the Mules scored on their first drive, marching 68 


Men’s Soccer Stunned by Washington



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team suffered its first loss ever to Washington, falling 2-1.

The Shoremen (3-8, 1-4) scored twice in a span of 43 seconds early in the second half, and the Mules (7-4-1, 2-2-1) could only get one of the goals back, on a shot by junior Eric Miller with less than five minutes to play.

Muhlenberg came into the game with a 19-0-2 all-time series lead.

yards in seven plays. A 37-yard run by DeLuca set up Santagato’s 10-yard scoring strike to senior Joe Caporoso, who caught a TD pass for the second straight game.

The Eagles answered by driving to the Muhlenberg 5-yard line in only three plays, but their next three plays went nowhere, and on fourth down senior William Moates blocked a 22-yard field goal try.

The Mules needed only seven plays to drive 88 yards for their second score, a 4-yard run by DeLuca with 3:49 left in the first quarter. The key play was Cresta’s 59-yard reception.

A 33-yard field goal by sophomore Michael Katz extended the lead to 17-0, capping a 14-play, 65-yard, 7:41 drive. Juniata returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown, and Muhlenberg followed with another drive of more than seven minutes, although it did not lead to points.

Ahead 17-7 at halftime, Muhlenberg extended the lead on Santagato’s 38-yard pass to Cresta, a 5-yard run by DeLuca and a 2-yard run by senior Erik Snyder.

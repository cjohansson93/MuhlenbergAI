Mondays with Muhlie

									
Most Mondays at 2:00 during the school year, join us to chat about anything and everything related to Mule sports on "Mondays with Muhlie," a weekly interactive chat. We'll look at the season so far, what's coming up, and take questions from viewers. 

On Monday, April 16, we'll look ahead to the final few weeks of the spring sports season.

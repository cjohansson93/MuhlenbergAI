Men's Soccer Returns to Swarthmore, with Same Result
 Wednesday, September 28, 2011 - page 2







					 


It was an eerily bad feeling of deja vu for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team at Swarthmore.

For the second time in a row, the Mules battled the Garnet into double overtime on their home field. And just like last season’s Centennial Conference championship game, Swarthmore scored in the second extra period for a 2-1 win.

Neither team was able to generate any great scoring chances during the first 45 minutes of play, but the No. 14 Garnet wasted little time after the break. 

Swarthmore put home a deflection off of Mule 

goalkeeper Ari Nutovits just six minutes into the second half to take a 1-0 lead.

Following that goal, Muhlenberg, ranked third in the most recent regional poll, amped up its offensive pressure. But the Mules did not 


threaten the Garnet goal until Josh Luginbuhl chased after a bouncing loose ball in the 81st minute. 

Swarthmore’s keeper came off his line to try get to the throughball, but it bounced off of his hands and right to Luginbuhl (left), who was standing in front of a wide-open net. The senior calmly controlled the ball and fired a shot into the right corner to tie the game.

The Garnet, ranked fourth in the region, threatened during the final two minutes of regulation, but Nutovits (right) grabbed a loose ball in the box in traffic in the 88th minute to keep the score even and send the Mules to overtime for the third straight time at Swarthmore.

Muhlenberg got the ball deep into Swarthmore’s end during the first five minutes of the first overtime but was not able to get off a shot.

Less than three minutes into the second extra period, Swarthmore moved the ball down the field on a quick counterattack before scoring the game-winner in the 103rd minute to run its home unbeaten streak to 31 games. Last year’s winning goal came in the 106th minute.

The Garnet held a 20-2 advantage in shots, but Nutovits made seven saves to help keep the Mules in the game.

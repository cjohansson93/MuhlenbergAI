softball runs winning streak to six



Two Reach Milestones in Baseball Loss


Two players reached milestones, but it wasn’t enough for the Muhlenberg baseball team in a doubleheader loss to Franklin & Marshall.

Junior Eric Pomroy recorded his 100th career hit with a single in the fifth inning of Game 2. Three innings later, senior Eric Hammond became just the fifth player in team history to score 100 career runs.

Hammond touched home as part of a seven-run inning, but the Diplomats (12-9-1, 5-2) already had a 14-1 lead and went on to win, 14-8.

In the opening game, the Mules (9-15-1, 3-4) erased an early 2-0 deficit with the help of senior Edward Risener’s second home run of the season. F&M broke the game open by scoring six runs in the fourth and won, 8-3.

The Diplomats have beaten the Mules 11 straight times.

It wasn’t the offense or defense that was the biggest concern for the Muhlenberg softball team – it was the outfield fence.

When the Mules arrived at Cedarcreek Field for their

doubleheader against Washington, they found that string winds had blown down the fence off its posts. After some repair work, the team resumed its ongoing improvement project – rebuilding Muhlenberg into a Centennial Conference contender.

The Mules took two more steps with a 3-2, 5-0 sweep, extending their winning streak to six. Their 7-1 start in the CC is the best since the 2001 squad opened up 10-1. 

Late dramatics gave Muhlenberg (12-10 overall) the win in the opening game. The Mules trailed 2-0 before scoring three times in the bottom of the seventh to walk off with the win.
 
Senior RiRi Ferrigno started the winning rally with a single and crossed to third on a double by freshman Maggie Scarpelli. A two-run single by senior Samantha Crist tied the score.

Freshman Brittany Blohm forced Crist and went to second on a single by junior Allie Saltstein. After the second out, sophomore Jess Kasza lined a pitch into center. The Washington outfielder dove for the ball and came close to catching it, but despite the protests of the Shorewomen, the umpires ruled it no catch, and Blohm came home with the winning run.

The second game featured another impressive pitching performance from sophomore Alyssa Bruckner, who tossed her second straight shutout. Although she didn’t duplicate her no-hit effort against Dickinson, she allowed only four hits and got help in the sixth when Saltstein threw out a runner at home plate from right field.

Saltstein also drove in the first run of the game with a second-inning double. Sacrifice flies by Kasza and Scarpelli and an RBI single by Blohm gave the Mules a 4-0 lead. The fifth run scored on an error.

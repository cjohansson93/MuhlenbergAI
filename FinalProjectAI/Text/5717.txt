four honored by d3football.com


Four members of the Muhlenberg College football team received recognition on the D3football.com All-South Region team.

Head coach Mike Donnelly was named South Region coach of the year 


after leading the Mules to the Centennial Conference championship and their 
first undefeated regular-season in the 106-year history of the program. It is the second such honor for Donnelly, who also received regional coach-of-the-year laurels from the American Football Coaches Association.

Two defensive 

players, senior end Chris Musselman and senior linebacker Dustin Good, were selected to the second team, while senior tight end Matt Johnson was a third-team choice.

Musselman (left), a unanimous first-team All-Centennial Conference selection, led the Mules with eight sacks among his 43 total tackles. He was second on the team with 12½ tackles for loss and added four pass breakups, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Musselman finished his career second on the team’s all-time list with 22 career sacks.

Good (right), also voted to the All-CC first team, led Muhlenberg in tackles for loss (16) and solo tackles (41). He also recorded five sacks, three breakups, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. Good ended his career with 196 tackles, including 33 tackles for loss.

Musselman and Good led a unit that ranks in the top 10 in Division III in total defense, scoring defense, pass efficiency defense, sacks, fumbles recovered and turnover margin.

Johnson rewrote the record book for tight ends, setting school records for receptions (54), yards (837) and touchdowns (six) and leading Muhlenberg in all three categories. His 54 receptions were the fourth-most in a season in team history. Johnson’s final career numbers featured a rare combination of more than 1,000 yards receiving (1,059), 750 yards rushing (752) and 750 yards passing (875).

men’s basketball can’t complete comeback





Frankoski had five points and five rebounds.


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team pulled to within one point with less than two minutes to play but could not come up with the equalizer in falling to King’s, 55-48.

The Mules (1-3) struggled from the field in the first 

half and entered the break trailing 24-18. Things appeared to turn around for Muhlenberg at the 
start the second period, as sophomore Spencer Liddic blocked a shot at one end of the floor and converted a layup on the other and freshman Rob Berish followed with a three-point play to open the half.

The Mules went cold again from there, as King’s (1-4) opened up its biggest second-half lead at 38-29. But a 17-9 run, which ended with two 
three-pointers by senior Ryan Foster and a layup by senior Brian Frankoski, brought Muhlenberg to within one at 47-46 with 
1:23 remaining.

King’s responded with a layup to go back up by three, and the Mules couldn’t convert their lone chance to tie. The Monarchs went 6-for-8 from the 
line the rest of the way to hang on for the victory.

Liddic finished with a career-high six blocks (two short of the school record) to go along with nine points and 11 rebounds. 
Berish led Muhlenberg with 10 points and added seven boards, and junior Evan Tozer scored nine points. (corrected 12/1)

E. S. Curtis The North American Indian: The Kwakiutl 


An intriguing segment of Edward S. Curtisâs Photogravures of The North American Indian is the focus of a year-long curatorial project for Marc Jablonksi '15.


	 Friday, June 12, 2015  11:29 AM

Volume X: The Kwakiutl was first published in the United States in 1915. Using 23 of the 36 large-plate prints from that volume, Jablonski takes viewers on a rich and intimate journey of indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest.
His approach to the project was underpinned by a sensitive balance between contemporary scholarship and an understanding for Curtis’s intent and the prevailing stereotypes and romanticized depictions of the early-20th century. From a technical point of view, he selected photogravures that attest to the quality of Curtis’s photographic abilities, his passion and dedication to the peoples he documented and the enduring aesthetic qualities of the photogravure process.
Marc, Class of 2015, is pursued a major in anthropology and a double minor in French and studio art.
E. S. Curtis The North American Indian: The Kwakiutl opens June 10 - July 26. The exhibition is free and open to the public.
Gallery hours: Tuesdays - Saturdays, noon – 8:00 p.m. and for audiences attending Muhlenberg Summer Music Theater matinees, Sundays, June 14, 21, 28 and July 12, 19, 26; 1 – 4:00 PM.

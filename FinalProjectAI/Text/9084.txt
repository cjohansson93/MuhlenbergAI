MissionThe Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics seeks to develop our capacities for ethical reflection, moral leadership, and responsible action by engaging community members in scholarly dialogue, intellectual analysis, and self-examination about contested ethical issues.
About the CenterThrough thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members. The current Center Director is Brian Mello, associate professor of political science.
How Programs are ChosenEach fall, the Director of the Center for Ethics calls together interested faculty, students, staff and members of the Muhlenberg community to discuss potential thematic programs. Once a theme has been chosen, the Director appoints a Program Director in consultation with the Provost; the Program Director is charged with program planning and coordination in conversation with the Center for Ethics Director, Advisory Board, and interested members of the Muhlenberg community representing a variety of academic disciplines and perspectives.

Muhlenberg announces partnerships with Boston University School of Medicine and Boston University Questrom School of Business



The new collaborations build upon Muhlenbergâs existing cooperative program relationship with Boston University that began in 2016. That relationship provides exceptional masterâs program candidates from Muhlenberg with an early acceptance program to Boston University School of Public Health, one of the top graduate programs for public health.

The partnership with Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) provides Muhlenberg students early access to one of the nationâs premiere medical schools and gives qualified students a clear path to acceptance midway through their Muhlenberg career.
"Pre-health has long been an exceptionally strong program at Muhlenberg College," said President Williams. "Between 2011 and 2016, 89 percent of students enrolled in Muhlenbergâs pre-medical program were accepted to U.S. medical schools, a track record that stands in rare company. We are delighted that our students will now receive opportunities for early access to one of the nation's premiere medical programs through our relationship with Boston University School of Medicine."
"One of our strengths as a medical school is our use of diverse pathways into the MD Program. The newest addition to that effort, our Muhlenberg affiliation, allows us to offer a facilitated admission process to excellent students from this small, highly selective liberal arts college with a long history of strong premed preparation," said Robert Witzburg, MD, associate dean and director of Admissions at Boston University School of Medicine. "Through this modified early decisions pathway, Muhlenberg students can focus on BUSM as early as the spring of their sophomore year, and our Committee on Admissions will have the opportunity to monitor their progress over time. We are excited about this new partnership and the terrific students we expect it will bring to our campus."
Muhlenberg students will typically apply to the program in the second semester of sophomore year, after having completed three semesters and taken six biology, chemistry or physics courses at Muhlenberg. (Juniors will be considered as well.) Qualified Muhlenberg students will then be offered an interview the summer after the studentâs junior year. Satisfactory completion of an admissions interview will result in conditional acceptance to the joint program pending completion of program requirements.
Boston University Questrom School of Business offers a nine month masterâs program designed for recent non-business graduates interested in building a foundation in business. The Masterâs in Management Studies (MSMS) program transcends the typical classroom model by challenging students to solve real business challeneges with partner companies in real time. The program was named one of The Most Innovative Business School Ideas of 2015 by Poets & Quants.
Ken Freeman, Allen Questrom Professor and Dean at the Questrom School of Business, views the corporate partnerships that are at the foundation of the new program as key to the future of business education. âThe inventive design and hands-on focus of the MSMS program is breaking new groundâproviding students with the skills employers are seeking.â
"Our new partnership with Boston University Questrom School of Business affirms the lifelong skills and career potential provided by an education that practices and embraces the liberal arts," said Muhlenberg College President John I. Williams, Jr. "Muhlenberg prepares students to be effective, integrative thinkers empowered to recognize and solve problems and work creatively, collaboratively and comprehensively to meet future challenges."
Qualified Muhlenberg students will receive early conditional admission to the Questrom School of Business and special consideration for scholarships prior to graduation from Muhlenberg. The partnership will continue to expand upon the College's excellent record of post-graduate success. The most recent career survey showed that within six months of graduation, 96 percent of Muhlenberg students were either employed full- or part-time or entering professional study.

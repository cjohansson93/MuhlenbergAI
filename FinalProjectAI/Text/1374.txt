A video message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg College community


	 Monday, August 24, 2020  09:56 AM

Dear Muhlenberg Community,
Today marks the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester. To the class of 2024, to our new transfer students, to our returning classes and to our faculty and staff, I write today to share my well wishes at the start of a new academic year.
Over the past several months you have heard time and time again that we are living in unprecedented times. But today, at the onset of a year destined to be marked by new knowledge, discoveries, friendships and successes, I want to remind you that despite these challenging circumstances we find ourselves in, the foundational values and mission of our College community remain steadfast.

I cannot wait to see how this College will support and challenge each other in the months ahead. To the students, faculty and staff who are new to Muhlenberg, you are joining a very special family. And to all of the community, from our newest members to the students and colleagues I have grown to know over the past months and years, I wish you the best as we convene our Fall 2020 semester.
Best wishes,
President Harring

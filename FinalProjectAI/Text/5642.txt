rough day for teams in sunshine state





Junior Sara Richwine plays defense in the women’s lacrosse game against Gettysburg.



Three Muhlenberg teams combined  to go 0-5 on the second day of Spring  Break in the Orlando area.


Softball had the best shot at winning, losing an extra-inning heartbreaker to Eastern Mennonite, 4-3. The Mules dropped their first game of the day to Bluffton, 7-0,
and completed a stretch of four games in less than 24 hours with a 1-3 record.

In the Eastern Mennonite game, Muhlenberg took a 2-0 lead in the top of the fourth on a two-run double by junior RiRi Ferrigno. After EMU plated single runs
in the fourth and seventh, the teams went to the international tiebreaker rule for the eighth. The Mules scored one run in the top of the frame, but Eastern Mennonite
came back with two in the bottom half to win the game.

Freshman Jess Kasza continued to swing a hot bat, picking up two singles in the nightcap. She has hit safely in all four games and is sporting a .545 batting average.

The  baseball team was swept by Wittenberg, 19-5 and 13-2, to fall to 1-3. Junior Christian Conti flirted with a cycle in the first game. He notched a single, double
and triple and had a long drive tracked down in the outfield.

New DigitalWatermarking Alorithm and its Application.
Digital watermarking is the process of hiding digital information in a carrier signal. The feature codes (such as hash value or message authentication code) of an object to be authenticated are self-embedded as a watermark, and then feature extracted in the same way will be compared with the watermark retrieved to determine if there are any changes. In such way, the ownership of the copyright of such signal could be identified. Digital watermarking is a very important technique on cryptography study.
For a grayscale digital image, the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light, that is, it carries only intensity information. The pixel value is ranged from 0 to 255, in which Black is 0 and White is 255. So every grayscale digital image watermark can be converted into a matrix and embedded to the digital image. A good watermarking should not only make the hidden watermark invisible to human eyes, but also be robust enough to survive most signal distortions.
In this talk, a new image digital watermarking algorithm will be introduced and simulation results will be presented as well.

Elyn Rykken, Muhlenberg College: Building Community through Problem Solving: Two geometry problems and a national mathematics program 
This talk begins with a practical home construction question encountered by my father in his volunteer work at Habitat for Humanity.  After considering this and a few related geometry problems, we will discuss the connection between these problems and the goals and aims of the Mathematics Teacherâs Circle Network.

February 26 - Math/CS Presentation
Linda McGuire, Muhlenberg College: Other Hidden Figures in Mathematics 
National data trends indicate a critical need to increase representation in the mathematical sciences. By sharing a series of mathematical stories and probing a few mathematical topics, we will consider how issues of identity, visibility, and belonging, influence who does mathematics. We will also discuss ways that we, as a community, might better promote inclusion in the practice of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
 
January 31 - Math/CS Colloquium Series
Elizabeth Eisenhauer is a PhD candidate in the Statistics Department at Penn State. She grew up in Cape May County, NJ and earned a BA in mathematics from The College of New Jersey. She currently works with Dr. Ephraim Hanks at Penn State on animal movement modeling.
A Lattice and Random Intermediate Point Sampling Design for Animal Movement
Animal movement studies have become ubiquitous in animal ecology for estimation of space use and analysis of movement behavior. In these studies, animal movement data are primarily collected at regular time intervals. We propose an irregular sampling design which could lead to greater efficiency and information gain in animal movement studies. Our novel sampling design, called lattice and random intermediate point (LARI), combines samples at regular and random time intervals. We compare the LARI sampling design to regular sampling designs in an example with common black carpenter ant location data, an example with guppy location data, and a simulation study of movement with a point of attraction. We modify a general stochastic differential equation model to allow for irregular time intervals and use this framework to compare sampling designs. When parameters are estimated reasonably well, regular sampling results in greater precision and accuracy in prediction of missing data. However, in each of the data and simulation examples explored in this paper, LARI sampling results in more accurate and precise parameter estimation, and thus better prediction of missing data as well. This result suggests that researchers might gain greater insight into underlying animal movement processes by choosing LARI sampling over regular sampling.
 
January 17Students from Muhlenberg presented their research at the Joint Mathematics Meeting's Student Research Poster Session, on Friday, January 17, 2020, in Denver Colorado. Brittany Gelb (Class of 2021), Olivia Schwager (2020) and Jordan Segrave (2020) presented their work at the session, which is reserved for undergraduate and first-year graduate students submitting posters on work done while an undergraduate. Posters were viewed during the session and feedback was provided by professionals and mathematicians. The Joint Mathematics Meeting is the largest annual mathematics meeting in the world and offers a variety of sessions that are designed to appeal to undergraduates.

November 1Math/CS Colloquium Series
Michael Tait, Villanova University
The card game SET, finite geometry, and additive combinatorics
In this talk we will discuss the connection between the card game SET and one of the most famous problems in combinatorics: the cap-set problem.
The cap-set problem and a generalization of it that we will discuss will foray into the worlds of finite geometry and combinatorial number theory. The talk will be accessible to undergraduate students.
This is joint work with Alice Huang and Rob Won.
Dr. Michael Tait is an assistant professor with the Villanova University Department of Mathematics. He completed his PhD in 2016 at UC-San Diego under the direction of Jacques Baudouin Alain Verstraete. Prior to arriving at Villanova University, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship mentored by Po-Shen Loh at Carnegie Mellon University. He recently received a National Science Foundation grant to research algebraic methods in extremal combinatorics. He is an avid runner and sports enthusiast, particularly baseball.

Dr. William Dunham, Emeritus Truman Koehler Professor of Mathematics
How Odd are Odd Perfect Numbers?
Greek mathematicians defined a whole number to be perfect if it is the sum of its proper divisors, where âproperâ means the divisor is smaller than the number itself.   An example is  6 ,  because the sum of its proper divisors is  1 + 2 + 3 = 6 .   Since classical times, 51 perfect numbers have been found â¦ and every one of them is even.
That raises an obvious question: are there any odd perfect numbers?  To date, no one knows the answer.  It is one of the true mysteries of mathematics.
In this talk, we trace the history of perfect numbers.  This will lead us to an 1888 argument in which J. J. Sylvester proved that, if an odd perfect number does exist, then it must have at least three different prime factors.   Although this property is far from self-evident, Sylvesterâs elegant proof requires nothing more sophisticated than geometric series.
So, weâll see a bit of history and a bit of mathematics as we dabble in the challenging realm of number theory.
William Dunham (Ph. D., Ohio State, 1974) is a historian of mathematics who has authored four books on the subject: Journey Through Genius, The Mathematical Universe, Euler: The Master of Us All, and The Calculus Gallery. After retiring from Muhlenberg College (emeritus, 2014), he has held visiting positions at Harvard, Princeton, Penn, Cornell, and Bryn Mawr, where he and wife Penny currently are Research Associates in Mathematics.

Privacy has become an issue of increasing importance in todayâs world of networked computing, mobile devices, the Internet of Things, and large-scale data analysis. This talk describes several privacy  solutions and challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of  differential privacy in the context of human mobility modeling based on fine-grained mobile telephone data. We also discuss âside channelsâ in Facebook and whether they should be viewed as a privacy problem. Finally, we discuss the potential use of differential privacy in conjunction with secure distributed computation, each of which  provide different kinds of privacy protection.

Armin Mikler, University of North Texas - "RE-PLAN: A Framework for Responding to Biochemical Emergencies"
Emergencies stemming from the release of harmful biochemical substances demand a timely response. Therefore, local governments are required to maintain functional plans for receiving medical countermeasures (MCMs) from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributing them within federally-mandated timeframes.
Determining optimal placement of clinics for the distribution of MCMs, requires the integration of geographic, demographic, and transportation data. The design and analysis of these response plans is a complex task. To this end, the RE-PLAN Framework has been developed to facilitate a data-driven response plan design. This talk will provide the highlights of RE-PLAN, a computational framework for placing facilities based on different optimization criteria.

The Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching

Description | Recipients
The Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching is established through a generous endowment provided by Joel and Ruth Spira to recognize, reward and inspire excellence in teaching within and beyond the confines of the traditional classroom by supporting superior performance in undergraduate research instruction. A monetary award is made to the faculty memberâs department for the acquisition of books, journals, or other materials in the honoreeâs field that will enhance teaching.  This provides a lasting benefit not only to the honoree, but also to his or her colleagues and to our students.

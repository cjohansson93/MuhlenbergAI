The Values that Inform our Work
××¦×× ×××××× Bâtzelem Elohim (In the Divine Image): We welcome every student as their whole self, honoring their unique Jewish journeys as we empower their growth as individuals and Jews.
Every human being is created in the image of the divine - Genesis 1:27
×××¨××ª× Chavruta (Relationships): Authentic relationships grounded in respect and kindness are the foundation of Hillelâs work and the basis for facilitating growth, learning and community. Our primary relationship is with students, whom the organization is here to serve. We also value key relationships that advance our mission â with our professional colleagues, our university and organizational partners, and our supporters.
Holiness is found in the space between two people in authentic encounter - Martin Buber
×§×××× Kehillah (Community): Jewish life at its core is a collective experience, encompassing the multifaceted connections that bind us together as a Jewish people. We are committed to creating diverse, supportive, sustaining communities, in which students and professionals can celebrate, explore, learn, take risks and grow. Our commitment to pluralism is strengthened when these communities are given space for active expression in respectful encounter with one another.
Our journeys are personal, distinctive, and unique, but they are not solitary. They do not begin and end with us. We are part of something larger, older, deeper and more enduring than ourselves. - Rabbi Sharon Cohen Anisfeld
××××ª ×¢× ××©×¨×× / ××××ª ×××¨×××ª Ahavat Am Yisrael/Ahavat HaBeriyot (Love of the Jewish People/Love of All Humanity): Our work is informed both by our love of the Jewish people and a commitment to be engaged global citizens dedicated to amplifying the good and repairing the broken in the Jewish community and the world.
How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world - Anne Frank
×ª××¨×ª ×××× Torat Chayim (A Living Torah): Hillel is a learning organization. We ground our work in tradition and cultivate a vibrant Judaism attuned to the ever-changing experiences of students in college. The evolving nature of our work requires us to be self-reflective and to work with a spirit of agility and innovation.
The old shall be made new and the new shall be made holy - Rav Abraham Isaac Kook

Men's Tennis Duo Finishes Third at ITA Regional

The Muhlenberg team of freshman Mickey Schindler and junior Neil Shulman won the B1 doubles
consolation bracket at the ITA Southeast Regional.

Schindler and Shulman played four close matches en route to the third-place finish. After dropping their first match, 9-8 (7-2) to
a Grove City duo, the Mules won three consolation matches by scores of 8-6, 9-7 and 9-7. They saved five match points in the
semifinal match against Penn State Abington, coming from behind after being down 7-4, and fought off three more in the final
against a team from Elizabethtown.

The tandem won the third doubles bracket at the Mule Fall Classic two weeks ago and has a record of 5-1 together.

Schindler (right) also won a singles match in the B2 draw, defeating an opponent who was a former roommate at a tennis camp and now plays for tournament host
Mary Washington. Schindler fell to a Carnegie Mellon player in the quarterfinals.

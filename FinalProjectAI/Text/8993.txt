Phi Alpha Theta is an American honor society for undergraduate and graduate students and professors of history.  The society has over 400,000 members, with some 9,000 new members joining each year through 970 chapters nationwide.  It is a professional society whose mission is to promote the study of history through the encouragement of research, good teaching, publication and the exchange of learning and ideas among historians.

Must have taken at least 4 courses in history
Must have a minimum GPA of 3.1 in History
Must have a minimum of 3.0 GPA overall
Must be in the top 35% of their class. 

The current chapter advisor is Dr. Mark Stein.

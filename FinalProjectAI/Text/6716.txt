Killing Scores 38 as Men's Basketball Picks Up First Conference Win
 Thursday, November 29, 2012







					 

 Women’s basketball


Before every free throw he takes, sophomore Malique Killing wraps the basketball once around his waist before dribbling and shooting.




Killing's 38 points were the most by a Mule in 12 years. It had been 18 years since a Muhlenberg player scored that many at Memorial Hall.



His unique routine works well for him – he was 8-of-9 from the charity stripe tonight as part of a career-high 38 points, leading the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team to a 91-80 victory over Swarthmore.

Killing says he began his free throw routine in middle school.

“I would actually wrap it around three times and dribble five times. I led our team in 10-second violations at the free throw line,” quipped Killing. “I decided to change it up in high school and shot 50 percent from the free throw line, so at the beginning of my college career, I decided to go back to it and shorten it up. Since then, I’ve been over 80 percent.”




Stavetski scored 15 points in the first half on perfect 4-for-4 shooting from the field.



Killing’s free throws weren’t the only thing “Killing” the Garnet. He drained six of 10 shots from behind the arc, including one where he drew a foul and completed a four-point play to put the Mules (3-2, 1-1) up by 15 with 8:53 remaining.

Freshman Alec Stavetski scored 20 points, also a career high, nearly half of them from behind the three-point line. He also converted seven of eight free throws, including two with 10:05 remaining to put Muhlenberg back up by nine. Prior to the free throws, Swarthmore’s seven-point deficit was its smallest since midway through the first half.

The Garnet (0-5, 0-2) actually led for more than eight minutes at the beginning of the game, but the Mules went on 23-2 run near the 11-minute mark and never looked back. Stavetski and Killing combined for 21 of the points.

“The big thing with our team is having positive energy. I think we underestimated this team when we came out. They’re a really good team and they really jumped out on us,” said Killing. “We’re resilient though, and I think that the maturity from our captains really helped us turn it around.”

Senior co-captain Matt O’Hara ran the offense, dishing out eight assists.

Juniors Kevin Hargrove and Brandon Bovino put forth solid efforts for Muhlenberg in the post.

Hargove just missed a double-double, recording nine points and nine rebounds. He also added five blocks. Bovino added a career-high 11 points and grabbed eight boards.

 “I think at this point, everyone understands their roles. Guys come off the bench and do what they have to do to contribute to the team,” stated Killing. “Whether you score 38 points or you score two points, everybody has a role and everybody is embracing that role.”

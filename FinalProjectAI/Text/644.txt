Astronomy Students Put the Sun in Clear View
Muhlenberg Physics students in this semesterâs astronomy course had the opportunity to view solar prominences and sun spots thanks to members of the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Society.  Each semester LVAAS members bring telescopes to campus at the invitation of Dr. Judith Parker, Lecturer of Physics, but the solarscopes were a first this semester. 
 Members of LVAAS and the Muhlenberg community view the sun.
 Three tripods were set up in front of the  Trumbower Science Building on Muhlenbergâs campus.  Each tripod supported two telescopes.  The larger telescope had a âwhite light filterâ mounted onto the front of the tube.  While the filter appeared to be a sheet of ordinary tin foil, it is actually a metal coated polymer material made specifically for solar filters blocking out over 99.999% of the light making it safe for student viewing.  Students were able to see sun spots on the sunâs surface through this scope.   The smaller scope is a dedicated solar telescope that provides a âhydrogen-alpha lightâ view of the sun.  Students were able to observe solar prominences emitted from the sun.  
71 students and their guests signed in and more than an equal number of faculty, staff and curious students passing by were eager to check out the sun.
Muhlenberg Faculty and Students Present at National Conference
Muhlenberg College was well represented at this year's American Physical Society Division of Nuclear Physics Fall meeting held from October 24 to October 27, 2012 in Newport Beach, California.

Muhlenberg Physics students Andrew Nederlof, Ben Schweid, Steve Motchswiller, Nate Crossette, and Kyle Sullivan participated in Kutztown Universityâs 5th Annual Catalobber Contest. Students Alex Isinhue and Matt Moscowitz helped build the âBergâs trebuchet but didn't attend the contest.

The contest was held at Kutztown University on Sunday, April 10th. Seven different teams from five different colleges and universities participated in the event. There were two classes of Cantalobbers, trebuchets and air cannons. Muhlenbergâs entry was a floating arm trebuchet. They placed fourth in field of four with total summed yardage of 116 yards.  The winning trebuchet had a total summed yardage of 660 yards. 
After getting a good look at the substantial competition, an example seen looming in the background of the photo below, the âBerg team readily admits they have more work to do and plan on entering next year competition with a new and improved trebuchet.

A fun video compilation of the event can be viewed via this YouTube link. The video compilation and photos are by Kyle Sullivan.

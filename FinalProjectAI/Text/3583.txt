carter named to all-decade team



Joshua Carter 02 picked up plenty of honors during his time as a football and baseball player at Muhlenberg, and now hes picked up another one nearly 10 years after hanging up his Mule jersey.

Carter recently was named to the D3football.com All-Decade fourth team as a kick returner. 

Carter had a phenomenal career returning kicks and punts for the Mules from 1998 to 2001. He graduated as the Division III record-holder for yards on kickoff returns (2,189, since broken) and yards on punt returns (1,550, still standing). Carters combined total of 3,739 yards on kickoff and punt returns remains the Division III standard.

In 1999, Carter set a national record with 981 yards on kickoff returns and ranked second in Division III with an average of 35.0 yards per return. He brought back five kicks for touchdowns in his career.

Carter, named to the D3football.com All-America first team as a kick returner in both 1999 and 2000, also excelled as a wide receiver and holds the school record for career all-purpose yards (6,642). He was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team five times, three as a kick returner and two as a wide receiver, and was 2000 CC player of the year.

Carter is in good company on the D3football.com All-Decade team. The first-team returner, Larry Beavers of Wesley, played in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints and returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown against the New England Patriots in a 2010 preseason game. The second-team returner, Pete Ittersagen of Wheaton, is active as a cornerback with the Tennessee Titans. And the third-team return man, Blake Elliott of St. Johns, spent time with the Minnesota Vikings.

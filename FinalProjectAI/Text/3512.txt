ON PAGE 2 ... A near-championship
for WOMEN’S TRACK and FIELD
CC CHAMPS!
Women’s Basketball Wins First Title Since
1998



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team scored the final six points of
the game, five by
freshman Lauren Boyle, to defeat Johns Hopkins, 55-50, in the
Centennial Conference championship game.

The win gave the 15th-ranked Mules (25-2) their third CC title (first
since 1998) and an automatic bid to the NCAA Division III Tournament.
Pairings are scheduled to be announced Monday morning and will be posted
on the Web site as soon as they are available.

“I’m overwhelmed, ” said senior center Michelle Hirst,
who hit a key free throw in the last minute. “I can’t really put
it into words. To know the potential of this team, and to finally do it,
it’s just amazing.”

Amazing also describes the ability of Muhlenberg to win close games. For
the fourth time in the last 11 days, the Mules made all the big plays down
the stretch to pull out a win by five points or less.

Muhlenberg squandered an early 11-point lead by going more than nine
minutes without a field goal against a Blue Jay team that came in ranked
fourth in the NCAA in field-goal percentage defense. Trailing 27-25, the





Sam Tager is one of seven seniors who, with a record of 72-32, are now the
winningest class in Muhlenberg women’s basketball history. The classes
of 1999 and 2004 both won 71 games in their four years.



Mules took over following a shot-clock violation with 24 seconds left in
the half. Boyle nailed a jumper with three seconds left to tie the score,
and senior Kristen Piscadlo stole the inbounds pass and beat the
buzzer to give Muhlenberg a 29-27 lead at the break.

The second half featured six ties and six lead changes. Hopkins (20-7)
took its biggest lead, at 38-33, with 13:45 to play. Muhlenberg came back
and scored the next seven points, and neither team led by more than three
points again until the final minute.

The Blue Jays scored their final points with 1:20 remaining to take a
50-49 lead. On the Mules’ next possession, Boyle drilled a line-drive
jumper from the top of the key with 52 seconds left. Hopkins got two shots
to take the lead and missed both, with Hirst fighting to grab the rebound
after the second. She was fouled immediately with 25 seconds on the clock,
and the Blue Jays called timeout to ice her.

“What got me to relax was thinking about four years of shooting free
throws every day at practice,” said Hirst, a 55.6-percent shooter from
the line. “I didn’t even think about the game situation. I
thought, this is practice, and I’m going to do what I do every single
day.”

Hirst did just that, making the front end of the one-and-one to give
Muhlenberg a 52-50 lead. She missed the second, and on the rebound a Blue





Coluccini’s double-double was the fifth of her career.



Jay player kept possession by calling a timeout as she was falling out of
bounds.

Hopkins missed three cracks to tie the game on its possession, and the
ball was batted out of bounds to the Mules with 2.3 seconds left. The Blue
Jays called their last timeout, then fouled Boyle on the inbounds pass.
After she made the first of two shots, Hopkins called another timeout
– which it didn’t have. The technical foul gave Boyle two more
free throws to clinch the game, and she made two of her remaining three.

The championship capped a remarkable comeback for the Mules, a perennial
playoff team until last year, when they dropped 13 of their final 17 games
to finish at 11-14. Picked sixth in the CC preseason poll, they committed
themselves to returning the program to its previous level – and then
some.

“Sometimes you have to go through tough times to know the good
times,” reflected Hirst. &#147At this moment, I can see that [last
year] got us doing everything right. It made us really mentally tough this
year, and at tough times on the court that has pulled us through every
game.&#148
<P>
It also helped to add Boyle, a clutch freshman whose late baskets seem to
be at the heart of every close win. She scored a team-high 16 points in
the championship game. 
<P>
&#147As seniors, [Lauren] is sort of a gift that has been given to
us,&#148 said Hirst. &#147She has incredible heart and a maturity that
I&#146ve never seen in a freshman.&#148
<P>
Senior <B>Stephanie Coluccini</B> also played a big role in a game in
which Muhlenberg&#146s leading scorer was held in check, notching her
first double-double of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds.

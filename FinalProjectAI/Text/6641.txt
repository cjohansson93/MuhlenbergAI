Junior Stephanie Carnevale of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team earned All-America honors by finishing seventh in the
60-meter hurdles at the NCAA Championships, hosted by North Central.

Carnevale, who got into the national meet as the 15th and last qualifier, posted the seventh-fastest qualifying time yesterday, a school-record 8.85, to advance to the
final.

In the final, Carnevale crossed the finish line in 8.95 seconds, a hundredth of a second ahead of the eighth-place finisher.

Carnevale is only the second indoor All-American in Muhlenberg women’s track and field history, and the first junior to accomplish the feat. 
Alex Faust was the other, placing sixth in the pole vault in her senior season of 2010.

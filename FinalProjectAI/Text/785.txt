I Spit on Your Scary Movie: Rape in Horror Movies
In this paper, I examine the progression (or regression) rape scenes inhorror movies over the last 25 years. A qualitative content analysis ofwas conducted 17 horror films featuring rape, chosen for their representativeness, box office gross, and release date. For each movie, I recorded the characterizations of the victim and rapist, the details of therape(s), its visibility/graphicness, its context, and its relation to theoverall plot of the movie were examined. Overall, the sample in thisstudy suggests that rape was more commonplace in horror movies inthe early 1980s. In the mid 1980s and early 1990s, rapes were not fea-tured nearly as much and when they were used, they were usually implied and not shown. In the horror movies of the last decade, however,rape has become much more common, central to the plot, violent andgraphic, according to my sample. Overall, this study concludes that vio-lence towards women, both physical and sexual, is becoming normalized.

Church Relations
As a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), Muhlenberg takes seriously its deep roots with the ELCA and its connections with area congregations.
This is a Two-Way-Street:
Muhlenberg invites you and your congregation to get connected with your church college! Visit, contact us, ask questions, share resources.
Muhlenberg wants to get to know you and your congregation. How can we work together?

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team moved closer to a Centennial Conference playoff berth with a 6-3 home win against Swarthmore, which came in ranked ninth in the Atlantic South Region.

With one CC match left to play, on Saturday at Dickinson, the Mules are in sole possession of the fifth and final playoff spot. Swarthmore and Haverford (both 6-2) play each other tomorrow, and the Garnet still has to face first-place Johns Hopkins. Dickinson is 5-3 with a match against second-place Franklin & Marshall scheduled for tomorrow.

The Mules, ranked 20th in the region, will clinch a berth, and possibly a home playoff match, with a win at Dickinson, but they could be out with a loss.

Muhlenberg grabbed the lead against Swarthmore by winning two of three doubles matches in contrasting styles. Seniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman broke serve early and went on to defeat the ninth-ranked doubles team in the region, 9-7. At No. 2, freshman Sara Finger and junior Sharen Resnikoff breezed to an 8-0 shutout.

Straight-set wins by Resnikoff at No. 5 and junior Jennifer Goldberg at No. 4 extended the lead to 4-1, and Sanders clinched the match with a 6-1, 6-2 victory at second singles.

Szulman (left) provided the final margin by winning 8-5 at No. 3.

Finger played a strong singles match against the 11th-ranked player in the region, a two-time All-CC first-team selection. After dropping the first set, 6-2, Finger rebounded to win at love in the second set before losing the supertiebreaker, 10-6.

Community Update - January 4, 2022




A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg community

Tuesday, January 4, 2022

To the Muhlenberg Community,
I hope you have enjoyed some well-deserved time for rest and renewal with your families over the holidays. As we prepare for the spring semester, we have been closely monitoring the trajectory of the pandemic and the evolution of the more contagious Omicron variant. We remain in regular conversation with our local healthcare advisors regarding current guidelines and continue to prioritize the health and safety of all members of our community. Therefore, we will adapt as necessary as the campus situation or health guidance changes. 
We continue to plan for the start of in-person classes on January 18. Several policies and protocols are in place for the spring semester to support a safe return to in-person learning and work:

Boosters: Students, faculty and staff are required to get a booster by February 1 or within 30 days after becoming eligible to receive the booster. We held multiple vaccine and booster clinics on campus and will offer additional booster clinics in January. However, if you are eligible now, we urge you to get your booster as soon as possible rather than wait until the February 1 deadline.
Pre-arrival Testing: All students, regardless of vaccination status, are required to get a pre-arrival test and upload the result 72 hours before returning to campus. Students have received multiple, detailed communications about this and will receive another email from Dean Williams later today.  
Flu Vaccinations: Students were required to show proof of flu vaccination by December 1. Students cannot move in for the Spring semester without uploading this information. We encourage faculty and staff to also get vaccinated against the flu.
Masking: We will continue to require indoor masking in all public spaces including classrooms, campus buildings and workspaces. Members of our community should expect to strictly adhere to the Collegeâs masking requirements. For the most effective protection against infection, we encourage you to wear KN95 masks. The College will provide two KN95 masks for each student, faculty and staff member on campus at the start of the spring semester. Details of KN95 mask distribution are forthcoming. 
Weekly Testing: Unvaccinated students, faculty and staff will continue weekly testing on campus. In addition, individuals who are identified as close contacts of a campus community member who tests positive or students who are symptomatic will be tested on campus as needed.  

During the fall semester, we had a low number of positive cases on campus. Given the more contagious nature of the Omicron variant, we expect to see an increase in cases compared to the fall. Infectious disease experts and others studying the evolution of COVID-19 have made it clear that this disease will be with us for the long-term. Vaccination, and now boosters, indoor masking and other public health protocols are the best way to minimize infection spread, serious illness and hospitalizations.
We know that members of our community have varied perspectives on how to address the ongoing situation. Some believe College policies are too rigid; others would like to see more stringent policies to limit in-person contact. Our decisions, however, need to be evidence-based and informed by our campus culture and mission. Iâve said many times that we are blessed with a community that cares for one another. As we begin this spring semester, we will need to re-commit to that care with strict adherence to campus protocols. Each member of the community must take responsibility for the collective health and well-being of our campus.
We realize that you may have additional questions. To that end, Dean Williams, Provost Furge and Jill Walsh will be sending communications later today to students, faculty and staff that provide details about residence hall protocols, classroom teaching, and employee policies, respectively. Within the next two weeks, we will offer webinars to further address questions or you may email covid-19@muhlenberg.edu.
I remain proud of the care and support you provide one another. I am confident that together we will continue to grow and thrive as a community.

men’s lax loses another tough one





Siebold's second goal came in a play-on situation after he drew a flag but held on to the ball.




The Muhlenberg men's lacrosse team overcame a 5-3 deficit but lost in the closing seconds, 6-5, to Marywood in its third straight one-goal game to open the season.

Sophomore Alex Ardolino netted the tying goal off a feed from junior Brent Siebold with 1:05 left in the game, concluding a comeback that began with the Mules (1-2) trailing 4-1. But Marywood scored the game winner with 16.6 seconds left for the win.

The Pacers (3-0) tallied two goals just 13 seconds apart in the first quarter to take a 2-0 lead. Muhlenberg was held scoreless the entire first and appeared to be heading into halftime without finding the back of the net before Siebold finally broke through with 58.9 seconds left in the second.

But Marywood managed two devastating goals to end the half, scoring a gift-wrapped goal with 7.4 seconds to play and then netting another as time expired.

The Mules' comeback began by taking advantage of the first penalty of the game, as Siebold tallied an extra-man goal to make the score 4-2 less than four minutes into the third. Roughly two-and-a-half minutes later sophomore Clint Watkins made a great run and scored to cut the deficit to one.

The Pacers responded just over two minutes later, but Watkins scored a crucial goal with 1:16 left in the quarter to again make it a one-goal game. In his first action as a Mule, freshman AJ Diaz nearly netted the equalizer, hitting the far-side post just before the end of the period.

Marywood hit the crossbar midway through the fourth quarter, and, after a turnover-laden stretch for both teams, Ardolino finally scored the tying goal with just over a minute to play. But the Pacers won the ensuing faceoff and tallied the late winner, and Muhlenberg's desperation heave downfield went out of bounds.

Muhlenberg outshot Marywood 38-21 for the game but won just four of 14 faceoffs. Junior Andy Curley picked up five ground balls and caused four turnovers on defense, and senior Matthew Schroeder had a game-high eight ground balls as well as three caused turnovers.

Internships and Course Work in Organic Agriculture
Muhlenberg College has a special relationship with Liberty Gardens, a small organic farm in Coopersburg, PA.  Classes in Biology and Environmental Studies visit the farm for hands-on experiences and learn from farmers, Jeff Frank and Kristin Illick, about various farming techniques, how to increase soil productivity, pest management, crop cultivation, how the national labeling of "organics" affects small farmers, and about how an organic farmer can successfully market his/her products to local consumers, among other things.  There are also opportunties for more intensive internships during the semester and/or summers.  For more information contact Dr. Niesenbaum in the Biology Department.

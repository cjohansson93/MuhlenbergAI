The French Club                                                         Le Cercle FranÃ§ais

Mission The French Club (Le Cercle FranÃ§ais) at Muhlenberg College seeks to promote learning of the French language and culture through activities that encourage greater awareness of French and Francophone cultures around the world. The club organizes activities that allow students to practice French inside and outside of class, as well as to acquaint students with the French language, French and Francophone cultures, histories, and ways of life.  All students, faculty, and staff of Muhlenberg College are welcome to attend activities and join the club.

French Table The French Club meets every Friday during Common Hour from 2:00-3:00 pm for a French conversation table in Seegers Union.  The conversation table is held at the round table in the corner of GQ.  All students, faculty, and community members are welcome to attend, regardless of your level of French. Join us! La Table Français (French Table)

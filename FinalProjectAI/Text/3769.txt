Volleyball slips, field hockey falls





Tiffany Kreider got the Muhlenberg field hockey team on the board for the first time this season with her second-half penalty stroke. 
But it was not enough, as the Mules fell at home, 3-1, to Montclair State.

With one quick swing of Davi Gordon's right arm, Memorial Hall filled with cheers. Gordon's Muhlenberg teammates quickly gathered into a huddle and shouted "Do work."

Gordon's kill had just won the Mules the first set of their final match of the Buttermaker Tournament against Neumann, 25-16.

The Mules were working well and appeared poised to make a run on the Knights. Unfortunately for Muhlenberg, Neumann rebounded to narrowly win each of the next three sets to take the match, 3-1.




Duggan led the Mules with three aces against Neumann.




But it was not without plenty of drama as the two teams exchanged prolonged runs in each set. 

Muhlenberg led by as many as five points in both the second and third sets, before succumbing to Knight rallies.

Caitlin Dombkowski and Jackie Price formed a wall on Muhlenberg's defensive interior, registering five blocks apiece.

That duo also proved to be tough at the service line. Dombkowski's string of seven-straight points put the Mules in control in the first set, while Price's five-point run at the end of the set put the Knights away.

On the back line, libero Brooke McQueen finished with a game- and season-high 18 digs.

Setter Morgan Duggan added a season-high 35 assists for the Mules, while Gordon (13 kills), Price (10 kills) and Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare (9 kills) paced the offensive attack. 

Gordon also landed a spot on the all-tournament team, after finishing with 23 kills and 31 digs in three matches.

Muhlenberg dropped its first match of the day against Moravian, 3-0.

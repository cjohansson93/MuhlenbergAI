About the Finance Program The finance major is offered by the Accounting, Business, and Economics Department. It provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles that underlie the operation and functions of financial markets and the analytical and quantitative skills needed for an understanding of current financial issues, practices, and policies. Additionally, the major prepares students for graduate work in business and finance and careers in banking, insurance, investments, and corporate financial planning. The Accounting, Business, and Economics department supervises an endowed, student run Investment Society.

          Developing my Career in Finance
  








Daniel LakhmanMajor(s): Finance
I started out at Muhlenberg as a pre-med student with the intention of going to dental school. Within a semester I realized that my interests pointed me elsewhere. Throughout high school I had a passion for finance and stocks, which led to my decision to switch to a finance major. Additionally, I joined the investment society in order to try and immerse myself as much as I possibly could within finance. Between classes and the investment society, I learned a great deal, which helped me obtain internships and now full time positions. I currently work at an investment bank and without the knowledge and experiences that I gathered from my 4 years at Muhlenberg, I would have not be able to land my current role, let alone succeed in it. The finance program not only helped me develop my career but it helped me develop as a person and as a professional as well and for that I will always be grateful.

Andrew PorterMajor(s): Finance and Business
I started out going to Muhlenberg as a pre-med student. I soon realized that the medical world was not for me. I found my passion in finance and it has been a great two years of studying the finance world. I am the assistant treasurer of 
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, where I began put my knowledge of finance to use. I am also the business manager of the Muhlenberg Dynamics, an on campus a capella group. My experience at Muhlenberg has allowed me to learn an incredible amount about finance and business, to the extent that I was able to apply it in real world situations. This past summer I had an internship with an online financial literacy company called EverFi, Inc. Not only was I immersed in the finance world, but also I was helping others learn finance and it was great to share some of my knowledge.
The Muhlenberg community has given me the freedom to explore this major and also immerse myself in a wealth of other information including, Japanese cultures and religions, philosophy, literature, art and Spanish too. Being at Muhlenberg means that I can study in my focus but still be able to learn about anything else I'd like. The finance program has taught me not only how to keep my personal finances in order, but has taught me how to run a good business, keep a good grasp on the financial world and understand the nations financial economic standing. I have learned an incredible amount here, and I couldn't be happier with where I am.

David SalzmanMajor(s): Finance and Business AdministrationConcentration in International Business
While at Muhlenberg, I benefited in many ways by choosing a course of study within the Accounting, Business, Economics, and Finance department â specifically as a double major in Finance and Business Administration with a concentration in International Business which was completed while studying abroad as a part of the Maastricht University program through Muhlenberg. Not only was I able to obtain a double major in two practical courses of study, I was also afforded the opportunity to take classes across a variety of other disciplines including significant  coursework in Film Studies and Media & 
Communications. At larger undergraduate business schools, to my knowledge, are not afforded this same opportunity due to a higher number of required courses within the core discipline of study. In addition, I have been able to build meaningful relationships with my professors through spending time together during their office hours, independent studies, or even being able to grab meals together on the weekends and after classes. The conversations and relationships I have made with my professors have great meaning to me as they have helped to teach me to think critically, work smart, and most importantly, differentiate myself from the rest of the pack.   I have taken my Muhlenberg College experience and applied it to my career in the financial services industry. From learning about derivative markets to investment theories to cash flow analysis, my work and time spent at Muhlenberg has helped me to excel in my current role dealing with financial markets on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, as Vice President of the Muhlenberg Investment Society (MIS) â a student-managed portion of the collegeâs endowment with AUM exceeding $400,000.
â I learned the intricacies of portfolio construction and benchmarking, as well as managing a team of âanalystsâ and running bi-weekly meetings to discuss asset allocation. This experience, in combination with studying business practices of foreign countries while abroad, has helped prepare me to work with some of my firmâs most complex clients. With the prospect of a finance lab coming to campus and increasing course selection within the department, I am confident Muhlenberg will continue to attract even more talented students with strong interests in Accounting, Business, Economics and Finance.

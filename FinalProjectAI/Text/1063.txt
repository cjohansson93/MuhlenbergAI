Message to Faculty & Staff from President Harring
Friday, March 13, 2020

Dear Faculty and Staff,
Before I share some information about our planning, I want to thank you all deeply. This has been an incredibly difficult and stressful time. That you have all pulled together to help one anotherâand senior staffâto navigate uncharted territory is not surprising to me. But the manner in which you have collaborated and the degree to which you have helped guide the institution has far exceeded my expectations. Please know that I truly appreciate your ongoing efforts.
The reality is that we are now operating in ways we could not have imagined when the academic year started. And as we begin to consider the impact and uncertainty of unfolding events, we know that concerns of our work and personal lives intersect now more than ever. Schools and daycare facilities could close at any moment. You or someone you live with might be immunocompromised, making it uncomfortable for you to be on campus. We could reach a point where the Allentown Department of Health asks that we do not have any employees on campus beyond those necessary to care for the students remaining with us. Many of the decisions we have made so far are in anticipation of these individual and collective circumstances.
In light of these potential circumstances, Iâm asking us all to begin thinking about what changes might be necessary in how we work during the coronavirus crisis. Area managers and supervisors should begin to have conversations with their staff to develop remote work plans to ensure that we have continuity in our operations. The faculty are already deep into moving our academic program to remote learning and the College is providing training and support for this transition. We will also provide any necessary training for staff to make sure that you have the access you need to successfully work remotely. Youâll receive additional information about this from Human Resources this afternoon.
We already have ZOOM video conferencing services available to help you continue to stay in touch with your campus peers without the need for face-to-face meetings. We are also working on providing Google Hangouts as another option and will share additional information when available. I have no doubt that you will all work together and maintain the high level of service and quality that is the hallmark of the Muhlenberg experience.
One final note: Until things get back to normal operations, we invite all staff and faculty to dress casually during working hours.
Stay healthy,
Kathy

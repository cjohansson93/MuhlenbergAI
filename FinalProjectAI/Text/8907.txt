Academic advising plays an important role in the development of our students beginning with the transition from high school to college and throughout their college experience.  Academic advisors are one of the few sustained relationships with the college and the quality of this relationship is important for student success and engagement. Results from the national 2020 NSSE student survey (see below) of first year and senior year students suggests that the quality of academic advising is crucial to student success and engagement.
While our conversations with advisees change as students move through the curriculum and engage in new opportunities, at the heart of advising are several core conversations that ensure that they are on the right path to graduate and that they have engaged in meaningful conversations about life beyond college.  
As an advisor, you are not expected to know all the ins and outs of every major, minor or program or policy. You are not expected to know all the details about how to petition for an exception to policy, or what happens if a student misses a deadline, but you should know where to find that information. Also, you should be able to direct the student to any resources on campus they need to help them become successful. The aim of this webpage is to provide information that may be useful as you work with your advisees. On the pages that follow, you will find a list of contacts for more information about a wide variety of topics and then specific information about each major and program we offer.
Thank you for your willingness to serve and advise our students!

How to Locate Virtual Student Advisee Files
Class of 2024, 2025 and Transfer student file instructions
All student files will be virtual and accessed through Google Drive.  Having one folder for each student will allow advisors and academic staff to share information or keep some information private, as needed, reduce redundancy and provide a more holistic view of our students. Follow the instructions below to access your adviseesâ files.  If you have any questions, please contact Phedra Henninger at phedrahenninger@muhlenberg.edu.

Launch the Google Drive app (https://drive.google.com/)
Select Shared Drives in the left side panel
For Summer Advising - choose 2021 Summer Advising folder, then choose your folder (e.g. Deegan, Michele), then choose the student's folder
For Orientation and beyond - open the folder named ADV: Last Name, First Name (e.g., ADV: Deegan, Michele)
Advisee folders can found in this shared drive with the naming convention Student Last Name, Student First Name (e.g, Henninger, Phedra)
As a Content Manager of this Shared Drive, you may add additional files and folder and assign rights to individual files on case by case basis

          Advising Guidelines
  








There are many reasons why you or your advisee may decide to meet, including a discussion of their course of study, graduation requirements, post graduation plans, academic or personal challenges, requests for letters of recommendation, to name a few.  As a partner in student success, you play a vital role in information dissemination, providing support and encouragement to your advisee. 

At minimum, you must meet with your advisees prior to registration for the upcoming semester.  However, you donât have to wait for an advisee to initiate a conversation, particularly if you receive a correspondence from the Academic Resource Center or another faculty or staff member who is concerned about your advisee.  An advising schedule will help to ensure that you have good interaction with your advisees.  Possible times to meet with your advisees include:

At the beginning of each semester to review course selections and any changes to their academic plans, new opportunities and reminders about the academic calendar (e.g., drop/add dates, withdraw, internship, study abroad deadlines).


The student is experiencing academic difficulties that are reported by the student, a faculty member, Academic Resource Center staff or the Dean of Academic Life.


Contact students prior to registration to discuss course options and program requirements.

 A studentâs file is confidential, open only to the student and you. It is illegal to discuss a studentâs record with other students. Faculty should not discuss a student's academic situation with a parent/guardian unless the student has given the parent/guardian permission (THIRD PARTY PERMISSION IN WORKDAY) to do so. It is preferrable that you do not talk directly with parents/guardians without consent of the student even with this permission and it is preferable that you engage with the Dean of Academic Life before engaging with a parent/guardian as we want students to learn how to manage difficult situations as independent adults.  
 Allow adequate time for your advising appointment.  First Year student advising  takes longer than for students in other class years.  Pre-registration advising may  take longer for a new major.  A good rule of thumb is to allow for a  minimum of  45 minutes per advising session for a FY student and 30 minutes for other  meetings.
Familiarize yourself with online academic advisor resources found at Academic Advising and, as needed, the our catalog for academic policies catalog.muhlenberg.edu.  Any changes to academic policies during the academic year will be posted on the Dean of Academic Life Advising webpage and on the Office of the Registrar webpage.
  Ensure that you ask a studentâs preferred name and pronouns and share this  information about yourself to your students.
Academic advisers, as are all employees of the college, are required to contact  the Title IX Coordinator if a student shares information related to a sex or gender  based harassment incident including, but not limited to: sexual harassment,  sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, domestic violence, stalking and/or  sexual assault.  Report this information here.
 Make sure your advisee knows about the schoolâs policy regarding academic  integrity. Review the Academic Integrity Code and Procedures.
If your advisee is facing academic challenges you may want to speak with a  member of the Academic Resources Center, Office of Disability Services or the  Dean of Academic Life prior to your meeting with the student. Professionals in  these offices will be able to provide you with some additional information and  support to guide your conversation.
 Discuss plans for study abroad, internships, independent research, possible  summer study or transfer credits. 
You may find yourself talking about non-academic concerns or challenges that  students may be experiencing.  Remember, you are a part of a team of  professionals and you should make recommendations to students to reach out to  appropriate other staff on our campus referral page/or complete an incident report.







          New Advisor Information
  








Whether you are a First Year advisor or an advisor for a major or minor, you play an important role to help students feel connected to our community and all of the rich academic and non-academic resources available to them.  During your first meeting, you will begin to forge an important relationship with your advisee that should develop beyond a conversation about graduation requirements. This page provides information to guide your initial conversations.
Before your first advising appointment:


Class of â22 and â23 hard copy of folders in your departmental office
Class of â24 and â25 are placed in a Google Shared drive in your advising file
Check on studentâs academic progress on Workday or other correspondences from the Academic Resource Center or offices or information in the studentâs folder

Review student virtual files.

Review our catalog for academic policies catalog.muhlenberg.edu and check for any academic policy updates on the Office of the Registrar or Dean of AcademicLife webpages.
Sample Questions for first meeting to help you in getting to know your advisees:

What specific academic areas are of greatest interest to you and why?
How would you describe yourself as a learner?
What was your most rewarding academic experience in high school or at Muhlenberg?
What skills do you hope to develop, improve upon, or refine?
What types of activities/clubs do you plan to (or do) participate in at Muhlenberg?




Generally, your conversations should cover topics about:

institutional policies and procedures

degree requirements
critical dates and deadlines
programs of study


the individual student

core values
aptitudes/interests
strengths/areas for improvement
involvment in extracurricular activities


the future and goal setting

how students visualize their future personal life and career
steps to make this a reality related to their college experiece

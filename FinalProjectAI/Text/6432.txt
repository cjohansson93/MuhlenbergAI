Jones Pitches Softball to Doubleheader Split
 Wednesday, March 14, 2012 - page 3







					 



Freshman Kelsey Jones pitched a four-hit shutout for her first career win to lift the Muhlenberg softball team to a split of its doubleheader at Elizabethtown in its first action since returning from Florida.

The Blue Jays won the first game, 7-3, overcoming a 2-0 deficit by scoring in each of their final three at-bats. But they would do no scoring in the nightcap, thanks to the clutch pitching of Jones (left). Until the last inning, Elizabethtown (8-6) put runners in scoring position only twice, and both times Jones struck out the fourth and fifth hitters to end the threats.

The lineup, meanwhile, provided plenty of support, scoring nine runs on 15 hits. Sophomore Erica Wenzel went 4-for-4 and was in the middle of rallies in all four of her at-bats. She scored runs in the first and sixth and drove in runs in the second and fourth. 

Sophomore Colleen O’Donnell had two hits and drove in two runs, and sophomores Kelly Kline and Chelsea Benjamin and freshman Alyssa Schell also had two hits apiece.

Junior Jessica Costa went 3-for-5 in the doubleheader with a double in each game.

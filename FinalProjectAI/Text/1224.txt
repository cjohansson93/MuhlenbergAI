Dr. Truman L. Koehler
Dr. Truman L. Koehler (1902-1989) was an inspired teacher of mathematics at Muhlenberg College for 45 years, serving 14 years as head of the department. A 1924 graduate of Muhlenberg College, he was a member and served a term as chair of the Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section of the Mathematical Association of America.
He was Muhlenberg's campus director of the Engineering, Science, Management and War Training Program during World War II. In 1954, Dr. Koehler was appointed the Muhlenberg College Center Advisor and the chairman of the Advisory Committee of the nine-college consortium for the Temple University graduate program in education.
He served as president of the Citizens Advising Committee of the Allentown School District, chairman of the local Civil Service Board and a director of Kiwanis and the Gruber Foundations. He also held many leadership positions in the Lutheran church.
The "Truman L. Koehler Professorship in Mathematics" will remain in perpetuity and will provide for the enrichment of one of the basic arts of learning at the College.

The current Koehler Professor of Mathematics is Dr. Linda McGuire.

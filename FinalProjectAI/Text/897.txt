About Me: I'm a NYC native as well as a Muhlenberg alumnus and I am thrilled to be back at 'Berg! Previously, I was a high school educator and coach for 19 years including: girls and boys basketball, football, soccer and track. I enjoy sports, experimenting in the kitchen, playing with my son and exciting dates with my wife.
Advice for Prospective Students: Enjoy the process! Don't be hesitant to ask questions about things that are important to you academically, socially, etc. to make sure the school has the things you're looking for. If possible, talk with as many people on campus as you can and definitely visit the school to envision yourself walking on the campus.
Favorite Food on Campus? My favorite food on campus has to be the breakfast bowls in the General's Quarters and the "Wall of Sweets" in the Wood Dining Commons.

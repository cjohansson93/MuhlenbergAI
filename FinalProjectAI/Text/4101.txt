DiCecilia, Muha named all-CC




A pair of Muhlenberg baseball players were honored by the Centennial Conference.

Senior Joseph DiCecilia was named second-team All-CC at first base, while sophomore John Muha earned honorable mention in the outfield.

Its the second all-conference honor for DiCecilia (left), who was named to the first team last year. He led the Mules in hits (51), doubles (10) and steals (15), and was second in RBI (23). His 51 hits are tied for fourth in the CC, while his 15 steals are the sixth-most in the conference.

DiCecilia, who homered in his final career at-bat, hit .340 for the season and is one of only three players in team history with two 50-hit seasons. He finished his career tied for 21st in school history with 124 career hits and in the top 20 in home runs (t-6th, 12), RBI (t-13th, 80) and doubles (t-17th, 20).

Muha (right),  picked up the first all-conference honor of his career after finishing second on the team with a .352 batting average. He only struck out four times in 91 at bats and finished with a .438 on-base percentage, the best among Mule regulars. Despite missing about a third of the season because of injury, Muha collected 32 hits, 10 RBI and scored 21 runs.

Capstone Projects
 
Perhaps the best demonstration of The School of Continuing Studiesâ cutting-edge approach to learning is the Accelerated Degree program, where teams of students learn collaboratively, bringing a blend of professional and experiential skills to the classroom.
Final or âcapstoneâ projects are required of all groups for graduation and illustrate each cohortâs newly acquired proficiencies. The capstones address a need or problem in the surrounding community.
The following list represents recent capstone projects and demonstrates how School of Continuing Studies students are giving back to the community in which they live and work.

Brenda Dixon Gottschild, Cultural Historian, Author And Performer, Lectures At Muhlenberg College 



Muhlenberg College welcomes Brenda Dixon Gottschild âcultural historian, author and performer â to lecture as a part of the series, The Ethics and Politics of Identity. 


	 Friday, August 26, 2005  01:59 PM

Dixon Gottschild’s talk, “ Reading Race, Performing Race – Parameters and Potentials,” will be held on September 8 at 7 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. A reception will follow the lecture. A week later, on September 15 at 3 p.m. in the Brown Dance Studio, Dixon Gottschild will lead a discussion with attendees to consider generating a "plan of action" for the campus around the issues brought up in her lecture. 
Dixon Gottschild will lead her audience into the process of recognizing the ethical problems that present themselves everyday around the construction and protection of American “whiteness.” She will also explore the corollary societal effect of muting "blackness" in American culture.
Brenda Dixon Gottschild is the author of several books, including: Digging The Africanist Presence in American Performance: Dance and Other Contexts; Waltzing in the Dark: African American Vaudeville and Race Politics in the Swing Era (winner of the 2001 Congress on Research in Dance Award for Outstanding Scholarly Dance Publication); and The Black Dancing Body: A Geography from Coon to Cool. 
She is Professor Emerita of dance studies at Temple University and a senior consultant and writer for Dance Magazine. She performs with her husband, choreographer Hellmut Gottschild, in an innovative form of somatic and research-based collaborative work for which they have coined the term "movement theater discourse."
 The Ethics and Politics of Identity is a year long series of programs, sponsored by the Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics , about the ethical challenges that surround the changing categories of social, national, and global identities.

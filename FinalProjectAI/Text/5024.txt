dickinson knocks out women’s soccer


Homefield did not turn out to be an advantage for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team either.

Just like the men 18 hours earlier, the Mule women fell to Dickinson in the

semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Red Devils scored 

three times in the second half to break a 1-1 tie and went on to win, 4-2, to advance to the CC championship game against Johns Hopkins, a 3-0 winner against Haverford in the second semifinal.

The Mules (12-6) had their seven-game winning streak stopped and will have to wait until Sunday night, when bids to the NCAA Tournament are announced, to see if their season will continue.

Dickinson (15-3-1) struck early, putting a goal on the board just 6:32 into the game. Exactly 10 minutes later, Muhlenberg tied the score when sophomore Nicolette Miller intercepted an attempted clearing pass and beat the Red Devil goalie to the far post.

The game remained 1-1 through the rest of the first half. Dickinson owned a 9-3 advantage in shots through the first 45 minutes, but sophomore Michele Toher made five of her eight saves to keep the score tied.

Dickinson broke the tie by scoring two goals off restarts, one a free kick from near midfield and the other a corner kick, in a 5:32 span of the second half. Another goal with 16:48 to play gave the Devils a commanding 4-1 lead.

Freshman Alyssa Meola knocked in a direct kick from just outside the box with 8:52 left, but it was too late for the Mules to mount a serious comeback.

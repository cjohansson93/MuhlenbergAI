Men's Basketball in Playoffs Despite Loss; Curry Breaks Record

 Men’s lacrosse



Austin Curry’s record-setting marksmanship wasn’t quite enough for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team in a 92-86 defeat at the hands of first-place Dickinson.

Curry matched a career high with seven three-pointers – on just eight attempts – en route to a game-high 23 points. In the process, Curry broke the school record for career triples, which had stood for nearly two decades; appropriately, his third trey pushed him past Ernie Koschineg’s mark of 192, set in 1995.  

Although Dickinson (20-4, 15-2), which received 31 votes in the latest d3hoops.com poll and had already locked up the Centennial Conference regular-season title, earned a season split, the news wasn’t all bad for the Mules. Thanks to Gettysburg’s loss at Franklin & Marshall, Muhlenberg (15-9, 10-7) clinched a return bid to the conference playoffs. 

With only Saturday’s Senior Day contest against Ursinus left on the docket, the Mules trail fourth-place Johns Hopkins by a game and need a win in the regular-season finale, plus a loss by the Blue Jays at Washington College, to bring the first-round clash to Allentown. A Hopkins victory would send the Mules to Baltimore next Wednesday. The teams split the season series, which each winning on its home floor.

Junior Malique Killing scored 17 points and dished out a career-high nine assists with no turnovers for Muhlenberg, which got a career-best 14 points (on 6-of-7 shooting) from freshman Brandon LaRose. Sophomore Alec Stavetski added 12, while senior Kevin Hargrove stuffed the stat sheet with eight points, 10 rebounds, three blocks, three assists and two steals.

Neither team could find a defensive foothold in an up-and-down shootout. Muhlenberg was a sizzling 9-for-18 distance from and finished at 55 percent from the field for the game, but the Red Devils were even better. 

Dickinson shot 57 percent from the field, connecting on half of its 24 attempts from distance. Trailing 44-40 after a first half in which the Mules made 18 of their 29 field-goal attempts (62 percent), the Red Devils gained the upper hand with a 12-1 run that gave them a 62-53 lead with 13:22 to play. Muhlenberg got as close as three (64-61) on twisting scoop shot by LaRose with 11 minutes remaining, but Dickinson scored the next seven points to open up a double-digit lead and held on from there.

2009-10 year in review, part 1




Although the 2009-10 school year did not result in any Centennial Conference championships for Muhlenberg, it still produced many memorable and historic performances. 
Over the next three days, we’ll take a look back at the year that just finished by presenting awards for many of the year’s top teams, athletes and events.
The review will culminate on Wednesday with awards for athletes of the year and teams of the year, as well as our first video year in review.

Part 1 includes streaks, sisters and senior stars. Watch the slideshow by clicking the logo at the right, and check back tomorrow for Part 2!

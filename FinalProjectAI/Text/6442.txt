Kline Ties Records in Softball Loss

Despite a record hitting display by sophomore Kelly Kline, the Muhlenberg softball team dropped a pair of games on its second day of
competition in Florida.

The Mules lost to Lebanon Valley, 5-0, and Misericordia, 5-4 in eight innings to drop to 1-3 in their season-opening stretch of four games in 21 hours.

Of the 12 hits by Muhlenberg in the two games, Kline (left) had half of them. She went 4-for-4 with two doubles and two home runs in the Misericordia game,
tying school single-game records for home runs (achieved three times previously), extra-base hits (once), total bases (once) and hits (many times).

After singling in her final two at-bats of the Lebanon Valley game, Kline doubled to lead off the second against Misericordia. She was thrown out trying to score
on a ground ball, but made sure that wouldn’t be a problem her next two times up, as she trotted around the bases after hitting home runs.

Kline has three home runs this season, matching her total from all of last year. Just four games into her sophomore campaign, she is already tied for second on
Muhlenberg’s all-time home runs list.

Kline’s second blast tied the game at 2-2 in the sixth, and the game remained knotted through seven. Playing by international tiebreaker rules, the
Mules began the eighth with sophomore Erica Wenzel on second. She stole third and scored the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly by junior Devon Barber.

After a walk, Kline drove in an insurance run on a double.

The Cougars spoiled Kline’s big day by scoring three times (on a two-run homer and bases-loaded error) to win in the bottom of the eighth.

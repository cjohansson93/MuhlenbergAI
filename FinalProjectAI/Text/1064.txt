Message to Students from Housing & Residence Life
Wednesday, March 11, 2020






THE PURPOSE OF THIS EMAIL IS TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM ALL STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR HOUSING AND TRAVEL PLANS SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  
As per President Harring's email, all students are expected to depart campus this Saturday, March 14th. Please note the halls will close at 2pm and you must depart by this time. Residential card access will be turned off at 2pm on Saturday for anyone who is not approved to stay past that time. 
ALL students (on or off campus) must complete this form by 3pm, Thursday, March 12th. **Presidential Assistants - You will receive a separate email and do not need to complete. 
For students commuting, living off campus, or in the ATO house, if you will be coming to campus for any reason (including meals) you still must request and be approved through this form.
You may request to stay if you are a:

Student whose home address is more than 300 miles from campus (including international students)
Student whose permanent address is Muhlenberg College
Student without access to internet or technology at home
Student with an extenuating home, family, or financial circumstance 
Students whose home address is in a local area within their state that is significantly impacted by COVID-19

Students seeking financial assistance can submit their request via this form.
Housing processes will continue as scheduled, but you must check your email to receive details. MILE Lottery will take place digitally and will be extended to a two night process Wednesday, April 1st and Thursday, April 2nd. We will also host a digital info session before MILE lottery to go over how the process will work. 
Please make sure that your two factor authentication is set up before you leave campus so that you will be able to check your email and access important information in Google Drive.
Please remember:


Per Dean Gulatiâs email, you are not required to move everything out of your room at this time.


Make sure to follow these check out instructions:





ALL trash is discarded in proper receptacles and dumpsters (please do not use bathroom trash cans).


ALL recycling bins are emptied, cleaned, and left in the room.


Personal fridges should be cleaned, defrosted, unplugged and left open to avoid molding. Large kitchen fridges should just have all perishables removed, but do not unplug.


You do not have to empty your room of all personal items, however, we encourage you to take as much as you are able to easily.  You MUST take home anything you could potentially need for the next 30 days as you will not be allowed back on campus or in the residence halls during the closing;



Thermostats should be set to 65 or low heat. 


Shut and lock all doors and windows before leaving. 


For MILE residents, trash and recycling must be taken out on Thursday night and the receptacles need to be put away Friday morning.



We will lift the visitor policy for this Saturday only during the move out time to assist with helping students depart from campus. If a visitor meets any of the criteria below they CANNOT come to campus:

Have had a known direct exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19;
Have been instructed to isolate or self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms;
Have been notified by someone that you might have been exposed to COVID-19 directly;
Have a fever, cough or shortness of breath;
Have visited a travel warning Level 3 country.

Thank you and safe travels,
Housing & Residence Life

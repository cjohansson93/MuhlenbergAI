Softball Defeats Drew in Walkover in Opener

Baseball, Women’s Tennis Fall


The Muhlenberg baseball team saw its four-game Centennial Conference winning streak come to an end with a 13-5 setback at the hands of Ursinus.

The Mules (11-11, 4-3) found themselves behind the eight ball from the get-go in a battle of teams that came in tied for second in the conference. The Bears (13-8, 5-2) scored five runs in the top of the first and four more in the sixth en route to opening up a 12-1 lead and completing the season sweep.

Junior Jimmy Cody had two hits, including a double, for the Mules. Classmate Kurt Johnson added a 
two-run double during a four-run eighth inning. 

Another junior, Tommy DeVito, singled to lead off the ninth for the first hit of his career.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team had its three-match winning streak snapped with a 7-2 loss to regionally ranked Haverford.

Freshman Jamie Rosenblum recorded her third consecutive 6-0, 6-0 shutout for the Mules’ lone singles win. 
At third doubles, she teamed with junior Jennifer Goldberg to win a much closer match, one that went to a tiebreak at 8-8. (corrected 4/10)

Despite a sharp breeze, it was a nice spring day to go for a walk in the park. And that’s precisely what the Muhlenberg softball team did in the first game of its doubleheader
against Drew.

The Mules drew 12 walks, included free passes to seven of the first 10 batters, en route to defeating the Rangers, 9-0. Drew came back to take the nightcap, 4-1.


Muhlenberg (17-5) scored five runs on only two hits in the first inning. After the first two batters walked, senior Kelly Kline tripled down the
line past first base. Sophomore Taylor Trifiolis followed with a single up the middle for a quick 3-0 lead.

Three consecutive walks brought in another run, and after a double play, two more walks plated the fifth run of the inning.

That was more than enough support for junior Heather Porrini, who pitched a four-hitter for her second straight shutout. Her bid for back-to-back
no-hitters was thwarted in the second, but the Rangers (13-9) never got a runner past second base. Porrini did not walk a batter and struck out two in improving
to 7-3 on the season.

The Mules added four runs in the second, which began with Kline breaking the school record for career doubles. Her 37th two-bagger was a ringing line drive to center.

Juniors Jaimie Klotz and Alyssa Schell (left) had RBI singles in the inning, as did sophomore Alexis Giovinazzo.

The game was the fifth this year that the Mules ended short of the regulation seven innings due to the eight-run rule.

The second game was the opposite story, as Muhlenberg did not draw a single walk. The Mules had their first 11 batters retired and scored their lone run in the bottom of the
seventh on an RBI single by freshman Courtney Simon.

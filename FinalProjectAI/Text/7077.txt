Soccer Teams on Wrong End of 2-1 Games
 Wednesday, October 2, 2013 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team nearly dug itself out of a big hole, but a late goal wasn’t enough 
in a 2-1 loss at nationally ranked Swarthmore. 

Junior Lance Dotzman scored his fifth goal of the season in the 74th minute, heading the ball to the far post off a long 
throwin by classmate Joe Adams to pull Muhlenberg (5-5, 1-2) to within 2-1. 
The Mules, playing their second consecutive undefeated and ranked Centennial Conference opponent, managed two more shots down the stretch, 
but neither was on goal and Swarthmore (6-0-3, 2-0-1) remained unbeaten.



The Garnet, ranked 15th in Division III, took a 1-0 lead in the 25th minute and doubled its advantage in the 57th. 
That was just enough for Swarthmore to hold on in a game in which both squads finished with 11 shots and five shots on goal.

Adams’ assist was his first of the season, and the second of his career.

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team couldn’t hold on to an early lead and dropped a 2-1 decision at DeSales.

Freshman Abby Lazofsky put the Mules (4-5-1) on top just over 10 minutes in, 
latching on to a centering pass (right) from sophomore Nicole Karsch and directing it off her shoulder and into the 
bottom right corner of the net for her third goal of the season. The assist was the third of the season for Karsch, who now has five for her career. 
 
DeSales, however, found an equalizer in the 30th minute and netted the game-winner in the 72nd.

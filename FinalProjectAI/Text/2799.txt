Senior Ryan Foster of the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team was named Centennial Conference player of the week.

Foster averaged 18.5 points and 7.5 rebounds to lead the Mules to a pair of important CC wins that left the Mules tied for second place, a game out of first, with three
weeks to go in the regular season. He scored Muhlenberg’s first 13 points against Haverford, giving the Mules a 13-2 lead they never lost in a 66-55 victory, and hit a 
three-pointer at the beginning of overtime to put the Mules ahead for good in an eventual 73-68 win at McDaniel. 

In the two games, Foster shot 50 percent (6-for-12) from three-point range and added five assists and four blocked shots. He surpassed the milestone of 150 career three-pointers
in the McDaniel game.

For the season, Foster is second on the Mules and 11th in the CC in scoring, averaging 12.6 points per game. He is third in the CC in three-pointers per game (2.11) and
fifth in free-throw percentage (.808). Foster also is tied for the Muhlenberg lead in steals (13) and ranks third on the team in rebounding (5.1 per game), assists (32)
and blocked shots (12).

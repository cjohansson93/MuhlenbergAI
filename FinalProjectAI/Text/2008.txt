“Muhlenberg College has always been vigilant about its finances,” said Kent Dyer, the College’s chief business officer and treasurer. “We are pleased to receive this recognition from a highly respected third party.”
According to Moody’s, the A1 rating reflects the strength of Muhlenberg’s unrestricted liquidity position, which provides a good coverage of debt and enhances operating flexibility. The rating favorably incorporates the College's consistently healthy operating performance evidenced by strong operating margins, cash flow and debt service coverage.
Moody’s also confirmed that the financial outlook for the College is stable. Read more on the Moody’s website.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education and public health.

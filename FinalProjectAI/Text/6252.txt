Women's Tennis Gives Andrews Milestone Coaching Win
 Sunday, April 15, 2012







					 

 Men’s tennis





Andrews was the 2011 Centennial Conference coach of the year.



Linda Andrews joined the Century Club. Again.

As coach of the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team from 1983 to 1999, Andrews compiled a record of 100-98 in spring dual matches. After two years away, she returned to the helm in 2002, and 10 years later,
an 8-1 win at McDaniel gave her a record of 100-57 in her second stint.

Andrews is only the second female (along with former softball coach Ruth Gibbs) in College athletic history to record 200 wins in a sport.

“It’s a huge honor [to be a part of her 200th win],” said junior captain Amanda von Taube. “It’s kind of hard to comprehend; 200 wins is a huge accomplishment. 
I think we’re all really excited to be a part of it.”


Win No. 200 was an important on for the Mules (5-6, 5-4), who are in the hunt for their second consecutive Centennial Conference playoff berth. They are currently in sixth place in the CC with one match to play. 
A win Saturday at Dickinson would guarantee them no worse than a tie for the fifth and final playoff spot.


The victory against the Green Terror came with a modified singles lineup, as No. 1 player Nina Sanders sat out after winning her doubles match. Everyone moved up a spot, with sophomore
Emily Szulman playing No. 1 for the first time in her college career and winning, 6-3, 6-3. Senior Lauren Wink (left) stepped in at No. 6 and picked up her first
career win, 6-0, 6-2.

Along with Szulman, freshman Jennifer Goldberg and sophomore Gabriela Contino won at both doubles and singles. All the Mules captured
their singles matches in straight sets, enabling the team to enjoy a postgame celebration with a card and flowers for their coach.


“Coach Andrews is a lot of fun,” said von Taube. “She’s someone we all get along with. And she definitely understands our team and how we work, so when we go out there, she always has positive words of advice. She never gets down on us and is really helpful during our close matches, giving us words of encouragement.


“I started playing with her my freshman year, and she’s always been there for me, even as a freshman. She is always looking out for every member of the team and definitely considers each player as an individual and knows how we all work in our own styles.”

Application for Faculty Study






Faculty members are encouraged to carefully schedule the use of faculty studies in order to provide all 
                researchers in the Muhlenberg community an opportunity during active research periods. Should the eligible number 
                of applicants exceed the available studies, the Library Committee may ask persons to share a study if such an assignment 
                is compatible with their schedules and working habits.

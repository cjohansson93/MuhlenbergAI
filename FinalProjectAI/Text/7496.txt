Softball Makes History, Needs Three Wins for Championship

The three seniors on the Muhlenberg softball team became the winningest class in College athletic history with their 99th victory, a 2-1 defeat of Washington College in the opening round of the Centennial Conference playoffs.


To win the CC championship, they’ll have to get to 102.

The Mules lost to Haverford, 8-5, in their second game to fall into the loser’s bracket. They will play McDaniel in an elimination game tomorrow at 10:00, with the winner needing to defeat Haverford twice to claim the title.

Kelly Kline, one of the members of the record-setting senior class, also made some personal history, collecting three hits in the two games to tie the school record of 182 career hits.

Kline (right) got Muhlenberg (24-12) off to a good start with a two-out double down the left-field line in the first inning against Washington. The next batter, sophomore Taylor Trifiolis, singled up the middle to plate Kline with the game’s first run.

Those were the only two hits the Mules would get until the sixth inning, but they managed to extend their lead in the third. After a leadoff walk to sophomore Alexis Giovinazzo, the Washington pitched threw late to second base on a sacrifice bunt, giving Muhlenberg two on and nobody out. After a bunt and intentional walk to Kline, Trifiolis brought Giovinazzo home with a sacrifice fly. 


The Shorewomen threatened to tie the game in the sixth on a double with two runners on base, but junior Alyssa Schell (left) fielded the ball at the fence in left and relayed to Giovinazzo, whose throw home cut down the tying run.

After Washington put the tying run on base with a leadoff single in the seventh, the next batter hit a check-swing line drive to first, where Kline snagged the ball and stepped on the base for a timely unassisted double play.

Junior Kelsey Jones allowed seven hits and no earned runs to pick up her 13th win of the season. 

The win gave the Muhlenberg senior class a four-year record of 99-56-1, breaking a tie with the softball Class of 1992 for the most wins by a Muhlenberg team in a four-year period.

The defending champion Shorewomen went on to lose their next game, 2-1 on an eighth-inning walkoff to McDaniel, ensuring that there will be no repeat CC champion. The last CC softball team to win back-to-back titles was Muhlenberg in 2000 and 2001.

Haverford scored three runs in each of the first two innings of the second game to put Muhlenberg in an early hole. Kline’s 30th career home run, a long shot to straightaway center, put the Mules on the board in the fourth, but the Fords tacked two runs on to their lead in the bottom of the fifth. In fact, Haverford could have ended the game right there by bringing home a runner from third base, but Jones, pitching in relief, got the final out to give Muhlenberg a shot at a big comeback.

It almost happened. Kline’s record-tying 182nd hit, a single, ignited a three-run sixth. In the top of the seventh, Trifiolis drove in her fourth run of the day with a single, and the Mules got the tying runs on base, loading the bases with one out. That was as close as they got, though, as the game ended on a popout and lineout.

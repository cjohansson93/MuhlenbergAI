Two womens lax players named all-cc  





Senior Amanda McGovern and junior Danielle Rosen of the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team were named to the All-Centennial Conference second team.

McGovern (left) earned second-team honors for the third straight season after scoring a career-high 69 points. She led the Mules with 26 assists and 34 draw controls, was second with 43 goals and third with 33 ground balls. McGovern ended the regular season tied with Rosen for second in the CC in points per game and was fourth in assists per game and sixth in goals per game.

McGovern scored at least one goal in the final 34 games of her career, the second-longest goal-scoring streak in Muhlenberg history. She finished her career second in school history in points and in the top five in goals, assists, hat tricks and draw controls.

Rosen (right) earned All-CC honors for the first time, also after netting a career-best 69 points. She led the Mules with 50 goals  tied for the fourth-highest total in school history  and added 19 assists, second on the team. Rosen ended the regular season second in the CC in points and goals per game and eighth in assists per game. She recorded 11 hat tricks, the third-most in a single season in school history.

The 69 points scored by both McGovern and Rosen rank third on Muhlenbergs single-season list.

When the Gettysburg football team scored the tying touchdown on a fake field goal with 9:29 left in the fourth quarter, groans aplenty came from the Muhlenberg fans. 

“How could you let that happen?” one said in disbelief.




Gimbar is the first defensive player to score an offensive touchdown for the Mules since 2005.



Seven minutes later, it was the Bullet faithful who were wondering how that could happen. Junior Joe Carlucci threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to sophomore Ian Gimbar on the Mules’ fake field goal with 2:32 left for the go-ahead score in a thrilling 35-31 win against the previously undefeated Bullets.

The wild game featured more than 800 yards of total offense, including the two fourth-quarter touchdowns on fake field goals. It was the Mules’ first game in 10 years in which both teams topped the 30-point mark. It was also Muhlenberg’s third win since 2005 on a touchdown pass off a fake kick in the fourth quarter.

Senior Terrence Dandridge rushed for 145 yards and three first-half touchdowns for Muhlenberg (4-2, 3-2) against a Gettysburg team that entered the game fourth in Division III in scoring defense, having allowed just 41 points in its first five games. 




Sophomore tight end Michael Long caught this pass for 14 yards on a third-and-2 to extend the Mules' second touchdown drive. Muhlenberg was 12-of-23 on third down
and 3-of-3 on fourth down in the game.



The Bullets (5-1, 4-1) came back from a 21-7 halftime deficit to tie the score in the third quarter, but the Mules went back on top 28-21 on the third play of the fourth quarter when senior Dan Deighan found classmate Isaiah Vaughn over the middle from 19 yards out on third-and-9.

Gettysburg faced fourth-and-goal from the 11 on its next drive and sent out its field goal unit. But Kody Smith, the holder and starting quarterback, threw to a wide-open receiver in the back of the end zone to tie the score back up at 28.

An interception near midfield on the next possession set up the Bullets to take their first lead on a 28-yard field goal with 5:43 on the clock.

Muhlenberg had a fourth-and-7 at the Gettysburg 15 on its next drive and set up for a potential game-tying field goal. But Carlucci, the holder and Mules’ backup quarterback, threw to Gimbar in the left flat, and the linebacker, who also recorded two sacks in the game, ran untouched into the end zone.

A 34-yard scramble by Smith on the ensuing possession set the Bullets up at the Muhlenberg 34. But Smith was called for intentional grounding while getting sacked by sophomore Jeremey Thomas, putting Gettysburg in a long-yardage situation. On third-and-11, Smith scrambled away from pressure and heaved the ball to the left sideline, where junior cornerback Darnell Davis wrestled the ball away from the intended receiver with 39.9 seconds left for a game-sealing interception.

Deighan passed for 161 yards for Muhlenberg, completing 13 of 26 passes. Sophomore Tyler George caught three passes for 56 yards, including a 22-yard catch on third-and-10 on the game-winning touchdown drive and a 27-yarder on third-and-12 on another scoring drive.

Sophomore Greg DeLade made a team-high nine tackles, while Thomas notched 3½ tackles for loss. In addition to his interception, Davis recorded six tackles, including two for losses, recovered a fumble and broke up a pass.

IJCU Sponsors Youth and Prejudice Conference for Middle School Students



The Muhlenberg community will welcome over 350 middle schoolers from throughout the Lehigh Valley and beyond for the spring Youth and Prejudice: Reducing Hatred Conference on April 30 from 9:15 a.m. â 1:30 p.m.  


	 Monday, April 29, 2013  10:02 AM

The day, sponsored by the Institute for Jewish-Christian Understanding (IJCU), will begin with a student directed and led play called "The Library," students will hear the stories of survivors or individuals connected with the Holocaust, and then move into small-group dialog that will deepen their awareness and historical understanding of prejudice and hatred.  
For 17 years, the Institute for Jewish-Christian Understanding and the entire campus community have supported this event to raise awareness and inspire students to stand-up against prejudice throughout their schools and communities. 
Muhlenberg College established the IJCU as an expression of its commitment to interfaith relations. The IJCU uses the resources of the academic community to foster such research and dialogue and to build bridges of understanding between the faith traditions.

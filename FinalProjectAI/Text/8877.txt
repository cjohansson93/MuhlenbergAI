Any and all medical services provided at Health Services is strictly confidential.   Any student requesting information to be released to others, including but not limited to parents, faculty, administration, etc., must sign an authorization to release information.
There are legal limits to confidentiality, such as:

Evidence of clear and imminent danger of harm to self or others may require Health Services to report this information to the authorities in an effort to ensure the safety of yourself or others.
Muhlenberg College nurses and physicians are Mandated Reporters as defined under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), Section 6311 and are, therefore, required to report suspicions of abuse and/or neglect of children.
A court order, issued by a judge, or a subpeona may require the releasing of information contained in our records.

Notice of Privacy Policies and Procedures The Notice of Privacy Policies and Procedures describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed (shared) and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully.

When you first enroll at the School of Continuing Studies, you will be assigned an Academic Advisor. Once you have declared a major you will be assigned a Faculty Advisor in that major.
The role of an Advisor is to help students with choices about programs, courses, instructors, class schedules and general academic counseling.Although students ultimately determine their own academic path, Advisors serve as mentors who will suggest, encourage, interpret and guide.
I would like to schedule an advisement meeting.
If you have any additional questions or would like to speak with an academic advisor, please contact us at 484-664-3300 or continuingstudies@muhlenberg.edu.

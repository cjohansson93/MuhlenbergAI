Mens lax wins by  what else?  one 


After five of its first six games this season were decided by one goal, it appeared the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team was on its way to a blowout  by its standards, that is  against Swarthmore.

But the Garnet kept the one-goal madness going, scoring a meaningless goal with 0.2 seconds left in a 9-8 Muhlenberg win.

Its frustrating, but you have to do what it takes to win and gut it out, said senior Al Carpetto of the never-ending one-goal contests. It would be nice to get a comfortable lead and win by four or five.

Comfortable or not, the victory helped the Mules (4-3, 3-1) keep pace in the ultracompetitive Centennial Conference. Previously unbeaten Ursinus fell to McDaniel, also by a score of 9-8, putting Muhlenberg into a tie for second place with the Bears. Top-ranked and first-place Gettysburg lost to No. 3 Salisbury, 11-10, in non-conference action.

Its a big step for this program, commented Carpetto. Its great to be 3-1 for the first time, and were hoping to keep going and get a good seed for the playoffs.

It was a Carpetto feed that helped the Mules seal that 3-1 start. With Muhlenberg leading 7-6 late in the fourth quarter, Carpetto set up shop behind the net and found freshman Jack Reilly wide open in front. Reilly buried his first career goal with 3:20 to play, and freshman Michael Carpetto, Als younger brother, won the ensuing faceoff to help run clock.

Swarthmore (1-6, 0-4) would eventually pull to within one with 34.6 seconds left, but Reilly again made it a two-goal game with 24.7 to play, taking a pass from junior Brent Siebold and finding the back of the net, effectively squashing any chance of a comeback.

Its a big step from high school to college, noted the elder Carpetto. Its nice to see the freshmen do well.

Another of those freshmen helped the Mules play one of their finest quarters of the season in the beginning of the game. After sophomore Clint Watkins put Muhlenberg up 1-0, freshman AJ Diaz netted his first career goal 34 seconds later. Al Carpetto then found sophomore Corey Aferiat, giving the Mules a huge 3-0 lead in the first.

The Garnet did get a goal a few minutes later, but junior Mike Horowitz made sure the quarter would end with the score 3-1. He made two huge saves with Muhlenberg man-down with just under four minutes to play, then made another big stop after another Mule penalty.

Watkins made it 4-1 early in the second, but Swarthmore hung tough, eventually tying the score at 5-all with 41.3 seconds left in the third quarter despite some more remarkable saves from Horowitz, including one at point-blank range just before the half.

After the Garnet tied it Siebold came through with a remarkable play of his own, spinning and firing for the go-ahead goal with 2.5 seconds left in the third. Senior Ari Jacobson then topped that, intercepting a pass from the goalie and beating him one-on-one early in the fourth. Swarthmore wouldnt get closer than one the rest of the way.

They always give us a good fight, said Carpetto. They took us to two overtimes last year and pushed us to the brink again this year. But we got it done.

Horowitz finished with 13 saves between the pipes. Junior Tom Brant had a team-high five ground balls, and he and classmate Andy Curley caused two turnovers each.

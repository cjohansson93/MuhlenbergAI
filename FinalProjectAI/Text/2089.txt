Sheena Sood, Ph.D. 
Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology
Background:
B.A. Sociology and International Studies, Emory University, 2007 M.A. Sociology, Temple University, 2013Ph.D. Sociology, Temple University, 2019
Sheena Sood is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology at Muhlenberg College. As a holistic educator, Sheena invites students to participate in learning as an embodied experience, sometimes through breath and movement and also through engaged pedagogy. She is excited to teach a variety of courses this year, including Introduction to Sociology, Social Movements, Protest and Conflict, and Sociology of Yoga, a signature course she plans to curate for the Spring 2022 semester.
Her early research looked at South Asian American political groups in the Northeast US and used one-on-one semi-structured interviews and participant observation to examine how they engaged in political action and social justice advocacy. Sheenaâs newer research project brings a critical lens to the practice and popularity of yoga. This project, âOmwashingâ Yoga: Weaponized Spirituality in India, Israel, and the US considers the ethical implications of yoga and mindfulness programs being routinely and increasingly used by authoritarian, nationalist regimes and law enforcement institutions around the globe. She is published in peer-reviewed journals, and also has a budding presence in the popular press, including as a guest on the Conspirituality podcast. 
She is actively engaged in healing and racial and economic justice movements in Philadelphia, where she resides, and is a mama to a beautiful shiba inu puppy named Korra! Sheena is excited to join the Muhlenberg community and canât wait to meet more students.

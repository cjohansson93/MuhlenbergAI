Explore your art while you explore the world!
Study abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity â a way to experience some corner of the world deeply and profoundly, while also enhancing your artistic skills and understanding. We strongly encourage you to take advantage of one of the Department's excellent Study Abroad partnerships. More than half of theatre and dance majors do, and when they come back, they can't stop talking (sometimes in Italian!) about what a spectacular, life-altering experience they've had.

Accademia dell'Arte, Tuscany, Italy
With its focus on theatre, music, and dance, the Accademia dell'Arte offers a unique opportunity to study in an intense studio setting, with outstanding artists and professionals from Europe and the United States. Those who come to study at the Accademia will experience an intensive Italian language and cultural immersion program, academic studies, and high-level theatre, music and dance performance training.
Students live near each other in the villa, sharing meals with their teachers. The atmosphere is relaxed but very focused. The medieval city of Arezzo is about a mile away, and on weekends, students venture through Tuscany and take train trips throughout Italy and beyond.
The Dance Program features in-depth study of several genres of dance, ranging from ballet to modern to somatic practices, as well as Italian dance forms and butoh. The curriculum has been carefully designed in consultation with Director of Dance Karen Dearborn to complement Muhlenberg's dance major.
Working closely with the TerÃ¬aca dance group and Giorgio Rossi, founder of the internationally acclaimed dance company Sosta Palmizi, students experience dance training that takes them into the ancient and contemporary cultural fabric of Italy and the Mediterranean. TerÃ¬aca is well known for its research into the roots of Italian popular dance. Rossi, teaching modern dance technique and choreography, is a nationally acclaimed performer, widely noted for his highly personal dance style.
In addition to their core studio classes, students participate in intensive workshops in diverse movement and dance forms. They also take a working excursion to Naples, attend numerous professional performances, and present their own work both in-house and in the local Italian community.
Find out more on the Accademia dell'Arte website.

Other International Programs
Muhlenberg offers a wide range of other study abroad opportunities through its Global Education Program, all of which are available to dance majors. Our students have traveled all over the world, including Ireland, Argentina, Denmark, Ghana, India, Israel, and Nepal.
Your academic advisor will help you to plan a course of study for your semester abroad that allows you to fulfill all your academic requirements. The sooner you start discussing your plans, the better.

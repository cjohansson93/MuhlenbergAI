Name: Christine M. Ingersoll
Department: Chemistry
General Statement of Expertise:
My research is in the diverse field of analytical chemistry, from sample preparation to quantitative analysis of real samples. Recently, my work has focused on the development of automated methods for extraction and analytical sample preparation using robotic workstations. To date we have developed automated methods for the extraction of capsaicins from pepper sauces, parabens from lotions, and antioxidants from red wine prior to chromatographic analysis. We have also gained a fundamental understanding of the advantages of automated techniques in terms of reproducibility, extraction recoveries/efficiency and time. I have experience with a wide range of instrumentation including fluorescence and molecular absorption spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis.
Description of role in this project:
In this project, we will develop analytical methods for the extraction and analysis of chemical compounds with suspected links to herbivory, defense and light environment. Specifically, volatile leaf constituents will be extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-volatile chemistries will be investigated by liquid chromatography.

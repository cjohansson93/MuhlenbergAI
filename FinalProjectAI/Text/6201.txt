Chili Breaks All-Time Scoring Record in Women's Basketball Win
 Saturday, January 7, 2012







					 


 Men’s basketball


No question about it, Alexandra Chili is a scorer. She has been throughout her four years at Muhlenberg, so much so that she has now scored more points than anyone in the school’s women’s basketball history.

But she also is so much more, and all her talents were on display in the 10th-ranked Mules’ 77-64 win at McDaniel.

Chili broke Felicia Perryman’s 19-year-old record on a three-pointer from

the top of the key with 11:37 left in the second half. She scored 28 points in the game, running her career total to 1,695.

Her most memorable play, though, was a crowd-pleasing behind-the-back pass she threw to junior Alita Zabrecky for a fast-break layup late in the first half.

Chili added five rebounds, a team-high four assists, three steals and a blocked shot to her scoring total, overshadowing a career-high 21-point performance by junior Kate Clawson.

“Oh, I don’t mind. I’m happy for Chili. She deserves to get the recognition,” said Clawson. “She’s honestly a great team player. She has great

court vision and can make passes that no one else on our team can.

“And the fact that she can shoot the lights out doesn’t hurt.”

Chili shot the lights out in the first half, going 6-for-9 from the field to score 18 points, just five away from breaking the record. The Mules (11-0, 6-0) led 42-30 at the half, but might have lost their focus coming out of the locker room, as the Green Terror (7-5, 4-4) opened on a 14-0 run to take a two-point lead.

The game was tied at 46 before Chili’s baseline layup with 13:06 left gave Muhlenberg the lead for good. After an exchange of baskets, Chili hit her record-breaking three to put the Mules up by five.

“I’m definitely excited to break the record, and I’m happy [the points] came in an important game rather than in a blowout game where we’re not challenged,” she said.

Chili added to her record total with another three-pointer on the next possession, upping the lead to eight, but McDaniel closed to within three on three separate occasions, the last at 62-59 with 6:28 left.

The Mules then went on a 12-0 run to put the game away, holding the Green Terror scoreless for more than five minutes.

The run started with a five-point possession. Sophomore Leeann Lanza passed the ball out to Clawson for a foul-line jumper, then was fouled while battling for rebounding position. Off the inbounds pass, Clawson was fouled while driving for a layup, and she made both the basket and the free throw.

Lanza finished with 11 points and a career-high 13 rebounds, helping the Mules pull out the win in their first game decided by fewer than 30 points since early December.

“It takes games like this to make us a better team,” said Clawson. “It shows us that teams are going to be scrappy against us and take chances because they feel they have nothing to lose.

“I think we were a little nervous because we haven’t had close games, but overall I think we handled it well. We just had to stay focused and relaxed.”

Muhlenberg Named a 2015 Best Value College by Kiplingerâs Personal Finance


Praised for Strong Academic Record and Great Economic Value

Muhlenberg College has been named to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance’s list of 100 best values in liberal arts colleges for 2015. The ranking cites four-year schools that combine outstanding academics with affordable cost. Muhlenberg ranked 62nd in liberal arts colleges and 119th among all colleges.
Kiplinger’s assesses quality according to measurable standards, including the admission rate, the percentage of students who return for sophomore year, the student-faculty ratio and the four-year graduation rate. Cost criteria include sticker prices, financial aid and average debt at graduation. Many schools have appeared on the list multiple times (including Muhlenberg), a testament to the consistent value these colleges provide.
“We salute this year’s top schools,” says Janet Bodnar, editor of Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine. “Balancing top-quality education with affordable cost is a challenge for families in today’s economy, which is why Kiplinger’s rankings are such a valuable resource. The schools on the 2015 list offer students the best of both worlds.”
The complete rankings, including the top schools overall as well as the best values in public schools, private universities and private liberal arts colleges, are available online at kiplinger.com/links/college. The rankings will also appear in the February 2015 issue of Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, on newsstands January 6, 2015. Web visitors will find special features, including a tool that lets readers sort by selection criteria; an archive of previous years’ rankings and an FAQ about the ranking methodology.

three field hockey players named all-cc




Three Muhlenberg field hockey players were voted to the All-Centennial Conference team, all for the first time.

Senior back Kristin Garbutt and junior forward Tara Cohn earned second-team honors.

Garbutt (left) started every game at back and led the CC with nine defensive
saves, one short of the school record. She was part of a defense that recorded four shutouts and held four other opponents to one goal.

Cohn (right) had a breakout season as a scorer, tying for ninth in the CC with 12 goals after netting only one goal in her first two years. She recorded a hat 
trick against Moravian and scored the overtime winner in a 1-0 upset of nationally ranked Johns Hopkins.

Senior Michelle Consiglio received honorable mention. She ranked third in the CC in save percentage (.747) and posted a 2.22 goals-against average. 
A two-year starter, Consiglio finished her career eighth on the Mules’ all-time list with 230 career saves.

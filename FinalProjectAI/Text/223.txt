At some point during a studentâs time at Muhlenberg, students may encounter circumstances where it is advisable to temporarily take a step back from their studies in order to attend to family needs, work, travel, or gain a fresh perspective on their intellectual commitments, career plans, or educational priorities. The College encourages students to carefully consider their situations, to clarify their objectives, and to evaluate whether they should temporarily interrupt their studies and take a personal leave of absence.

Students seeking a leave of absence for medical reasons are encouraged to review information on the medical leave of absence process on the Dean of Students website and consult with Michele Paules, Coordinator of Student Support Services.

Cardinal Key Society
Founded in 1942, the Cardinal Key Society is a cohesive program for student involvement in the greater College community, specifically with alumni. In partnership with the Office of Alumni Affairs and the Career Center, Cardinal Key Society members collaborate on events such as Alumni Weekend, Commencement, Honors Convocation, Candlelight Carols and other campus initiatives.
Students are eligible to apply for admission to the society during the fall of their freshman and sophomore years. If selected, students join the following spring and serve through January of their senior year.

softball suffers first two losses




Mens Lacrosse Falls to Ranked Team


The Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team fell behind in the first quarter and could never catch up, falling to 15th-ranked Stevens, 17-10.

The Mules scored the first goal of the game, but the Ducks came back with the next four. Muhlenberg netted two goals in the final four minutes of the first half to go into the break down two, 7-5.

The Mules were shut out in the third quarter, however, as Stevens scored three straight goals to extend its lead top 10-5.

A wild fourth quarter saw 12 goals scored, including four (two by each team) in one 83-second stretch.

Senior Brent Siebold scored three goals for his sixth career hat trick, and junior Alex Ardolino tied his career high with five points.

The threat of darkness, lightning and the first two losses of the season made for a long day for the Muhlenberg softball team.

The Mules lost to Wesleyan, 12-10, and New Jersey, 3-0, on the second-to-last day of their Spring Break trip. Both opponents were in the NCAA Tournament last year.

Muhlenberg, which averaged almost 12 runs in winning its first four games, looked like it would be in

for another big offensive day when it scored 10 runs in the first two innings of the Wesleyan game. The Mules batted around in both innings to take a 10-2 lead.

But that would be the end of the scoring for the day. The Cardinals scored 10 runs in the next three innings to take a 12-10 lead. With daylight fading, Muhlenberg got the tying run to the plate in each of the last three innings but could not score.

Junior Brittany Blohm drove in three runs, and classmate Shelby Smith brought in two.

The Mules moved to a field with lights for their next game, but first Mother Nature showed off her lights, resulting in a lightning delay. The game against New Jersey, scheduled to start at 5:30, did not start until more than two hours later.

Batting against a pitcher who has not given up a run in 21 innings this season, Muhlenberg put runners on second and third with one out in the first on two singles and a stolen base, then did not get another hit the rest of the game.

Senior Ashley Brewer allowed only one hit over the final four innings and finished with a complete-game five-hitter.

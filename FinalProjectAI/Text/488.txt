Niki Kriese attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and during that time participated in residencies at the Montana Artist Refuge, and Ox-Bow School of Art. In 2000 she graduated with a BFA in Painting and Drawing. She remained in Chicago for five years, exhibiting locally and nationally, and receiving Chicago Art Assistance Program grants for three consecutive years. In that time she also founded a critique collective, and ran an occasional apartment gallery. 
 
From 2005-2007 she went to Rhode Island School of Design, earning an MFA in Painting, and received RISDâs Award of Excellence. After graduating, she continued to exhibit, and helped found a cooperative gallery in Long Island City. Since 2014 sheâs run an annual lecture series at Parsons School of Design. She has upcoming solo shows at Adds Donna, in Chicago, Real Art Ways in Hartford CT, and Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA.

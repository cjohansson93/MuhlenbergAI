Chili repeats on first team;McKeon named All-CC for fourth time





McKeon's 2.72 assist-to-turnover ratio would rank fifth in the country, but because of her early season injury she has not played in enough games to qualify for the NCAA statistical rankings.




 
For the second time in as many seasons, Muhlenberg women's basketball junior Alexandra Chili was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team. 

Senior Kelly McKeon and sophomore Alita Zabrecky earned honorable mention after helping lead the Mules to the second seed in the upcoming conference tournament. 

Chili leads the conference, and ranks in the top 25 in the country, in scoring (19.2, 23rd in Division III), free-throw percentage (.856, 20th) and 3-pointers per game (2.75, 16th). The next closest player in the CC scoring race is almost 3.5 points behind Chili.

More than just a scorer, Chili is third on the team, and in the top 15 in the conference, in both assists (56) and steals (40). Her 16 blocks also rank third on the squad.




Chili has made more 3-pointers, 77, than two Centennial Conference teams have made this season.



After needing only 59 games to reach the 1,000-point milestone, Chili ranks fourth on Muhlenberg's all-time scoring list with 1,412 career points. She has also posted the top two single-season point totals in school history, and needs just seven more points this season to own each of the top three totals.

Chili is the Mules' career 3-point leader (239), and is just four away from breaking the all-time CC record.  

McKeon, meanwhile, became only the third player in Muhlenberg history to garner all-conference honors in each of her four years in Allentown. She earned honorable mention as a freshman before being named to back-to-back first teams the past two years.

Last year's conference, and regional, player of the year, McKeon missed the first eight games of this season due to injury. Since returning, she has dished out a team-high 68 assists and averaged a team-best 6.8 rebounds per game.  




Zabrecky's 14 double-figure scoring games rank second on the team.



She currently leads the conference with a 2.72 assist-to-turnover ratio; the second-best ratio is 1.81. McKeon is second among CC players in assists (4.25) and third in steals (2.31). Her total number of assists also ranks sixth in the conference despite playing at least eight games less than the rest of the top six.

Muhlenberg's all-time assists leader, the team captain needs just five more assists to move into sole possession of third place in CC history. McKeon also ranks fifth on the school's all-time scoring list with 1,144 points.

Zabrecky earned the first all-conference honor of her career. She is second on the team, and 18th in the conference, in scoring at 10.7 points per game.

She has been one of Muhlenberg's most active defenders this season and is tied for the team lead, and is seventh in the CC, averaging 2.00 steals per game. 

Zabrecky has used those steals to create fastbreak opportunities, which have allowed her to shoot an efficient 46.2 percent from the field this season, also good for seventh in the conference.

She is one of four Mules with at least 50 assists on the year, and her 0.88 assist-to-turnover ratio ranks 11th in the CC.

This is the seventh season in which Muhlenberg has had at least three players earn all-conference recognition.

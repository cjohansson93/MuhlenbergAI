What is information literacy?
Trexler Library supports the development of information literate students who can discover, organize, analyze, create, and share information in order to achieve their academic goals and to enhance their independent, lifelong learning habits. Information literate students will thereby develop an intellectual framework for critical analysis and reflection of diverse information resources.
Read our entire Statement on Information Literacy here.
How do I incorporate information literacy into my assignments and courses?
Library Instruction
Library instruction sessions take many forms but often are tailored to a specific research project. Librarians can recommend particular resources, demonstrate search techniques, discuss resource evaluation methods, consider how items can properly be incorporated into research, and more, all in our hands-on classroom. Working in partnership with the faculty, librarians help define assignments to enhance your information and literacy course goals. A session can be scheduled for part of a class period, an entire class period, or even span multiple class periods.
Library instruction can be scheduled in a variety of ways:

via the online instruction request form
by contacting the Teaching and Learning Librarian, Rachel Hamelers, at rachelhamelers@muhlenberg.edu / 484-664-3601
by contacting your subject specialist, listed below:

Humanities and Business: Kelly Cannon â kcannon@muhlenberg.edu / 484-664-3602
Sciences: Rachel Hamelers â rhamelers@muhlenberg.edu / 484-664-3601
Social Sciences: Jess Denke â jessicadenke@muhlenberg.edu / 484-664-3552



Note: Please allow at least one week for class preparation.
Student Referrals
Subject librarians are available to work one-on-one with students on a referral or drop-in basis. Contact the subject specialists listed above.
Assignment Ideas
The assignment ideas listed at Alternatives to the Research Paper may help you adapt your existing assignments or develop new assignments.
Contact the Library Instruction Coordinator, Rachel Hamelers (rachelhamelers@muhlenberg.edu / 484-664-3601) or your Subject Specialist Librarian to discuss these and other assignment ideas.
Other Instructional Support
Librarians are available to assist with:

Integrating information literacy components throughout the course and syllabus.
Developing course-specific online research guides.
Teaching students about the proper citation of web and print resources.
Supporting faculty in incorporating instructional media in the library's Information Commons.
Developing informational-related pedagogy for faculty Blackboard/Moodle sites.
Understanding and applying copyright for both classroom work and individual scholarly communication.

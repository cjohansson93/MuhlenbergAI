Student Publications & Presentations The Biology Department at Muhlenberg College recognizes that a research experience is an extremely important aspect of an undergraduate curriculum. We encourage our students to become actively engaged in research. Students may work on projects with faculty sponsors on campus during the academic year or summer, as well as participate in research at an off-campus site or external program during the summer months. The Honors Program provides an opportunity for outstanding senior biology majors to work on a project for an entire year, culminating in a public seminar and written thesis.
In addition, some of these student research experiences result in publication or presentation at a regional or national conference. Recent examples include:

A strong second round lifted the Muhlenberg men’s golf team to a third-place finish at the Mason-Dixon Classic, hosted by McDaniel.

The Mules were in seventh place with a team score of 320 after the first 18 holes but improved their score by
seven strokes on the second day to move up the leaderboard. Among the teams Muhlenberg finished ahead of in the
15-team event were four from the Centennial Conference.

Freshman Evan Overcash (left) came in with an 8-over-par 152 to tie for third place. His
74 in the second round was just one stroke off the day’s best. Overcash was one under par on the back nine both
days and is the third Mule golfer this season to card a 74.

Junior Jonathan Graulich (80-79) and sophomore John Froberg (82-79) also lowered
their scores from the first round to the second. Sophomore David Barkley shot a 161 for the two days.

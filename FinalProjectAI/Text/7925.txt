Men's Soccer Cruises Past Washington

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team capitalized on early chances on its way to a 3-0 victory at Washington. 

“It was great for us to get a couple on the board,” said senior captain  Lance Dotzman. “It was a huge game for us to come out and get our first win on the road.”

Dotzman put the Mules (8-1-2, 3-1-1) ahead 1-0 in the 23rd minute when he buried a pass from senior Travis Wantchekon (right) for his sixth goal of the season. 

Not long after, the Mules would strike again, but this time coming from a different combination. Junior Tommy Hoffmann redirected a Joe Adams throwin into the back of the net to give the Mules a 2-0 advantage in the 30th minute that they would take into halftime. It was Adams’ fifth assist of the season, all coming off of throwins, which moved him into a tie for second among conference leaders.

Sophomore Nick Sarkos added to the lead in the 62nd minute, taking on the Washington defense and unleashing a strike from outside the box that found the back of the net.

Senior goalie Danny Pinto turned away the only two shots on goal that the Muhlenberg defense allowed on the way to his sixth shutout of the season.

“With the end of the season coming up, the guys realize how important each game is moving forward,” said Dotzman.

Kerri Cossean '11

Strategic Planner for Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations
I graduated from Muhlenberg College in 2011 with a double major in History and Russian Studies. I continued my education at Florida International University, where I began my federal career with two internships: first, with the Department of State in Moscow, Russia and second, with the Department of Defense in Doral, Florida. After receiving my Master's Degree in History, I moved to Washington, DC where I have since worked for Department of State, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and currently work as a Strategic Planner for Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations.

Chili Breaks Record in Women’s Basketball Loss


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team shot just 20 percent from the field and fell into third place in the Centennial Conference with a 67-43 loss at Johns Hopkins.

Senior Alexandra Chili scored eight points to run her career total to 1,792 – the most by any Mule basketball player, male or female. Already the top scorer in the history of the women’s program, Chili surpassed the 1,788 points scored by Hall-of-Famer Bob McClure from 1968 to 1971.

Muhlenberg (14-4, 9-4) was outscored 18-7 over a 6:30 period spanning both halves as the first-place Blue Jays (17-2, 12-2) extended their lead from six to 17. The Mules came back from a 17-point second-half deficit at Washington to win their last road game, but this time Hopkins continued to pull away.

The loss snapped a 13-game regular-season road winning streak for Muhlenberg, dating back to last year’s game at Johns Hopkins.

Although they don’t have enough teammates to win dual meets, the seniors on the Muhlenberg wrestling season are doing their best to finish up on a positive note.




Pallotta now has 32 career pins, good for fifth on the Mules' all-time list. His pin in 22 seconds against Merchant Marine was the third-fastest of his career.



The three seniors – Kevin Homan, John Sternlicht and Nick Pallotta – combined to go 7-2 as the Mules opened up their Centennial Conference dual-meet season with a quad at Ursinus.

In contested bouts, Muhlenberg outscored Stevens (12-6) and Merchant Marine (16-3) and tied Ursinus (6-6). Counting the forfeits, the final scores were 42-12 vs. Stevens, 33-16 vs. Merchant Marine and 42-6 vs. Ursinus.

Sternlicht was a perfect 3-0 at 184, pinning his first two opponents before pulling out a 3-2 decision against host Ursinus. Pallotta also pinned his first two foes at heavyweight, needing just 1:47 to do so.

At 149, Homan recorded a major decision against Merchant Marine and scored a takedown in overtime to post a 4-2 win in the Ursinus match. His record for the season is 23-6.

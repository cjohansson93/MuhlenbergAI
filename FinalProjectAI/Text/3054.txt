When it came to academics, the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team was one of the best in Division III in 2009.

The Mules combined for a 3.454 grade point average to rank 25th among the 275 Division III institutions that sponsor women’s track. Muhlenberg was one of 




Like many of her teammates, Lucy Brock cleared many academic hurdles. The graduated senior was one of eight members of the women’s team named to the
Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll.


100 programs honored as an All-Academic Team by the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA). Of the 100 programs, six are from the
Centennial Conference, tying for the most among Division III conferences.

Two members of the team also were honored by the USTFCCCA. Rising seniors Alex Faust and Jennifer Lynch were named to the All-Academic Team for compiling a
cumulative GPA of 3.30 or higher and meeting an NCAA automatic or provisional qualifying standard. Both athletes competed in the NCAA Indoor Championships, Faust in the
pole vault and Lynch in the mile. Faust went on to qualify for the NCAA Outdoor Championships in the pole vault and 400 meters as well, earning All-America honors by 
finishing seventh in the pole vault.

On the men’s side, rising junior Bobby Torphy, a member of the All-America distance medley relay team and a recent Academic All-America honoree, was named
to the All-Academic Team.

The Muhlenberg men’s and women’s teams have been honored for academic excellence by the USTFCCCA nearly 50 times in the last nine years.

The Muhlenberg track and field teams opened their outdoor season a day later than expected at the Lafayette 7-Way Invitational, a meet with five Division I teams and one from Division II. 

Competing for the first time as a team in more than a month, the Mules had some outstanding performances.


Junior Samantha Mayden
finished second in the 800 meters, setting an outdoor personal best of 2:17.33 – the second-best time in Mule history and less than two seconds short of the school record. 

Mayden also ran on the 4x400-meter relay team that finished fourth. Junior Tara Keegan placed fourth in the javelin at 111-1, just six inches short of her personal best.

The highlight on the men’s side was freshman Tyler Bauer finishing fourth in his Muhlenberg debut in the javelin.
His throw of 179-4 ranks fifth on the all-time performance list.

Senior William Lowrey (right) led three Mules who placed in the top eight in the steeplechase, finishing fifth with a time that put him in sixth place on the performance list.

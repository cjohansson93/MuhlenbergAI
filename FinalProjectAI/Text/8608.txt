Mission Statement
In the Department of Media & Communication at Muhlenberg College, students and faculty research, critique, and create media of all formsâvisual, digital, print, oral and hybrid formsâand investigate the social, political, economic, and cultural contexts that both shape and are shaped by these converging media.  Here, critical thinking meets hands-on experience, through engaging coursework, internships in professional environments, experiential and service-learning in local communities and global contexts.  Our aim is to foster graduates who are not only information literate, but who become information leaders in helping to realize the democratizing potential of media.  The department is dedicated to the integration of media analysis and media production for social justice in a liberal arts setting.

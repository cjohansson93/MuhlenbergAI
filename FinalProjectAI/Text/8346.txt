Why Study Film at Muhlenberg?

Weâre a leader. The overlapping Film Studies, Media & Communication, and Documentary Storymaking programs at Muhlenberg have 16 full-time faculty, making us the largest liberal arts film and media programs in the United States â with more extensive offerings than many large universities.
Our students have access to an unparalleled range of film and media expertise, in courses taught by accomplished teachers.
Weâre one of a select few liberal arts colleges with a production program. The theory and practice of cinema are seamlessly integrated.
Youâll get access to equipment and filmmaking, with the small classes and personalized attention of a liberal arts college.
Muhlenbergâs top-ranked theatre program means you can work with some of Americaâs best student actors.
We have specialized courses in every facet of the filmmaking process, from pre-production and screenwriting to editing. The most recent addition, Directing and Performance for Film.
A liberal arts college is the best place to develop yourself and your creative potential. Running a camera isnât the hard part â ideas are the hard part, and your ideas are going to come from being a smart person who knows something about the world.
No matter what kind of film youâre interested in making or studying, you can learn about it here. Our courses cover everything from silent cinema to the latest festival hits from around the world, from Hollywood to Bollywood, and from documentary to the avant-garde.












          Q.	How many of your students get jobs? Where?
  








 

Generally all of our students who want a production or industry job and are willing to move for it get one. They work in all aspects of film and media production, from development to editing. Some decide to take their skills and move into online work, advertising, and other related fields. Many also work for festivals and in education.

 






          Q. Can I double major?
  








A. Yes. You can double major with film and ANYTHING else. We have film and neuroscience majors, film and business, film and religion, and everything in between.






          Q. Are some double majors more popular than others?
  








A. The most common are Media & Communication, English, and Theatre. Each of these overlap with Film, so you can double-count up to 4 courses, and this makes them easier to complete. But you can double major in anything. Muhlenbergâs minor in Creative Writing is also a popular overlap â screenwriting courses count in both programs.






          Q. Do you have study abroad?
  








A. You can go almost anywhere in the world. Our key program is in Dublin, where you go with a faculty member and get an internship in Dublin, (which looks great on a resumÃ©). A lot of our students study at FAMU in Prague, which is one of the best film schools in the world. There are programs in screenwriting or production and you need to submit work to get in. Our acceptance rate is very close to 100% and we have heard from the schoolâs director that our students always compare favorably against students who come from NYU and other larger schools.






          Q. What about internships?
  








A. Our students intern at companies large and small, often in NYC in the summer or in other major cities. Our students work at major studios and national TV and media (Paramount, MTV, etc.). During the year, there are hands-on internships in the Allentown area.
 






          Q. Whatâs your alumni network like?
  








A. Extensive. We bring alums to campus every year in the spring to network with students and keep them up to date on the latest developments in their fields during Alumni Week. A lot of those visits lead directly to jobs for students.






          Q. Tell me about your equipment.
  








A. We keep it up to date every year. We've been working in HD for years, and are moving into 4K. We edit using Adobe Premiere on new Macs. Unlike some schools, you can use our equipment in your first semester, and donât have to be enrolled in a class. We have a lot of gear and we like to see it being used. We have a full-function TV studio that students use to program an on-campus station. Check out our equipment & facilties here.






          Q. How can I learn more?
  








A. If you'd like to come for a tour or to sit in a class, youâd be most welcome. Contact the program director, Amy Corbin, here. We can arrange a visit or answer any questions not answered here.

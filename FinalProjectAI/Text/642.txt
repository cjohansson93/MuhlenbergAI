Physics Minor Requirements
The department offers a minor in physics, requiring a minimum of six course units, including: PHY 121 General Physics I , PHY 122 General Physics II
A student interested in the minor in physics should consult with the faculty advisor to develop a program suited to the individualâs vocational and/or personal objectives. A student may be advised to enroll mathematics courses beyond MTH 121 Calculus I in order to complete a specific minor program successfully.
The College offers an interdisciplinary physical science major. The physical science major is specifically designed to meet the core courses required for students interested in pursuing the Pre-Engineering Combined Plan program with Columbia University. See Interdisciplinary Science and/or Academic Partnerships for more details.

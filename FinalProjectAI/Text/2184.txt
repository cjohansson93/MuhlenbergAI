First Meeting: May 3, 2022 â 7 to 10 pmWe are hoping to begin rehearsals as early as Aug. 20, 2022 (prior to the start of the Fall semester) but this will be completely dependent on the schedules/availability of the performers.Performances: Sept. 30 â Oct. 2, 2022PRODUCTION INFORMATION:Project DescriptionIn Jackie Sibblies Druryâs We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German SÃ¼dwestafrika, Between the Years 1884â1915,  six actors gather to tackle the challenge of theatrically presenting the little-known story of the first genocide of the 20th century.Armed only with boxes of letters from German soldiers they sent home to their wives and families, our characters are maneuver how to tell the history of this Genocide when the only record remains is of the perpetratorsâ story. If that was not enough of a challenge, they must also maneuver how to talk to each other about racism, genocide, and systemic oppression.Along the way, they test the limits of empathy as their own stories, subjectivities, assumptions, and prejudices catalyze their theatrical process. Ultimately the play takes a dark turn as the American wounds and the historical tragedy overlap within this ensembleâs process.Character Breakdown/DescriptionsWe Are Proud to Present requires six actors: two white men, one white woman, two Black men, and one Black woman. It is an energetic ensemble piece in which all the roles are of equal size and importance. Performers are on stage for the entirety of the play.All characters are young, fiercely energetic, skillful, playful, and a bit naÃ¯ve. They are still learning and discerning who they are in this world and are reckoning with history from their backgrounds.A sense of musicality and the ability to improv are necessary for all roles.Actors will work with the following accents/dialects: German, African and Southern.

A Note on Gender/Pronouns from the Director   The following pronouns belong to the characters as written in the play. However, actors from all gender identities are welcome and highly encouraged to audition. Please do not worry if you think your personal pronouns do not align with those of the characters; I can and will engage in conversation to ensure equitable practices are engaged in casting.Actor 1 / White Man: (He/Him)âAll American,â charming, well educated, and well-meaning. âWokeâ but casually inflicts microaggressions. Bad at acting and improv, and this makes him incredibly self-conscious.Actor 2 / Black Man: (He/Him)He is proud of his roots and his Blackness. Widely observant and intelligent but also incredibly underestimated. Masculine, powerful, and confident. He would be a great leader if it werenât for his stubbornness and poor teamwork skills.Actor 3 / Another White Man: (He/Him)Goofy, confident, and a bit self-possessed. He can be a bit of a class clown and often puts his foot in his mouth.Actor 4 / Another Black Man: (He/Him)Soft, sweet, thoughtful, gentle, and willing. Can be the groupâs black sheep, often not fitting in with anyone.Actor 5 / Sarah: (She/Her)She is incredibly bubbly, eager, and a bit of an overachiever. She is a performer at heart and often sacrifices the truth for the sake of performance.Actor 6 / Black Woman: (She/Her)The leader and organizer of the group. She is idealistic, generous, and kind but still authoritative, sharp, and quick-witted.CONTENT NOTICE:This play contains violent language, themes of prejudice, genocide, erasure, stark imagery, and racial epithets.Additionally, there are moments of racially charged physical violence, including the presence and use of a noose.A LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR ON THE CONTENT:This play will ask its performers to engage in complex material around race, genocide, and historical/systemic oppression. Not only that, but I will be asking you to engage in this material with your peers and me during the rehearsal process. This play, at its core, is about how do we have difficult conversations around race, genocide, and its gruesome history. The characters are floundering as they seek the truth and ultimately lash out at one another.For Black performers, this play will ask a lot of you mentally and emotionally. This play and I will ask you to engage with material that can be potentially triggering for Black bodies. For white performers, this play and I will ask you to perform components of whiteness and white violence against Black bodies that you may not personally identify with but is crucial to the story. While this play may ask a lot of you, it also gives a lot. It provides an opportunity for feeling, and space for conversations to arise and may help make change a reality.This rehearsal process and production will be steeped in Restorative Practices to allow for open community dialogue between all those involved. Restorative Practices explore how to strengthen relationships between individuals and communities. To get to the root of this play, we will engage in open community learning dialogues within the production community to heal and build healthy rehearsal/performance practices.

          Prop & Costume Requests
  








 
Dance Costume Loan Requests
The Theatre & Dance Department maintains a stock of props and costumes from past productions that students can borrow for their work in scenes and class projects. Please note, not all items are available for loan.

It's important that you plan ahead to ensure that you have the items you need in time for your project.

Here's how it worksâ¦

1. Choose your items

Contact Katrina in Props or Lex in the Costume Shop to see what they have that will fill your needs. See below for details. They might just be able to leave your items at the Box Office, or you might need to come in and take a look.
 

2. Pay your deposit
Once you've determined that there are items that meet your needs, come to the Box Office to pay your $20 refundable deposit. You can do this when you pick up items left for you. Box Office hours are Monday through Friday, noon â 6 pm.


3. Get your stuff
If items are left for you, just pick them up at the box office. If you need to take a look at stock, you can take your items with you when you find them (after you've paid your deposit, of course).


4. Use the stuff
Break a leg â but not your props and costumes! Take care of 'em! You're responsible for their safe, intact return.

5. Bring it back

You can return your items to the Box Office, again Monday through Friday, noon to 6 pm. You'll get your deposit back when the stuff comes back on time and in good condition.






Deposits
You can pay the $20 refundable deposit at the Box Office, via cash, check, or credit card. Each deposit covers up to five items. If you need both costumes and props, you'll need to pay two separate $20 deposits. Be sure hang onto the receipt for your deposit.

Prop Loans
To borrow props, email Katrina at props@muhlenberg.edu, to see if we have what you're looking for. Katrina can let you know what's available, or make an appointment for you to come take a look. If she has what you're looking for, you can arrange to have her leave it at the box office for pickup.
You may also come visit Prop Storage, in the Empie stage-right wing, during the posted hours of Friday noon to 2 pm to look through the stock of props. You must pay your $20 deposit before you take your items.
   Studio Productions may reserve furniture and leave it in prop storage until tech rehearsals. All other props should be taken with you at the time you select them.


Costume Loans
To borrow costumes from theatre costume stock or dance stock, fill out one of these forms:


Theatrical Costume Stock Request
Dance Costume Stock Request


Upon receipt of the form, Lex will determine whether Costume Stock includes any items that will suit your needs, and/or contact you to make an appointment to look through stock. There's no guarantee that requests can be fulfilled.
   You can view available dance stock using the online Dance Stock Catalogue. Multiple options should be provided, in case the costume(s) being requested are unavailable. Feel free to include photos and/or links in the form. If we have what you need, Lex will leave it for pickup at the box office.
   For Studio Productions, a z-rack can be made available for costumes to be held. All other costumes need to be taken at the time of rental.
   Costumes must be returned no later than the end of the semester they were borrowed â by Friday of Finals Week.

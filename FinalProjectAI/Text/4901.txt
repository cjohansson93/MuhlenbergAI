men’s lax loses heartbreaker in opener


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team wants to 86 that 8-7.

Stevens scored three quick goals early in the fourth quarter and held on to beat the Mules, 8-7, in a thrilling 




Watkins added an assist to his two goals, finishing with a career-high three points.



opening game of the 2010 season. Last year, Muhlenberg
lost three games by that score, all to teams that went on to earn berths to the NCAA Tournament.

Stevens wasn’t one of the teams that the Mules 


lost to by a single goal last year. The Ducks handed Muhlenberg a decisive 16-4 defeat en route to a 12-6 season,
which included the ECAC Metro/South championship, and received votes in the 2010 preseason Division III poll. So in that respect, there was plenty positive for Muhlenberg to
take away from this game.

In fact, the Mules dominated the game in every area but the scoreboard. They had a 50-30 advantage in shots and won 13 of 18 faceoffs. But, as most teams do, they had
trouble solving Stevens All-America goalie Dave Decker, who made 25 saves.

Sophomore Alex Ardolino assisted junior Brent Siebold on a man-up goal 

midway through the first quarter, then scored with 5:23 left in the period to put
Muhlenberg up 3-2. The Ducks controlled the second period, however, netting three goals, one with just a second left on the clock to take a 5-3 lead into the locker room.

The Mules came back strong in the third quarter, scoring three goals of their own to seize 




Carpetto more than doubled his career total of two goals coming into the game.



the lead back at 6-5. Senior Al Carpetto scored two of the goals, completing
his first career hat trick.

Stevens continued the seesaw in the fourth quarter, putting three shots in the cage in a span of 1:51 to go back ahead, 8-6. Muhlenberg cut the margin in half when
sophomore Clint Watkins netted his second goal with 8:44 left.

The Mules appeared to have tied the score with 3:16 left when Ardolino’s shot trickled past Decker, but it landed in the side of the net, not the back. Muhlenberg
turned the ball over with just over a minute remaining, but junior Tom Brant picked up an errant Stevens clearing pass to give the Mules one final possession.

With 25 seconds left, Stevens was called for an offisde penalty, giving Muhlenberg an extra-man opportunity, but Decker saved a potential game-tying shot.

Sophomore Nick Rispoli had an excellent day in the X, winning eight of nine faceoffs.

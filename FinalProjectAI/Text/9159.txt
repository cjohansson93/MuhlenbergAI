Associate Professor - Business Coordinator - Business Program B.S., Pennsylvania State University M.B.A., Ph.D., Lehigh University





Donna J. Bergenstock joined Muhlenbergâs Department of Accounting, Business, Economics & Finance in 2000. She holds a B.S. degree in Marketing from The Pennsylvania State University, an M.B.A. from Lehigh University and a Ph.D. in Business and Economics also from Lehigh University. While completing her Ph.D. and prior to joining Muhlenbergâs faculty, Dr. Bergenstock taught at other universities and colleges in the Lehigh Valley and worked in advertising and for a not-for-profit organization.
Currently, Dr. Bergenstock teaches the introductory Marketing course, Globalization & Marketing, Business & Society and a CUE (culminating undergraduate experience) course in Marketing Management.  She has also offered a First-Year Seminar titled âDeBeers:  Are Diamonds Really Forever?â and taught classes addressing International Business. Her courses are known for semester-long projects requiring group-work, rigorous academic research and critical analysis.    As an academic researcher of the international diamond industry, Dr. Bergenstock has enjoyed international recognition. Her Ph.D. dissertation analyzed the impact of Russian diamond sales on the De Beers organization. Her first book, An Analysis of the International Diamond Market, also addressed the managerial strategies and marketing challenges facing De Beers in the new millennium. She has attended diamond industry conferences in Antwerp and appeared on ABC News 20/20 with John Stossel.  She has presented papers and had published proceedings papers at national conferences in the areas of marketing pedagogy, marketing management, and competitiveness. Her publications on the diamond industry appear in scholarly journals such as The Southern Economic Journal and Business Horizons.
Today, Dr. Bergenstockâs areas of research and inquiry address pedagogical advancements within the marketing discipline, the Kimberley Process of diamond certification, issues concerning globalization, and the economics and marketing of international adoption. She continues to mentor studentsâ honorâs theses and collaborates with students on a variety of research projects.

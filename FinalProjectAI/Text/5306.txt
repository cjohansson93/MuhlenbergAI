With the win, Muhlenberg (18-3, 14-0) clinched the Centennial Conference regular-season title and hosting rights for the league semifinals and final the weekend of February 28 and March 1. With four games to play, the Mules have a five-game lead over five teams that are all tied at 8-5.

Muhlenberg, ranked 20th in the WBCA Division III poll, also tied the record for best CC start ever. Johns Hopkins started and finished 14-0 in 1997, and McDaniel won its first 14 en route to a 17-1 CC record in 2004.

Muhlenberg led 39-12 at the half, with freshman Alexandra Chili scoring more points than the entire Bryn Mawr team. She finished the game with 15 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists.

Senior Lauren Boyle led the Mules, who shot almost 50 percent, with 18 points on 9-of-12 shooting in only 20 minutes.

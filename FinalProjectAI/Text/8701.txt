Merit Scholarships

All transfers are considered for Merit Scholarships.
We review the studentâs high school transcript, SAT/ACT scores, as well as any classes completed at another institution.
If you receive a merit award, you will be notified within two weeks of acceptance.
Merit Scholarships range between $1,000-$20,000.

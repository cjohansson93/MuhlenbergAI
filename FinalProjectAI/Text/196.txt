About the Internship Program
The Accounting, Business, Economics, and Finance program at Muhlenberg has a flourishing internship program. Students may select an internship through our internship database or they can develop an internship through their own contacts. Our internship coordinator, Michael London, helps students find, design, and get placed in an internship. Internships may count for course credit but they do not have to, and many students take on internships that do not count for college credit but give them needed experience. For more information please visit our Internship Website. In any given academic year 50 or more students are typically working in internships in which they are also earning college credit toward graduation. In addition, close to 50 students participate in internships each year that are not for academic credit. Nearly 80% of ABEF students participate in an internship during the pursuit of their major, and over 60% of those have more than one internship while at Muhlenberg.
Internships for creditStudents can elect to receive course credit for an internship.  This option allows you the time to focus on your internship and to be part of a cohort, learning from peers having similar experiences.  It is also important that you bring together theory and practice to deepen your learning.  Employers will hope to hear you speak about your internship with both scholarship and real world experience.  Interactions with faculty and peers bring together knowledge gained through past and present course work, applying it in real time to deal with real work issues.Students have internships at a variety of organizations including:

Air Products and Chemicals
PP&L Corporation
BlackRock
Deloitte & Touche
Pricewaterhouse Coopers
Athletes' Performance
Monumental Sports & Entertainment
Reebok International
And many others

 Students that want to learn more about internship opportunities or about the internship program in the ABEF Department should contact Michael London (ABEF Internship Director).

Read about their internship experiences:
Robert Borkow
Majors: Business AdministrationClass of 2018
Northwestern Mutual â New York City, NY
I worked as a financial representative intern where I was tasked with client acquisition and some servicing of current clients. Through the experience, I discovered how much I enjoyed working with clients and I found a true passion for wealth management. I also found financial planning very interesting; it was like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. I was the number one intern in the division based on points (policies sold and corresponding premium commission) out of 22. I received a job offer for when I graduate. Grateful to have found this opportunity through the Career Center!

Elizabeth Clark
Majors: Finance & AccountingDeloitte â  Parsippany, NJ
I worked with the Deloitte Audit Innovation team and on Honeywell as a client. Most of my time was spent working on projects that were related to Honeywell's quarter two statements. These included controls testing, roll forwards, leadsheets, and ROMMS. My team was very helpful and supportive, which made the internship so rewarding. I was happy that so many of the finance courses use Excel because a lot of my time was spent working in Excel. I felt well prepared.

Chelsea Gary
Majors: Finance & Business AdministrationClass of 2018J.P. Morgan Chase â Wilmington, DE
I was tasked with ensuring the integrity of the company's general ledger, which houses all of their financial statements. I've learned so much in terms of technical skills with Excel and working in the financial services industry. I personally send out the team's consolidated metrics each day, which reports on breaks (errors) that have taken place within different product systems and measures the monetary impact.

James Tully
Major: EconomicsClass of 2018Tradeweb â New York City, NY
I directly assisted the Sales team members by creating custom call sheets to quicken calling procedure, and I helped with enablement of client features on Tradeweb software. I also had the opportunity to sit in on company strategy meetings led by the Head of sales and on meetings where sales team members assisted clients from various banks and hedge funds. The information and insight I gained from observing those meetings was invaluable. I also participated in Wall Street Financial Educational Sessions that were led by different company employees. I know I can bring the knowledge I gained from this experience back into my Economics and Finance courses.

Charles Young
Majors: Finance & Business AdministrationClass of 2018Greenberg & Rapp â East Hanover, NJ
I was responsible for updating the companyâs Redtail CRM â this system manages client records.  I tracked, organized, and updated client portfolios. I also had the opportunity to run simulations on various investments to find the highest returns, which I really enjoyed. I was also able to sit in on client meetings and learn how to effectively present financial data and propose new investment opportunities to clients. 

John Colt
Majors: Economics & FinanceClass of 2020Hunter Roberts Construction Group â Villanova, PA
I worked with the companyâs project management team that was overseeing the renovation of the Villanova Pavilion (men's basketball stadium). I was responsible for managing the drawings and blueprints for the demolition and renovation as they came in. I also assisted in preparing and facilitating the transfer of budget reports and change orders for the executives. I enjoyed being part of the process and seeing the overlap between athletics and finance.

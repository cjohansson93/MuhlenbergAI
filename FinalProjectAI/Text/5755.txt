five named to district academic squads


Five Muhlenberg athletes – four in football and one in volleyball – were selected to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division teams. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.2 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team.



Two football players, junior John DeLuca and senior Jordon Grube, were named to the first team and will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America honors.

DeLuca (left), an accounting major, is the 16th-leading rusher in Division III, averaging 126.0 yards per game. A two-time Centennial Conference player of the week, he leads the
undefeated Mules with 12 touchdowns and is fourth in team history with 2,008 career yards.

Grube (right), a biology major and economics minor, was selected to the Academic All-District squad for the second time; he was a second-team selection in 2005. The
reigning CC special teams player of the week, Grube is tied for second on the Mules in scoring with 38 points and has 23 career field goals, four short of the school record.

Senior offensive guard Patrick Calves and senior linebacker Dustin Good were voted to the second team. Calves, a double major in economics and Spanish, has
started four games this season, during which Muhlenberg averaged 36.8 points per game, and Good leads the stingy Mule defense with 12 tackles for loss.


Senior Jess Anselmi earned third-team honors for volleyball. A business administration major and double minor in Spanish and political science, Anselmi was the Mules’
leading hitter in 2007, averaging 2.90 kills per game. She finished her career eighth on Muhlenberg’s all-time list with 747 career kills.

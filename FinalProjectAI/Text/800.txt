Adapting Snow White Today: Narrative and Gender Analysis in the Television Show Once Upon a Time
 
This paper examines the narrative in the first season of the ABC television show Once Upon a Time (2011-Present) and the fairytale Snow White (1857) with a particular focus on female gender representation. The reappearance of fairytales in popular media provides a unique opportunity to examine how values between two very different time periods have changed. Utilizing a narrative approach allows the research to show the merits and limitations across adapting from an old text to a television serial. Once Upon a Time offers a progressive rendition of the character Snow White by challenging both the traditional narrative and the television serial narrative. Snow Whiteâs relationships with other characters are also expanded upon in the televised tale and surround her heroic acts, rather than her beauty, which changes the values presented in the television series.

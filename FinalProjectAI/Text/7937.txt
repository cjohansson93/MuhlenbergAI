Men's Soccer Downs Ducks, Volleyball Hangs Ten

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s 1-0 victory over Stevens was hardly the coast-to-coast win it had last time out, when it scored in the fourth minute en route to a 3-0 shutout of Moravian. 

The Mules went back and forth with the Ducks until senior Joey Roberts (left), freshly reentered into the game, took a perfect rolling cross from classmate Travis Wantchekon and slammed it into the back of the net in the 66th minute. The goal was Roberts’ first of the year.

Muhlenberg had the better share of chances in the first half, but the second frame saw a more even attack on both sides. Senior Danny Pinto recorded his third straight shutout, making two saves and keeping possession on the Mules’ attacking half with his long kicks from the box when the pressure built in the final period.

Pinto’s experienced backs made several key plays in the waning moments to keep the home team ahead. Seniors Joe Adams, Oliver Katz and Bryan Attanasio played a physical brand of soccer that made the attacking area of the Ducks a hard place to penetrate. 


The win puts the Mules at 4-0 on the season, their best start since 2011.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team won three of four matches at the Knights Invitational in its third tournament in as many weekends.

The Mules went 3-1 at two of the tourneys and 4-0 at their own Buttermaker for a record of 10-2 heading into Wednesday’s Centennial Conference opener at defending regular-season champion Franklin & Marshall. It’s the fastest the Mules have reached double digits in wins since 1994, when they started 10-1.

Muhlenberg began the tournament with a three-set loss to Eastern, which has reached the NCAA quarterfinals in two of the last three years and is currently ranked 12th in Division III, before rebounding to defeat host Neumann, Moravian and Widener.

Junior Katherine Boll led the Mules with 36 kills and hit .347 in the four matches. Sophomore Allison Glass totaled 32 kills, with a high of 12 vs. Neumann.

Junior Sarah Weyhumuller recorded nine kills in only 13 attempts vs. Moravian. Senior Nikki Dickson (right) served up 15 aces over the weekend, doubling her season total coming in.

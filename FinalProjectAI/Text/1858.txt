Advising Students with Disabilities

Academic advising plays a key role in the success of students with disabilities as they make the transition to post secondary institutions. During the academic advising process, students may identify themselves as having a disability.
Students with documented disorders that may rise to the level of a disability may receive a pre-advising appointment during the June Advising Event. To make this session valuable, it is important for students with diagnosed conditions to have their documentation submitted to the Office of Disability Services in advance of the June Advising Event. Submitting the documentation in advance allows the Office of Disability Services to review the studentsâ history and to review previously provided accommodations and services as they relate to the diagnosed condition.
The pre-advising opportunity is available each semester after the disability determination process has been completed. In order to maximize the benefit of the pre-advising opportunity, it is best that these discussions take place prior to each semesterâs registration period.

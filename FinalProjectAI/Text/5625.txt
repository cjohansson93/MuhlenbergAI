20 for women’s lax; 100 for armstrong


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team’s 20-5 victory over Moravian was a memorable match for senior Taylor Armstrong, who joined the Mule 100-point club. Entering the encounter with 99 career points, Armstrong needed only one more to surpass the century mark.

Twenty-two minutes 



Junior Kate Noone contributed to the win with one goal and one assist.



into the game, she connected with junior Ruth Morrongiello, who scored to make the result 11-1 in favor of the Mules. However, Armstrong wasn’t aware of her personal milestone.

 “I had no idea I reached 100 points,” said Armstrong, who finished the game with one goal and four assists. “It was definitely a goal of mine. I remember that during my sophomore year one of my friends as a senior hit her 100th point, too.”

The Mountain Lakes, N.J., native has ambitions to enter her name in more statistical categories in the record book before the end of her collegiate career.

 “I want to end my career with a high number of assists,” Armstrong said. “I really hope to make a mark in assists.”

Following the match against Moravian, Armstrong has accumulated 46 assists and lies in fourth place for career helpers in Muhlenberg’s record book. She leads the squad in points with 18 points in four games (10 goals and eight assists).

Morrongiello tallied seven points in the commanding win, finishing with four goals and three assists. Sophomore Alyssa Bascelli added a hat trick, while freshman Rachael Goldstein, sophomore Amanda McGovern and freshman Brianna Manko each contributed two goals. 

The Mules (3-1) registered their 19th successive victory against non-conference opposition and remained undefeated in matches against their Lehigh Valley rival. They also maintained the tradition to score at least 16 goals against the Greyhounds, improving to 6-0 in the all-times series. 

The prolific Muhlenberg offense generated 20 goals for second time this season after the 20-10 win against King’s in the opening game of the season. The last time the Mules scored at least 20 goals more than once in one season was during the 2003 campaign.

The defensive unit demonstrated improvement as the Mules limited the opposition’s attack to single-digit goals for the second straight match.

 “We tried a new defense today and I think it worked really well,” Armstrong said.

The Mules and the Greyhounds continue their quest for the 2007-08 Matte Award. With the success the Muhlenberg cut the deficit to 5-4.

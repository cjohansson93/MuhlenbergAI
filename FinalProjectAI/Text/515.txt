Welcome to Muhlenbergâs Martin Art Gallery
We engage in Muhlenbergâs vibrant cultural dialogue by bringing exhibits of all genres and media to the heart of our campus community. Our goal is to expose students, faculty, staff and the visiting public to diverse, high-quality national and international artists in several exhibition spaces located in our Philip Johnson designed Baker Center for the Arts. Martin Art Gallery is a non-commercial space for creative research, which hosts roughly a dozen exhibitions each year.  We employ two primary exhibition spaces:  The Martin Art Gallery, a 1600 sf dedicated space, and our Galleria area, which holds multiple exhibitions and permanent collection works simultaneously.  Exhibition spaces are accessible via the atrium of the Baker Center for the Arts.The Gallery supplements its year-round exhibition schedule with gallery talks, artist receptions and interdisciplinary programs. All exhibits and events are free and open to the public.The Martin Art Gallery is home to an extensive permanent collection more than 3,000 items, many of which rotate through public display in various buildings and offices throughout campus. Each spring, we proudly host the Senior Thesis Exhibition in the main Gallery space.
Hours, Location, Parking

Muhlenberg College and Martin Art Gallery sit on the original homelands of the Leni Lenape peoples. Martin Art Gallery is located in the Baker Center for the Arts building, located on the campus of Muhlenberg College 2400 Chew Street, Allentown PA 18104. The Gallery is open Tuesday-Saturday from 12:00 p.m. â 8:00 p.m. While the Galleria Lobby and adjacent exhibition spaces are accessible daily from 9:00 a.m. â 9:00 p.m. Public on-street parking is typically available, though municipal parking regulations apply to all visitors.
For Artists and CuratorsMartin Art Gallery will accept and review proposals from independent curators and artists on a rolling basis, with the preferred format for submissions being a PDF proposal sent by email to the MAG Director, with links to supplemental web portfolios.  We do not typically accept traveling/packaged exhibitions or reiterations of previous shows. The process is very competitive and we prioritize submissions with all or majority new/first run work, or works that have not been shown together, as is the case with unique curatorial projects.  In cases where we see the potential to partner with an artist or curator to implement a specific project, we will proactively reach out to schedule a follow up conversation.

Men's Soccer Remains Undefeated, Sets Up Showdown
 Tuesday, September 30, 2014







					 



The defense of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team drew attention earlier this season after recording five straight shutouts
and going more than 530 minutes without allowing a goal.

Now, the defense is taking over the offense too.

Starting center backs Tommy Hoffmann and Joe Adams teamed up for both goals as the Mules
extended their season-opening unbeaten streak to nine with a 2-1 home win against Swarthmore.



Muhlenberg, ranked 21st in both Division III polls, lost twice to the Garnet last year, including a season-ending setback in
the ECAC Tournament. The win was the first for the Mules (7-0-2, 2-0-1) against Swarthmore (6-3-1, 0-3) since 2007.

“We knew we hadn’t beaten them in a while, but we tried to treat it like a normal game,” said Hoffmann.
“We don’t like to drop points at home. We wanted to get three points and keep climbing the conference ladder. This
was a stepping stone.”

Both Muhlenberg goals came off set pieces in the second half. 

Nine minutes after the intermission, Adams uncorked a long throw from near the corner that made its way to the far post,
where Hoffmann was waiting to head it in. It was the first career goal for the junior.

The Mules have scored four goals in the last four games directly off long throws from Adams (left).
 
“Joe has a cannon,” said Hoffmann. “I go up for those [long throws] and try to get my head on them. 
Oftentimes it’s not the first ball, but that’s just the way it worked out tonight.”

The second goal came 12 minutes later off a corner kick. The initial kick was cleared back out to the top of the box. 
Hoffmann tapped the ball back to Adams, who blasted it in for his second career goal.

The game seemed well in hand until Muhlenberg had a player sent off with just under 15 minutes to go. Swarthmore took
advantage of playing a man up and cut the deficit in half by scoring off a corner kick with 9:55 left. 

But the Mules held on and will head into Friday’s showdown at Franklin & Marshall – ranked third in one poll and
eighth in the other – still with a zero in their loss column.

“It’s not something I would have expected,” said Hoffmann of the undefeated start. “I knew we were capable,
but being capable is different from executing. We’ve done a really good job executing, and we’re definitely
confident heading into the F&M game.”

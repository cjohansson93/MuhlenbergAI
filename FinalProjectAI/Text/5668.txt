Men’s Basketball

A decisive 18-4 run in the second half sent the Gettysburg men’s basketball team to a 66-62 win against Muhlenberg, snapping the Mules’ nine-game
home Centennial Conference winning streak.

The Bullets (17-3, 12-2), whose only two CC losses are to nationally ranked Ursinus, used the big run to open up the only double-digit lead of the game, 
59-49 with 4:42 remaining. Muhlenberg (10-11, 8-6) came back to score the next seven points and had two possessions in the last 2:30 with a chance to tie, but could not hit a three,
and Gettysburg went 7-for-7 from the line the rest of the way to seal the win.

Sophomore Peter Barnes scored a career-high 17 points on 8-of-12 shooting and blocked three shots; it was the fifth straight game he set or matched his career best
in points. 

The Mules held the Bullets, who had shot 50 percent or better in three of their last four games, to 35.8-percent shooting.

Muhlenberg slipped into a tie for fourth place in the CC with McDaniel, a game behind Johns Hopkins and a game ahead of both Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall.

Junior Billy Hall registered a pair of pins as the Muhlenberg wrestling team split its last two regular-season Centennial Conference matches, defeating 
Washington and Lee, 25-15, and falling to McDaniel, 25-18. 

Hall needed less than two minutes to pin down both his opponents, winning in 53 seconds against Sammy Brusca from Washington and Lee and 1:03 against McDaniel’s Tom Boehm. 
The Chester, N.J., native improved to 24-4 overall and 7-1 in dual meets during the 2007-08 campaign.

Junior Justin Fitch also notched two victories for Muhlenberg in the 174-pound weight class, earning an 8-4 decision against Robert Terrin (W&L) and a 
4-1 decision against Courtney Nightengale (McDaniel). 

In the most pulsating bout on the day, junior Matt Friedman (above) defeated Tim Manson (W&L), 5-4 in the 157-pound division. 
Trailing 4-0 at the beginning of the third period, Friedman scored a takedown and a three-point near-fall. He also eliminated Manson’s riding time to record his 
first season win.

Seniors Chris Swensen (197) and Joe Tartar (HWT) extended an 18-15 lead by winning the final two bouts for the Mules in their success against Washington and Lee. 

Muhlenberg was leading 15-6 against McDaniel after the first four bouts ended, but the Green Terror won five of the next six contests to steal the victory.

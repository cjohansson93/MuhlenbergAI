Flank Wins Three Bouts at "Rose Bowl of Wrestling"
 Saturday, December 28, 2013







					 




Freshman Jaryd Flank is off to an out-standing start with the Muhlenberg wrestling team. And he had an out-standing start at the Wilkes Open, pinning his first opponent while standing.

Flank’s highly unusual pin was the highlight of a strong showing by the Mules at the 81st edition of a prestigious tournament dubbed “The Rose Bowl of Wrestling.”

Three Muhlenberg wrestlers combined to go 5-6 at the Wilkes Open, which featured 11 Division I schools and a host team ranked fifth in Division III.

Flank’s first bout at 125 was against Wilkes wrestler Guesseppe Rea, who finished fourth in the tournament last year. Trailing 6-2 early in the second period, Flank put Rea on his back but could not lay flat on top of him because Rea was holding him up by his right ankle. Despite being in an odd position (left), Flank had control of both of Rea’s legs, and before signaling a takedown the referee slapped the mat for the pin.  




Flank went on to go 3-2 for the second straight tournament. He lost his next bout, 15-14 on riding time, to a Brown opponent who would go on to advance to the final. Flank defeated opponents from Binghamton and Slippery Rock before falling to a Rutgers wrestler in the consolation semifinals. Rea ended up finishing fourth for the second straight year.

Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit (right) split four bouts at 149, with his losses coming to the class runner-up from Rutgers and an opponent from Slippery Rock. Chengsupanimit defeated two Wilkes opponents, the first one a come-from-behind 6-3 decision after he conceded an early takedown and the second with his first pin of the season.

Lora Taub 
Professor, Media & CommunicationDean for Digital Learning Program Director, LVAIC Documentary Storymaking Minor lorataub@muhlenberg.edu www.lorataub.comTrexler B
Background
B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Communications, University of California, San Diego
Lora Taub-Pervizpour's work explores the affordances of new digital media as resources for critical participation in democratic society, with a particular interest in new digital technologies and youth agency and voice. Much of her thinking on these issues emerges from her long-term ethnographic research on the socio-cultural impacts of digital media in the lives of children.  Locally, she explores these relationships in the context of HYPE, a youth media program for Allentown teens that uses digital media and documentary production as tools for amplifying young peopleâs presence and participation in community life.  This collaboration builds on earlier work between 1998 - 2001 with children and teachers in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and before that, in diverse communities in California where she was a researcher with UCLINKS, a statewide network of University of California partnerships with community organizations to promote informal learning with technology after school. She is co-editor with Sue Jansen and Jeff Pooley of Media and Social Justice (Palgrave, 2011), which includes a chapter co-authored with Media and Communication alumni Eirinn Disbrow ('10) titled, "Detours Through Youth-Driven Media:  Back Seat Drivers Bear Witness to the Ethical Dilemmas of Youth Media."  She teaches courses in documentary studies and production, new media literacies and new information technologies. Dr. Taub-Pervizpour is Muhlenberg's Associate Dean of Digital Learning and the director of the LVAIC consortial Documentary Storymaking minor program.

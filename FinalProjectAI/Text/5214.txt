Closing out games with big leads isn’t something the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team has

had a chance to work on. If the Mules play like they did for most of the game against Franklin & Marshall, however, they’ll get lots more experience.

The Mules opened up a 10-3 lead and held on for a 10-8 win, their second straight after opening the season with six consecutive losses.

Muhlenberg (2-6, 2-3) took command by scoring four goals in the last three minutes of the first half. Freshmen Clint Watkins and Corey Aferiat netted the first two goals 53 seconds apart to put Muhlenberg up to stay, 4-3.

With 37.4 seconds left in the half, senior Nick Fletcher extended the lead to 5-3 with a hard shot from straight on. The Mules won the opening faceoff when 
sophomore Tom Brant flipped the ball back over his head to a teammate. Moments later, Aferiat fed senior Andrew Lolley for a goal with 10.8 seconds to play.

Muhlenberg, which hadn’t scored more than seven goals in a game all season, added three more goals in the third quarter – two in the last minute – and another 49 seconds into the fourth. The 8-0 run gave the Mules a 10-3 advantage.

Last year, Muhlenberg led F&M 8-3 early in the fourth quarter but needed triple overtime to win. The Diplomats (3-6, 1-3) nearly pulled off another amazing comeback by scoring five unanswered goals, but the last came with 19 seconds left, and the Mules held on.

Sophomore Brent Siebold recorded his third career hat trick with three goals. Lolley, Aferiat and freshman Clint Watkins added three apiece, with Aferiat also recording two assists.

Brant and sophomore goalie Mike Horowitz picked up eight ground balls apiece. Horowitz made nine saves.

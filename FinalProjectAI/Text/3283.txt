Cross Country



The Mules competed in the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational, a unique meet that consisted of four races. The men had an 8K race and a 4K race and the women 
had a 6K and a 4K.  The winner was then determined by the combined score of the two races. 

The women were ninth in the 6K, 13th in the 4K and eighth overall. The men placed seventh in the 8K, 14th in the 4K and ninth overall.

The Muhlenberg teams had some excellent individual results in the long races. 
For the men, senior Timothy VanSyckle 
placed fith and classmate David Chorney was 14th in the 8K. In the women’s 6K, sophomore Kate Mahoney placed 10th. There were just under 200 runners in each long race with
the majority of the top teams in the region competing.

Women’s Tennis



Muhlenberg sent two doubles teams and one individual to the semifinals at the F&M Fall Invitational, a tournament consisting of only Centennial Conference
teams. Senior Jenn Powell won two singles matches, coming back after losing the first set in her quarterfinal contest. The doubles team of sophomores
Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt reached the semis with an 8-2 victory, while senior Madeleine Goldfarb teamed up with sophomore
Sara Sutker for an 8-5 win.

Men’s Golf



The Mules were tied for sixth after the first of two rounds at the Tom Kinder Invitational, hosted by Bridgewater. 
Junior Biff Slocum and sophomore Zachary Oyer each shot a 4-over-par 76 in the team’s first competition of the 2008-09 year.






The Muhlenberg volleyball team enjoyed an outstanding day in Maryland, sweeping McDaniel and Mary Washington in three sets apiece.

The victories improve the Mules’ record to 11-4, matching their win total in 30 matches from all of last season. Muhlenberg has reached double digits in victories 18 consecutive years.

Beating McDaniel on its home court was particularly impressive. Last year, the Green Terror went 8-2 in the Centennial Conference to finish in third place and qualify for the CC playoffs. The Mules defeated the Terror decisively, 25-13, 25-16, 25-8.

Freshman Jackie Price (left)recorded 12 kills in only 16 attempts for an incredible .688 hitting percentage. She had kills on all four of her attempts in both the first and third sets. 

Senior Megan Eiser orchestrated an attack that made only nine errors in 74 attempts by dishing out 29 assists. Junior Christina Cangelosi had 11 digs and four service aces, while junior Brittany Williams contributed 10 digs and four blocks.

Muhlenberg continued its hot hitting in the second match, committing only one error in the first set en route to the 3-0 shutout of Mary Washington. Junior Phylicia Lee led a balanced attack with seven kills in the match.

Field Hockey



Senior Julie deLaurentis snuck this penalty stroke inside the right post with 2:33 left in the first half, but Washington scored
three unanswered goals in the second half to spoil Muhlenberg’s Centennial Conference opener, 3-1.

After weathering an early flurry of Shorewomen penalty corners (12 in the first 20 minutes), the Mules appeared to have seized the momentum late in the first half. The goal,
the second of deLaurentis’ career, came after Washington was called for a foul following Muhlenberg’s sixth penalty corner.

Muhlenberg (1-5) had a 14-11 advantage in shots for the game, but Washington put in two goals seven minutes apart in the second half, then added an insurance marker with
54 seconds to play.

baseball win at ex-“spence” of garnet



Brewer Blast Not Enough for Softball



The struggling offense of the Muhlenberg softball team got a big boost with a big blast off the bat of freshman Ashley Brewer, but it did not translate to a win.

Brewer’s three-run homer, the first of her career, capped a four-run uprising that gave the Mules a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the fifth inning of their second game with Swarthmore. The Garnet (14-8, 3-1), a 2007 Centennial Conference playoff team, tied the game in the sixth, then scored three runs in the eighth for an extra-inning 7-4 victory.

Muhlenberg (5-17, 2-6) was held to one hit in the first game, a 2-0 loss, and had just one through the first four innings of the nightcap. Sophomore Allie Saltstein led off with the first of her two singles, crossed to third on a pair of wild pitches, and scored on a single by sophomore Jenna Van Waalwijk. Another single, by freshman Alyssa D’Addio, set the stage for Brewer’s three-run shot.

D’Addio represented the winning run when she singled to lead off the seventh and advanced to second on a sacrifice, but she got no further.

Spencer Joseph was so good, he 

upstaged another record-breaking day by Christian Conti.

The freshman right-hander allowed one run in seven innings in his first career start as the Muhlenberg baseball team evened its record with a 9-2 win at Swarthmore.

Pitching against a Garnet team that is third in the Centennial Conference with a .330 batting average, Joseph (right) gave up only three singles in earning his first career win. He did not allow more than one baserunner in any inning and faced just four batters over the minimum.

As for Conti, he merely drove in four runs with a two-run single in the third and a two-run double in the eighth. With the double, he broke the school records for extra-base hits (21) and total bases (84) in a season. 

The Mules (13-13, 4-5) scored four runs in the third, aided by a Swarthmore error on a sacrifice bunt. Two more runs crossed the plate the next inning, the second on a triple by sophomore Eric Pomroy. It was the 20th triple of the season for a Muhlenberg team that started the week fourth in Division III in three-baggers.

Pomroy finished the game 3-for-4, and senior Danny Asip crossed the plate in each of the Mules’ run-scoring innings.

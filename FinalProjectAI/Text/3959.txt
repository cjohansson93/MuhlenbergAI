Muhlenberg wins matte awardfor third year in a row















In golf, a match-play match is said to be "dormie" when one of the players achieves a lead that matches the number of holes remaining. 

When the Muhlenberg women's tennis team beat Moravian in late March it put the Mules dormie, up by five with five events to go, in the Matte Award standings.




Senior Lindsay Schmidt of the womens tennis team, junior Cody Antonini of the mens soccer team and senior Alexandra Berlin of the womens basketball team pose with the Matte trophy after representing Muhlenbergs student-athletes at the annual luncheon.

So it was fitting that the competition came down to the mens golf team, which clinched the Matte Award for the third year in a row at the Lehigh Valley Cup. 

After running away with the annual all-sports competition the past two seasons, Muhlenberg showed it could win a tight contest as well with a 9-7 victory.

Its the eighth straight season the trophy will stay in Allentown  Muhlenberg has won seven of the last eight years, with the 2007-08 competition ending in a tie.

Muhlenberg formally claimed the trophy at a luncheon attended by administrators, coaches and student-athletes from both schools.

This is what Division III athletics is all about, Muhlenberg athletic director Sam Beidleman said. We have good, hard-fought competition, but at the end of the day both teams shake hands and go their separate ways.

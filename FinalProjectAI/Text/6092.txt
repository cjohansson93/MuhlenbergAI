Senior Kevin Homan of the Muhlenberg wrestling team won his second title of the season, capturing the 149-pound bracket at the Will Abele Invitational, 
hosted by Ursinus.

All four Mule wrestlers who competed in the tournament won at least one bout. Muhlenberg finished eighth out of nine teams.

Homan (right) decisioned opponents from Hunter (6-0) and Centenary (6-3) in his first and final bouts. In between, he picked up a win by medical forfeit.

Homan has a record of 21-5 this season. His other tournament championship also came at Ursinus, at the Fall Brawl in mid-November.

At 141, junior Matt Parker came back after dropping his first bout to win back-to-back matches in the consolation bracket. His opponent was disqualified
in the next bout, but Parker could not continue and forfeited out of the consolation semifinals.

Senior John Sternlicht earned his first two wins of the season, one by pin, in the 184-pound consolation bracket. Senior Nick Pallotta
decisioned his first opponent at heavyweight.

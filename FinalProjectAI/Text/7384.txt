Women's Lacrosse Closes Home Season with Fun Senior Day Win
 Friday, April 18, 2014 - page 2







					 




The first half of their Senior Day game against Bryn Mawr wasn’t much fun for the defensive players on the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team. The Mules controlled the ball for almost the entire half, only allowing the Owls four offensive possessions, leaving the defenders to stand behind their restraining lines as spectators.

In the second half, the fun started.

All seven seniors scored, including the four who usually play defense, as Muhlenberg wrapped up its home schedule by snapping a three-game losing skid with a 21-1 win. 

One of the seniors, Michelle Certosimo was a big part of a record day in which the Mules (8-6, 2-5) tied the school record for margin of victory (set in a 24-4 win against Widener in 1987 and matched in a 21-1 defeat of Cedar Crest in 1993).



Certosimo set school records for points (12) and assists (10) in a game, assisting on five straight goals in one stretch. Her 10 assists were one short of the Centennial Conference record. She also scored her 200th point and broke the school record for assists in a season (60), which she had tied in the last game.

Junior Stephanie Umbach had five goals and three assists, breaking the school records for goals (75) and points (86) in a season. She also broke her own school and CC record with 17 draw controls, breaking another of her own school records with 82 on the season and moving to within one of the career mark.

Umbach recorded all five of her goals and 13 of her draw controls in the first half, helping stake the Mules to a 15-1 lead. Also scoring in the first half were starting senior midfielder Ally Shaffer and reserve senior attack Rachel Chinman, who found the back of the net for the fourth time in her career.

With the game well in hand, Muhlenberg started sending its senior defensive players to the offensive end in the second half.

First came Kaitlyn McCaffrey, who tied her own school record for caused turnovers in a season in Muhlenberg’s last game but got little opportunity to add to her total against Bryn Mawr (5-10, 0-8). She converted a pass from Certosimo early in the second half for her second career goal, and her first in three years.



With 10:28 left in the game, Anna Provax scored on the first shot of her four-year career to make it 19-1.

That left two senior defenders, Kelsey Mital and Veronica Maccia. For the rest of the game, the Mules ran set plays for the duo, prompting the Bryn Mawr coach to yell “watch 33 [Mital] and 22 [Maccia]!” – probably the first time either of the two was considered one of Muhlenberg’s most dangerous offensive threats.

They would not be denied. Mital scored first, with 1:30 remaining, for her second career goal. And just 13 seconds later, Maccia – who has been injured for much of the year – closed out the scoring by burying a pass from Umbach as the Muhlenberg bench erupted in cheers.

“That was really awesome,” said junior Christina Vittorio, who starts on defense with McCaffrey and Provax (left). “It was great to see them end their home careers like that. They had fun out there and that was the most important part.”

The seniors weren’t the only ones who got in on the fun – in all 15 different players scored goals, tying the school record set in the 1993 Cedar Crest game. In addition to Provax and Maccia (right), freshman Amanda Brefach netted her first career goal.

The Mules ended with a 45-4 advantage in shots in keeping their CC playoff hopes alive. In spite of their 2-5 CC record, they are very much in the playoff picture heading into their final two regular-season games at Dickinson and Ursinus.

And nothing would make their teammates happier than extending the careers of their beloved seniors with a playoff game.

“The seniors bring fun, and they have this eccentric special thing about them that brightens the team up,” said Vittorio. “They’re all great role models and best friends, and that is so important to this team. They’re really going to be missed.”

Zach Cooper â21, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce intern, outside a small business in Washington, D.C.
Zach Cooper â21 first applied for his summer internship with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last winter, when it was to be an in-person, full-time role at the Washington, D.C., headquarters. He learned he had an interview for the position the week Muhlenberg sent students home due to COVID-19, and he received word heâd been selected in April, while learning from home.
âI was in the middle of a Zoom class,â says Cooper, a political science major with a history minor. âI saw the email, read it really quick, and jumped out of my chair, celebrating, interrupting the class.â
Heâs an economic policy intern, and he and his colleagues are working remotely as the pandemic continues. The Chamber lobbies on behalf of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes: âWhether a business is a Main Street mom-and-pop shop or a major industry leader, it is the Chamberâs mission to advocate for its growth in a very divided Washington,â Cooper says. 
Though he works on many projects, Cooperâs main role involves helping to analyze data from the economic reports that come out several times per weekâdata on jobs, housing, poverty and other key economic indicators. He and his colleagues âanalyze and simplify the stats to help lead our heads of policy to come to a consensus view of what the Chamber thinks of certain congressional or executive acts,â he says.
Even though heâs not physically in the office, Cooper has had a full internship experience. He has been able to meet virtually with the heads of various policy departments once or twice a week to learn what their work consists of and how they work with the economic policy department. He feels a sense of community, among his team and among the Chamber as a whole, that he didnât expect to feel at such a large organization. While itâs been hard to see some of the data coming inâespecially the high unemployment numbers at the beginning of the pandemicâitâs been gratifying to be part of an organization thatâs looking out for businesses in an extremely challenging economic time.
âThe summerâs gone so fast,â Cooper says. âThatâs truly a testament to the great experience I've had working at the Chamber.â

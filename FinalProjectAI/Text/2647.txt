nolan receives second all-america nod



Senior center Mike Nolan of the Muhlenberg football team earned his second major honor of the summer when he was selected to the D3football.com preseason All-America team.

Nolan was a first-team pick on the D3football.com squad. Earlier in the month, he was named a preseason 
All-American by Sporting News. 

The 320-pound Nolan (right) earned first-team All-CC honors each of the last two years – his first two as an offensive lineman 
for Muhlenberg. In his two seasons as a starter, Nolan has anchored an offense that dramatically improved in both yards per game (261.8 in 2005 to 284.4 to 377.7) and 
points per game (13.8 to 20.5 to 29.7). The Mules led the CC in scoring offense and average time of possession (34:49) last year, and Nolan earned three “Big Hit” Awards from the coaching staff.

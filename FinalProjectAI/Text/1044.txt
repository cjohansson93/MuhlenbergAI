Tim Black

Muhlenberg instantly felt like a family from the first interview. I could not be more excited to be a part of a team that cares so much about student development, fostering a sense of community, and developing meaningful relationships. 
Originally from New Jersey, I received my BA of Psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University. From there I went on to receive my M. Ed. in College Student Affairs from Rutgers University- New Brunswick. My passion areas include LGBTQ communtiy, restorative justice, and supporting students through crisis.

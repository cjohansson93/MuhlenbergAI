Men's Golf Wins Tournament in Record Style


The Muhlenberg men's golf team won its own tournament for the second year in a row, setting some records along the way.


	 Wednesday, September 7, 2016  03:31 PM

Playing for the third day in a row, the Mules finished with a team score of 290 to win by 14 strokes over three teams that tied for second. The score was the lowest in team history, breaking the 293 they shot at last year's Muhlenberg Invitational.
Sophomore Ian Simon came in second with a 2-under-par 68, breaking the individual record of 69 set just two weeks ago by junior Evan Overcash at the Penn State Harrisburg Invitational. Simon opened with three pars and two bogeys on his first five holes but was four under the rest of the round. He would have set a tournament record but for a DeSales golfer who shot a 67.
Senior John Froberg (pictured at right) finished with a flourish, making long birdie putts on both 17 and 18 to come in third with an even-par 70. Froberg cut two strokes off his career low round and is one of four active Mules who has shot 70 or better.
Freshman Sam Gersten also set a personal best, shooting a 75. Overcash was two strokes behind.

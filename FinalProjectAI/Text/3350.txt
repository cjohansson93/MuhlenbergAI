Women’s Tennis Wins Sixth Straight


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team continued its roll to the Centennial Conference playoffs, shutting out Franklin & Marshall, 9-0.

It was only the second time the Mules (7-3, 6-1) blanked the Diplomats.

Muhlenberg won both contested doubles matches in decisive fashion and took all six singles matches in straight sets.

Senior Jenn Powell recorded the most one-sided wins, prevailing 8-0 at No. 1 doubles and 6-0, 6-2 at No. 1 singles. Sophomore Lindsay Schmidt scored a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 6 singles.

Danielle Winston reached the 50-win mark as a sophomore with her 6-2, 6-1 decision at No. 5 singles.

Senior Chris Costa reached base in all six plate appearances, with three singles and three walks, and scored four runs.



straight rainouts, it was time for something different for the Muhlenberg baseball team.

The Mules had no control over the weather, which turned warm and sunny, but they did over their lineup, which also was brighter. Freshmen Nick Busillo and Will Falco, both making their first career starts, combined for six hits and six RBI as Muhlenberg ended its skid with a 14-5 win at Dickinson.

The Mules (10-18-1, 4-7) pounded out 21 hits, putting the game away early with six runs in the first and three in the second.

Falco’s two-run double – his first career hit – was the big blow in the first inning. Busillo hit a two-run double in the second, one of his four hits in the game.

Sophomore Jeff Puklin, starting in center field for just the second time, knocked in two runs with a sixth-inning single.

Junior Eric Pomroy went 4-for-5 with a triple.

Muhlenberg, playing the first of eight scheduled games in six days, used six pitchers, with junior Phil Cresta tossing three scoreless innings to earn his 14th career win.

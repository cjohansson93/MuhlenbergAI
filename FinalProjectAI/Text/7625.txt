The rematch of the 2013 Centennial Conference volleyball championship match finished with the same score, 3-1, but this year it was Muhlenberg that came out on top of three-time defending champion Johns Hopkins.

It was a hard-fought contest beginning to end. Muhlenberg dropped the first set 25-17, but rebounded to take the final three, with each being decided by four points or less. 

One key to the match was service efficiency. The Mules had 10 aces and only three errors, while the Blue Jays aced 12, but collected 16 errors.

“I feel like serving is the one thing you can really control,” said senior captain Nikki Dickson. “I just go out there and try to pick out where I want to hit it, and I worked a lot on it this summer.”

Dickson (right) added to her conference-topping total in aces by landing six in the match and also tied for a team-best with 12 assists. Sophomore Allison Glass filled the stat sheet with a team-high 13 kills, while adding three blocks and 10 digs. Junior Katherine Boll struck down 11 kills.

“Our offense is really strong and well rounded, so we can attack from anywhere on the court,” said Dickson. “We can pass to really any attacker on the floor and get points.”

Muhlenberg (15-2, 3-0) has now won eight matches in a row, its longest winning streak since 1995, and has beaten the 2013 regular-season champion (Franklin & Marshall) and tournament champion in the past 10 days. In both contests the Mules trailed 1-0 to start the matches.

“We’ve been staying aggressive and really working as a team,” added Dickson about the team’s ability to overcome setbacks. “Even when we have had slow starts, we have made adjustments and done a good job of bouncing back.”

The win is the first match of a season-ending stretch in which the Mules play 12 of their final 15 contests on the road. 

“As things get tougher we just need to continue to focus and play as a team,” continued Dickson. “If we do that it will really help us down the line.”

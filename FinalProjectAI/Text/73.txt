The Music Department at Muhlenberg College is unique, offering outstanding vocal and instrumental training and the performance opportunities you would expect from a larger School of Music.
Students involved with music at Muhlenberg receive personal attention from our faculty. We work with our students to help them achieve their goals as musicians within the intellectually challenging but supportive environment of one of the nationâs leading liberal arts institutions. Our department offers courses as  diverse as Electronic Music, World Music, Women in Music, Haydn and Mozart, History of Jazz, Techniques of the Avant Garde and the Music Senior Seminar.
Whether you are planning to major in music in preparation for graduate studies, explore courses in our department as a non-major, or express your passion for music as a member of the Choir or Wind Ensemble, you will be a welcome part of Music at Muhlenberg.

The Collegeâs annual Earth Day celebration is expanding this year to a week of events. The programs provide opportunities for the campus community to learn about the complicated relationships between plants and people from the RJ Fellow Program seniors, join a biophilic design workshop led by the architects of the new Community Parkway Building and celebrate Earth Day with College and community groups on the Quad.
Monday, April 19, noonâ1 p.m.Join the virtual workshop and lecture, Biophilic Design & Living Building Challenge at Muhlenberg, presented by the architects of the new Community Parkway Building.
Drew Lavine, Principal, Re:Vision Architecture, will discuss how the new building on the south side of campus will connect people to nature via biophilic design. âThe Living Building Challenge is innovative in that it incorporates place, health and wellness, equity and beauty into the design criteria as well as the rigorous sustainability metrics of energy, water and materials,â says Sustainability Coordinator Kalyna Procyk.

The College recognizes the value of our community supporting each other.  As we navigate an active, global pandemic, this viewpoint is necessary.  The MulesCare Pandemic Safety Ambassador Program was developed to help us maintain a shared responsibility in keeping all members of our community safe. 
The groupâs purpose is two-fold:

To educate and positively reinforce the collegeâs pandemic (COVID-19 in this case) policy and guidelines
To advocate for the communityâs needs

The MulesCare Pandemic Safety Ambassador program will be overseen by the Pandemic Safety Officers (PSO).
If you are interested in joining the Ambassador program, please click on this link.  It will take you to a brief application form.







FAQs



          Who is eligible to be an ambassador?
  








Students who are living on campus or have permission to be on campus may serve as an ambassador.  The working group will develop opportunities for off campus and remote students to participate in the program in the future.
Employees, who are working on campus, are eligible to serve as ambassadors as long as they can fulfill the expectations of their regular position and their supervisor sends an email of support to Human Resources (hr@muhlenberg.edu).






          What skills do you need to have?  Will there be training?
  








You need to understand and support the Collegeâs COVID-19 policies and expectations.  You do not need any special knowledge in public health, safety, or emergency response.
You will complete a one-hour training provided by a PSO which will cover some information about the virus, the collegeâs policy, opportunities to positively reinforce behaviors that align with the collegeâs policy, and if necessary, how to approach a person or group about a concern.






          How will ambassadors be scheduled?
  








Ambassadors will provide their availability at the training session.  A schedule will be developed based on the availability of the ambassadors and the Collegeâs needs.  
Ambassadors should expect to complete one to two shifts per week.  Shifts last 2 hours at a time.  You will have a partner for each shift.






          What will I be asked to do as an ambassador?
  








You should lead by example in your own actions and decisions while helping campus community members (students, faculty and staff) understand how their individual decisions influence our shared responsibility to keep each other safe.  During their shift, Ambassadors should be prepared to remind campus members of the following:

Wear a paper or cloth mask compliant with Muhlenberg Collegeâs Mandatory Face Mask/Covering Policy, covering mouth and nose at all times both inside buildings and outside. Masks with vents and gaiters are not permitted on campus.


Practice social distancing by maintaining 6 feet of distance from others, especially when entering or existing classrooms and buildings and when crossing streets.
Complete the Daily Self-Assessment questions on the Muhlenberg app.
Clean their desk/work areas and equipment with provided sanitizer wipes and take special care when using common and shared equipment.
Cooperate with the Health Center team (students) if contacted for random testing or contact tracing and Human Resources (employees) if contacted for contact tracing.
Provide a mask to any campus member who forgot, lost or damaged their mask while on campus
Walk through assigned areas during your shift.
Provide the committee a summary of what you observed on your shift.







          What do I do if someone is not following the Collegeâs policy or guidelines?
  









Provide a friendly reminder to encourage compliance.
All community members have the ability to submit a report about concerns they witness using this form.

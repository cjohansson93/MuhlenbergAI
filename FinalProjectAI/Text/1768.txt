Trexler Library is open for virtual/remote services and continues to support all students, faculty, and staff with their research needs. 
Library staff will only checkout material through our Contactless Checkout service, but faculty and staff will be able to physically retrieve requested materials and to utilize library spaces 10 am -3 pm, Monday through Thursday during January 2021. Faculty and staff will use their Muhlenberg ID to swipe in. You may virtually browse our collection and place holds to check out material. You will then be notified when you can pick-up your resources in the library. For students, faculty, and staff who do not live nearby, we can continue to mail resources to you as needed. Please view the  PDF instructions or video overview for a detailed look at the process for virtually browsing and to place holds.
To reserve the One Button Studio or Collaboration Room to record lectures or develop your course, please use our online reservation system.
Should you have any questions or wish to reserve the one-button studio at other times, please email library@muhlenberg.edu.

women’s lax snows king’s in opener



A flurry of goals and snow awaited the valiant spectators who came to the home opener of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team for the 2008 campaign.

The Mules steamrolled visiting King’s, 20-10, scoring 20 home goals for first time since the 2003 season, when they defeated Cedar Crest, 24-7.

“We played really well as a unit today,” 



Armstrong fires a shot past Lady Monarch goalie Heather Kelly for her fourth goal of the game.



said sophomore Alyssa Bascelli. “We had a lot of clean transitions and showed great chemistry as a team.”

That chemistry led to Mules tying a school record with 13 assists, amassed by 10 different players.

The Mules didn’t waste time opening the score as junior Megan Wilson set up senior Taylor Armstrong five minutes into the game. 

Muhlenberg was in total domination during the first 15 minutes of the first half, jumping to a 6-0 lead thanks to goals by Bascelli, junior Ruth Morrongiello, 
sophomore Amanda McGovern and two more by Armstrong. 

The teams exchanged goals in the next 13 minutes and the Mules maintained their 6-goal lead, 9-3, before freshman Danielle Rosen commemorated her first career 
game for Muhlenberg with a goal in the last minute before the interval. 

Bascelli and Armstrong added two goals for the Mules in the first two minutes of the second half, making the score 12-3. 

After a pair of King’s goals, snowflakes started falling and rapidly covered the field, but that wasn’t an obstacle for the Muhlenberg offense, 
which scored six of the next eight goals, establishing an 18-7 lead 12 minutes into the second half.

“The bad weather wasn’t anything new for us,” said Bascelli, who scored a hat trick and dished out two assists for the hosts. “We are used to it now as we’ve 
played in worse conditions.”

The Mules slowed down the pace in the final minutes, additionally hampered by the slippery field. Senior Marissa Capuano wrapped up the 20-10 victory with a goal
in the final seconds.

Armstrong finished with a career-high six goals, while Morrongiello contributed four goals and registered a team-high seven ground balls. 
McGovern tallied four points for the Mules, who played in February for first time in school’s history.

The Muhlenberg track and field teams had a busy weekend, competing in three different meets. 

The three Mules who traveled to Bucknell to compete in the Bison Outdoor Classic all enjoyed great success. Sophomore Melanie Tramontina
improved her personal record in the 5,000 meters by nearly 15 seconds, finishing sixth and climbing from ninth to seventh on the all-time performance list.
Senior Nicki Cronin PR’d by four seconds in the 1,500, moving from fifth to fourth on the performance list. Both recorded ECAC-qualifying times.

Junior Luke Munyan entered the performance list in 10th place with his personal best in the 5,000.

Senior Scott Reutter competed in a decathlon at Kutztown on Thursday and Friday, then joined the rest of the team on Saturday at Moravian’s Coach P Open, running a leg on the 4x100 team that finished seventh.

Sophomore Claire Thornton was the top finisher at Moravian, coming in second in a field of 50 with an ECAC-qualifying time in the 800. She jumped onto the performance list in sixth place.
Senior Stephanie Carnevale (110 hurdles), junior Tyler Bauer (javelin) and sophomore Daniel Cano (discus) also
posted season-best ECAC-qualifying marks.

Freshman Jaryd Flank (right) ran the ninth-fastest steeplechase in program history in his first time competing in the event as a Mule.

One match could not have been more competitive, and the other could not have been less so, but the end result was a split for the Muhlenberg tennis teams at McDaniel. The women nearly completed a total sweep at McDaniel, dropping only three games combined in improving to 4-2 in Centennial Conference play with their second league shutout of the season, while the men were outlasted, 5-4, in a nailbiter that came down to a third set on the last court.

All three women’s doubles teams won their pro sets at love.  Seniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman prevailed at first doubles, while freshman Sara Finger and junior Sharen Resnikoff won at second and junior Jennifer Goldberg (right) and freshman Jamie Rosenblum teamed up to repeat the feat at No. 3.

Szulman (No. 2), Goldberg (No. 3), Rosenblum (No. 5) and junior Dani Yaron (No. 6) all won their singles matches by 6-0, 6-0 scores. It was Rosenblum’s fourth consecutive shutout.

The men’s match came down to the wire, but McDaniel came through for its first victory over the Mules since 1982.

Bidding for its first CC victory of the season, Muhlenberg trailed, 4-2, with three matches to play and nearly pulled off the comeback before coming up just short. Sophomore Neil Shulman posted a 6-3, 6-3 victory at No. 6 singles in his first action of the spring, and junior Eric Chavis rallied from a set down at No. 4 to take the third set, 6-4, and knot the contest at 4-all. But the Green Terror came out on top in the final matchup of the day to cap its milestone win.

Senior Ben Berkowitz and sophomore Derrick Eng captured a 9-8 decision at third doubles for the Mules, and junior Daniel Lakhman was a straight-sets winner at first singles.

torphy named to academicall-district team


Muhlenberg rising junior Bobby Torphy was named to the 2008-09 ESPN the Magazine 
Academic All-District II College Division track & field/cross country team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 

A first-team selection, Torphy will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America honors.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of 
Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a 
sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his team. 

A biochemistry major, Torphy earned All-America honors in indoor track and field by running on the distance medley relay team that placed fourth at NCAA 
Division III Championships. He contributed to indoor school records in the DMR and 4x800, winning gold medals in both relays at the Centennial
Conference Championships. Torphy added another gold outdoors by anchoring the 4x800, and individually he won silver (outdoors) and bronze (indoors) medals
in the 800.

In cross country, Torphy was the Mules’ third runner all season and finished third at the Mule/Falcon Classic. A member of Pre-Health Club, Torphy
performs volunteer work at Lehigh Valley Hospital.

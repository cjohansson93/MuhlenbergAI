Mayden Ties Mile Record; Men's Basketball and Wrestling Fall
 Saturday, February 2, 2013 - page 2







					 


Senior Samantha Mayden tied the school record in the mile to lead the Muhlenberg track and field teams at Lehigh’s John Covert Classic.



Mayden won the race in 4:59.30, matching the mark set by Jennifer Lynch on a banked track three years ago. Since Mayden ran on a flat track, she technically ran faster.
Entering this weekend’s meets, only one runner in Division III had posted a better time this season. 

Less than two hours after her record-tying mile run, Mayden came back to post an ECAC-qualifying time and indoor career best of 2:21.53 while finishing third in the 800.

Senior Erica Bash finished right behind Mayden in both races, second with a personal-best time in the mile and fourth in the 800.

Freshman Melanie Tramontina (left) qualified for ECACs in the 3,000 meters, finishing third with the sixth-best time on the Mules’s performance list.

Senior Isaiah Vaughn logged third-place finishes in both sprinting events for the men’s team, while freshman Alex Weiner and
sophomore Kieran Newcomb went 4-5 in the mile.

Men’s Basketball: Muhlenberg suffered through a rough offensive day and lost at Franklin & Marshall, 68-46. The Mules (12-9, 8-6)
shot just 29.2 percent, and the 46 points were their fewest against a Division III opponent in five years.

Sophomore Malique Killing scored eight of his team-high 18 points in an 11-0 first half run that erased a 20-9 deficit, but the Diplomats (16-5, 11-3)
scored the last seven points of the first half and the first five of the second to build a double-digit lead that stood for the rest of the game.


With two weeks to go in the regular season, Muhlenberg is tied with Gettysburg for fourth place in the Centennial Conference, two games ahead of McDaniel for the final
playoff spot.

Wrestling: A pair of pins by senior Chris Galletta highlighted the Mules’s first matches in Memorial Hall
in two years. Giving up 30 points on forfeits in each match, Muhlenberg lost to 20th-ranked New York University, 46-9, and Gettysburg, 42-12.

Galletta’s match against NYU was scoreless after the first period. He started the second period in the down position and got a reversal and quick pin about a
minute into the period. In the Gettysburg match, Galletta converted his first takedown into a pin with 1:50 elapsed. He has a 10-5 record with a team-leading five pins.

The Mules’ other win in a contested bout came from senior Matt Parker (right) at 149 against NYU. Parker scored a takedown with 54 seconds
left in the first period and successfully warded off several takedown attempts by his opponent in the final two periods to come away with a 3-0 win.

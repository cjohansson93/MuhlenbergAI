Pini's Pair Gives Women's Soccer Overtime Win
 Tuesday, October 28, 2014 - page 2







					 




Overtime is turning into the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team’s time.

The Mules tied a school record with their third overtime win of the season, improving their record to 11-4-2 when
Taylor Pini scored her second goal of the game with 4:18 left in the first overtime for
a 2-1 victory over Moravian.

It was the second time in a week that the Mules won on a “Golden Goal,” and it gave Muhlenberg a 4-0
lead in the 2014-15 Matte Award standings. Field hockey will try to make it 5-0 when it hosts Moravian tomorrow.

The winning goal was set up when junior Tori Dowd won a ball in the midfield and passed off to 
freshman Carly DeNigris, who sent a pass to Pini on the right wing. The fleet junior used a dummy,
then spun around and beat her defender to the ball.

She dribbled down the sideline before sending the ball into the goal area. Junior Jacelin Muschlitz
made a move to the ball that distracted the goalie, and the ball somehow spun into the back of the net.

Pini also scored the first goal of the game (right), with 11:18 left in regulation, after taking a pass from senior
Colleen Touhey. The Greyhounds (7-9-1) tied the game on a breakaway with just 6:43 to play.

Freshman Rachel Mizrahi made a pair of saves to pick up the win and was helped out by 
junior Megan Nehila, who used her left foot to clear a shot out of the goal and keep the game
scoreless midway through the second half.

Muhlenberg, ranked 10th in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the NSCAA, previously won three overtime games in 2001.

Holly Roadfeldt

Since making her orchestral debut with the Toledo Symphony Orchestra at the age of 13, PARMA recording artist Holly Roadfeldt has continued to be an active solo pianist and chamber musician performing standard and eclectic recital programs in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Hollyâs mission is to inspire and advocate for piano music of the highest caliber and she regularly mixes newly composed music with established masterpieces. For her recent three-year endeavor âThe Preludes Projectâ, Holly commissioned 16 composers to write preludes to be performed alongside works from the standard repertoire. Holly premiered 64 preludes in 16 states as a guest artist at multiple venues including Oklahoma State University, Wichita State University; the Peabody Conservatory of Music; University of Nebraska-Kearney; Western Carolina University; Carson-Newman University; the College of Southern Maryland; Westminster College; the University at Albany; Manchester University and Lafayette College.
The Preludes Project CD is Hollyâs debut solo album, produced and recorded by multi-GRAMMYÂ® award winner, Andreas Meyer, and was released by PARMA Recordings in November 2016. The double CD includes Chopinâs Op. 28 Preludes and Kirk OâRiordanâs Twenty-Six Preludes for Solo Piano (2014). Hollyâs performance on this CD has been lauded as âutterly convincing [with]â¦every note of her Chopin sound [ing] fresh and alive and her varied touch perfectly match [ing] the mood of each piece â and all are conjured up with a breathtaking sense of elation.â (Raul da Gama, World Music Report).
A dedicated performer of contemporary music, Holly has premiered over 150 solo and chamber works.  In 1996, she was awarded the prize for the "Best Performance of a 20th Century American Composition" in the Frinna Awerbuch International Piano Competition, which resulted in a performance in Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall. Additional contemporary music honors include being a semi-finalist in the Concert Artists Guild International Competition in 1998 and 2001 as a contemporary music specialist. 
As a chamber musician, Holly has performed with members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic, the Colorado Orchestra, and the Utah Symphony as well as with concert artists Alexa Still, Bonita Boyd, and Marcia Baldwin.
Holly currently teaches at both Muhlenberg and Lafayette Colleges and serves as Artist Faculty with Distinction at The Music School of Delaware. Previously, she taught at the University of Delaware, Susquehanna University, Gettysburg College, the University of Colorado-Boulder, and Indiana University.
Holly received performance degrees from the Eastman School of Music (B.M.), Indiana University (M.M.) and the University of Colorado in Boulder (D.M.A.).

Welcome to Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies!

If you are looking for a school that truly understands the adult learner, I encourage you to visit the School of Continuing Studies. All of our advisors were adult students themselves and will work with you to meet your unique educational goals.
Our classrooms are full of energy. Our professors bring us years of experience and facilitate in such a way to also share the experiences of our students, so that all may learn from them. Our classroom size is small and we encourage experiential learning methods, so that you can take what you learn in the classroom and apply it to the real world: to your life and to your work.

Through the School of Continuing Studies, you can earn a bachelorâs degree in any of over 25 majors, an associate's degree or a certificate. Many degrees are offered entirely through evening and weekend study. Our tuition is competitive with other local institutions and our programs are eligible for TRA / WIDA / OVR, Federal Financial Aid and GI BillÂ® (Yellow Ribbon Program). 
In addition, we offer tuition deferment to our students who have employer tuition remission.
Our beautiful campus is centrally located in the Lehigh Valley, easily accessible to major highways. Our office is open during hours that are convenient to you and our class schedules are flexible to meet the needs of our busy students.
If Muhlenberg sounds like it might be the place for you, please give us a call, email us or stop in to see us. We look forward to meeting you and helping you on your way to making your dream for a college degree or certificate a reality.
Sincerely,
Jane E. Hudak, M.Ed.  Dean, Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies

Drop-In Center
The Goal of all Tutorial Sessions:

To Help Students…



Develop a rough draft, revise a draft, or edit the final version of a written assignment
Organize an essay, research paper, lab report, or other writing assignment
Understand and learn how to correct grammar and punctuation errors
Develop or evolve a thesis and weave evidence into an argument


Writing Center Tutorials : Provide students with drop-in tutorial sessions that usually last 30 minutes on a first-come, first-served basis. Tutors address the student’s ideas, organization and correctness as fully as possible in the time specified, focusing on making the student a better writer by emphasizing process, not product.

The event is free and open to the public and will take place at 7 p.m., Wednesday, January 31, in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum.
With an impressive track record that spans over 25 years of expertise across the private, public and nonprofit sectors and a focus on building communities and helping them thrive, the upcoming lecture by  Taylor will give the audience some insights into what ethics, leadership and global citizenship look like in the context of an increasingly interconnected world.
Drawing upon his extensive experience in the for profit, nonprofit and government sectors, Taylor will discuss the current prospects for todayâs college students, including a framing of the political, economic and social environment and opportunities. He will identify the personal skills and attributes that will be cornerstones of a fulfilling and successful career in the 21st century.
Taylor is the former chief executive officer of My Brotherâs Keeper Alliance (MBK Alliance), a nonprofit launched by the White House and President Obama to advance communities of color broadly and boys and men of color more specifically.
Prior to joining MBK Alliance, Taylor served as a member of the Starbucks Coffee Companyâs senior leadership team. He led all corporate social responsibility and government affair functions while also serving as the executive vice president of Starbucks Global Partner Resources and also served as chief community officer and president of the Starbucks Foundation, where he led Starbuckâs efforts to help communities thrive globally in more than 60 countries.
From 2002 to 2005, Taylor was the executive vice president of College Summit, a national college access initiative with a track record of nearly doubling the college enrollment rates of low-income students.
In 2014, Taylor was recognized by Fast Company Magazine as one of the nationâs most creative senior executives. He was also named a PR Week Top 50 Innovator (2013), a Non Profit Times Top 50 CEO (2008, 2009) and one of the UCLA Anderson Graduate Schoolâs Top 100 graduates. For his groundbreaking entrepreneurial work, he was named as the state of Californiaâs Mass Mutual Blue-Chip Entrepreneur of the Year (1999).
Taylor holds a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he recently completed a six-year term as a trustee and an M.B.A. in marketing and entrepreneurial studies from UCLAâs Anderson Graduate School of Management, where he was recently named as one of the schoolâs most inspirational alumni (Top 100 Inspirational Alumni).
This event is sponsored by the Offices of the President, Provost, Advancement, Career Center, Dean of Students, Multicultural Life and the departments of Economics and Political Science.

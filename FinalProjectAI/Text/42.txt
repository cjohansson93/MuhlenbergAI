The Days of the Dead and All Saints' Day are solemn days of remembrance for Christians. They are also days for happy memories of those who have gone before us, days to contemplate life's fragile beauty, days to strengthen the bonds that connect us all, here now and already gone.
For more than a decade now, we have created a community altar at Muhlenberg College so that we can remember and share. The altar is built with many hands --student hands, our neighbors' hands, artists' hands. 
We invite the community to take part -- in whatever way you feel inspired to partake -- in the series of events around the creation of the altar.

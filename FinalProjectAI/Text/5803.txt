women’s soccer completes 2-0 weekend


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team gave up several important late goals to opponents
in its first few games, but this weekend it was the Mules who owned the second half.

Second-half goals by freshmen 
Rachael Goldstein and Valerie Patriarca gave Muhlenberg (4-1-2) its second win of the weekend, 2-0 at Neumann.

As in Saturday’s 2-1 victory against McDaniel, the Mules had a big advantage in shots (26-8) in their first meeting with the Knights, but had trouble putting the ball
in the net. Three Muhlenberg shots hit the post before Goldstein finally broke the ice with 13:58 left in the second half. Sophomore Jennifer Lynch (pictured at left) assisted
on the goal for her first career point.

A little more than two minutes later, Patriarca converted a penalty kick for her team-leading fifth goal of the season.

After playing three games in five days, the Mules have a little break before returning to action at Haverford on September 25.

Biography
After teaching at Hendrix College (a small liberal arts college in Conway, Arkansas) for three years, I came to Muhlenberg College in 2007. During my Ph.D. program at Johns Hopkins University (a research university in Baltimore, Maryland), I specialized in number theory. More specifically, I am interested in Euler systems of Heegner points of elliptic curves and their applications in Shafarevich-Tate groups, as well as the distribution of zeros of various L-functions in a function fields setting. More generally, I am interested in anything related to prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.

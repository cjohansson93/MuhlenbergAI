Field Hockey, Women's Soccer Record Shutout Wins
 Saturday, September 6, 2014 - page 3







					 





The Muhlenberg field hockey and women’s soccer teams continued their exceptional defensive play to start the season, posting 1-0 home wins in non-league play.

Field hockey recorded its first shutout of the season in defeating Elizabethtown, a team that opened the year with one-goal losses to two teams ranked in the top 15 in Division III. The Mules have allowed only two goals in three games, and in their last 204 minutes, the lone goal they conceded was on a penalty stroke.



Muhlenberg (2-1) had a 13-11 deficit in shots, but senior Sierra Lenker made seven saves in posting her fourth career shutout. 

Sophomore Emily Boyle scored the lone goal of the game, putting in a rebound (left) for her second goal in as many games with 22:10 left in the second half.



The Blue Jays had two penalty corners and two shots with a chance to tie the rest of the way, but the Mule defense held strong in ending a three-game series losing streak.

Women’s soccer completed its second straight 2-0 weekend by shutting out Gwynedd Mercy in a game that was stopped with 4:57 left in the second half due to lightning. Muhlenberg is 4-0 for just the second time in program history (the first was 2008) and has allowed only one goal in the four games.

The Mules held a commanding 30-2 edge in shots but ultimately needed some help to break into the scoring column. A Gwynedd Mercy player blocked a shot with time winding down in the second half, but in trying to clear the ball away, she hit it into the back of a teammate, from where it went into the net for an own goal.

Sophomore Tori Gonzalez made two saves to notch her first career shutout. At right, senior Leah Messler battles for possession.

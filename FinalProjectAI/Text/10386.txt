Muhlenberg students receive the best possible liberal arts education, they learn from highly skilled professors and have the opportunity to immerse themselves in hundreds of opportunities that ensure a rich college experience.  However, this life-changing experience comes at a cost and we want to ensure access for every qualified candidate who applies.
An investment in financial aid is one that pays large dividends. Students with stronger academic pedigrees increase the Collegeâs prominence and make the greatest impact in the world.
You can make a significant difference in someone's life by making either an endowed or current gift to financial aid.
For more information, contact Louis Diez, executive director of annual giving.

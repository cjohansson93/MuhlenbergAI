Muhlenberg College has been a member institution of Phi Beta Kappa (PBK) since 1967. The national honor society, a distinguished fellowship of scholars devoted to liberal education and intellectual pursuits, was established at the College of William and Mary in 1776.

Strict eligibility guidelines, including completion of specific course requirements and placement in the top 15 percent of the graduating class, mean that inductees are among the highest-achieving students at Muhlenberg.
"Founded at a slave-owning college Phi Beta Kappa's roots are steeped in systemic injustice and racism," said Sprayberry, who noted that it took 100 years before the society admitted its first Black member and did not admit its first Black woman until 1899. "Phi Beta Kappa still struggles to diversify its ranks. In acknowledgment of that, the national society included a special initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in its most recent strategic plan released in 2018. The Phi chapter of Muhlenberg is actively working to further this important initiative."
âWhen we broaden our perspectives, when we acknowledge that our ways of knowing hold truthâbut they do not exclude other ways of knowingâwhen we make room for diverse perspectives, for diverse ideas and thoughts to come into our understanding of the world, the world becomes a safer and better place for the people around us and hopefully, eventually, for the planet and everyone else residing here with us,â said Sprayberry in her closing remarks. âAnd that to me, is what is most important about you coming into the society. What I see as most important about Phi Beta Kappa is a dedication to knowledge explorationâand most importantly curiosity and open-mindednessâso as you move forward away from Muhlenberg and away from us, please hold that curiosity, that diversity of thought and that spark with you.â

Professor of Chemistry at Hofstra University, on Thursday, October 21, 2010 at 7 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. His talk, “The Ethical Dilemmas of the Manhattan Project Scientists,” is free and open to the public.
Cassidy explores the history of physics and the atomic bomb projects in the United States and Germany. In his studies he examines how scientists have responded to difficult moral and political situations and how their work has shaped modern culture.
Cassidy has written a number of books, for example, his book Uncertainty: The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg, has been translated into a number of different foreign languages. Some of his other published works are: J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century and Einstein and Our World.   He is the winner of Pfizer Award of the History of Science Society and Science Writing Award of the American Institute of Physics.
This talk is part of a year-long series of events, Science and Sensibility: Studying Nature as a Human Endeavor, directed by Dr. Bruce Wightman, Professor of Biology.

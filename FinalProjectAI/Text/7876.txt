Kaser Builds on Milestone as Volleyball Sweeps Moravian
 Wednesday, October 1, 2014 - page 2







					 




Since offensive players generally get the glory and defensive players are often overlooked, perhaps it was only fitting that junior Chelsea Kaser of the Muhlenberg volleyball team didn’t find out about a major career milestone until four days after it happened.

Kaser (left) became the 11th player in program history to reach 1,000 digs in the Mules’ 3-1 win at defending Centennial Conference champion Johns Hopkins on Saturday. She learned about the accomplishment hours before her team’s next match, then proceeded to add to her total with a match-high 12 digs in a 3-0 win at Moravian.

“It’s really cool because I had no idea I was even approaching it,” she said. “It was the icing on the cake on top of beating Hopkins.”

As for the delayed recognition, she was cool with that too. It helped that she saw much of her achievement in the headlines that the hitters get.

“I really think that we’re the backbone of the team,” said Kaser of the back-row players. “You couldn’t get that kill if there wasn’t a pass.”

Kaser, who was a setter in high school, made the quick transition to libero, earning All-CC honors in each of her first two seasons. She was on pace to break the school record for digs by a freshman two years ago before suffering a season-ending injury and is only the second player in program history to reach 1,000 digs as a junior.

“I attribute a lot to the blockers. They make my job easier,” she said. “I only have to cover a certain part of the court.

“I would get a lot more digs if our blockers weren’t so good, but I would much rather not.”

Although the Mules didn’t put up big blocking numbers against Moravian, they held the Greyhounds to a low hitting percentage. After winning the back-and-forth first set, 25-20, Muhlenberg had an easier time in the next two, winning 25-16 and 25-13. 

The third set started with sophomore Elizabeth Garrison serving the first 10 points, and she later had a service run of four points.

Junior Joanne Josephson led the attack with nine kills in only 10 attempts, and sophomore Allison Glass served five of the Mules’ 10 aces.

The Mules also defeated Moravian at Neumann’s tournament in mid-September; this is the first time since 1982 that Muhlenberg has beaten its local rival twice in the same season.

The win gave Muhlenberg a 2-0 lead in the Matte Award standings for the 2014-15 year. The next Matte contest is a men’s golf match on Monday.

The win also extended the volleyball team’s record to 16-2 for the first time ever. Muhlenberg has won nine in a row – tied for the second-longest streak in program history, two short of the school record – and will turn its attention back to the Centennial Conference with a home match against Dickinson on Saturday.

A win would put the Mules at 4-0 in the CC and keep them at the top of the standings. And that’s more important than any statistical milestone. 

“We have so much chemistry this year,” said Kaser. “Our energy is just great.”

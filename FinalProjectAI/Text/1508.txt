Stay Smart
2400 Chew
2400 CHEW is a biweekly series of fresh and future-focused conversations emphasizing the current work of alumni, their take on industry trends and how their own work will address, complement, or facilitate those progressions.
Alumni Travel
Why not study abroad with an alumni travel experience? There is a trip for every travel level and at every age. Past destinations include Russia, Ireland and Italy. New options will be added in the not-so-distant future.
Book Club
The love of learning continues beyond graduation, and so does the pursuit of new ideas and inspiration. Joining the alumni-exclusive, virtual book club is a great way to connect with others at no cost and discuss common interests.
Lifelong Learning at Alumni Weekend
Fascinating explorations with superb faculty allow you to enjoy those stimulating days as a student (but without the tests or homework). Spend an hour or an entire afternoon pondering intriguing questions about everything from papyrus to politics. 
Center For Ethics
Through thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural and scientific issues. Browse their site for upcoming events and a video archive of past events.
Summer Deep Dives
Go back to college from July - August with free, virtual non-credit classes exclusively for alumni. These month-long mini-courses taught by Muhlenberg faculty will keep you sharp and satisfy your curiosity. Space is limited. 2022 course offerings will be announced soon.
For questions on any of these programs,  email bergalum@muhlenberg.edu. 
Culture on Campus
Martin Art Gallery

Theatre & Dance and Summer Music Theatre
The Theatre & Dance and the Summer Music Theatre programs serve as an artistic home to some of the region's most talented designers, choreographers and directors with an impressive array of professional credits and interests.

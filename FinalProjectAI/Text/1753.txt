Trexler Library offers printing, photocopying, and scanning services from several locations within the library.
Printing:
Option 1: In efforts to cut down on wasteful printing, Muhlenberg Collegeâs uses the cloud-based printing system PaperCut. There are four Ricoh multifuncitonal printer units that are equipped in Trexler Library:

On the A-level concourse along the left side wall (Color)
On the A-level concourse (Color) near the Reference Desk
By the main entrance of B-level (Color)
By the study carrols on C-level along the east wall of the building

To learn more about the PaperCut touch-free cloud-based printing system, please visit the College's printing information page. 
        

        Option 2: Trexler Library has a multifunctional printer/copier on A-level that is open to the public. This unit is controlled by a coin tower that accepts change and dollar bills. It is $0.10 for each B&W page and $0.25 for each color page. Files must be saved on a USB and either a PDF or JPEG format.
Copying:
Current Muhlenberg students, facutly, and staff can utilize any PaperCut-equipped multifunctional printer to make copies as well.
Trexler Library has a multifunctional printer/copier on A-level that is open to the public. This unit is controlled by a coin tower that accepts change and dollar bills. It is $0.10 for each B&W page and $0.25 for each color page. This unit can conduct both single page copies as well as duplex copies.
Scanning:
Book/Document Scanner:
Trexler Library has two scanners (B&W/Color) on A-level concourse; one near the Information Services Desk and one along the west wall near the elevator alcove. Scanned documents can be sent directly to an email address or stored to (USB/SD/MicroSD). This scanner was programmed to send scanned documents a @muhlenberg.edu email address and therefore Trexler Library cannot guarantee scanned documents will reach other email addresses.
Please note, copyright guidelines all operate within the concept of fair use, described in detail within our Copyright Primer.
Microfilm Scanner:
At the end of the row of computers located on the A-level concourse, Trexler Library owns a Microfilm Scanner as a way to read archived newspapers and government documents that have been preserved as both microfilm and microfiche. Users are able to save/print captured frames viewed on the Microfilm Scanner. Directions can be found near the Scanner itself and help is available at the Lending Services desk.

With the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team down 3-1 in the second half, senior captain Lance Dotzman pulled his team into a huddle to regroup.

“All I said was we had to pick it up,” said Dotzman. “I told them to play for the person next to you and play as a family. I feel we did that and it showed in the end.”


The Mules (9-1-2, 4-1-1) showed a lot after coming back to win, 4-3.

The comeback was sparked by senior Travis Wantchekon in the 73rd minute. Wantchekon made a run down the far sideline and rocketed a searing shot passed the shoulder of the keeper to bring the Mules within one goal.

“I knew I was going to take a hit the entire time,” said Wantchekon (left). “I take that shot all the time in practice, and the goalies hate it. So I figured I would take one towards the keeper and see if he could save it.”


Less than five minutes later sophomore Nick Sarkos was pulled down from behind in the box, resulting in penalty kick and a red card. Dotzman (right) stood over the ball and sent it in to tie the score at 3-3.

“I appreciated Sarkos getting me on the penalty spot,” continued Dotzman. “At that point you just have to be calm and sink one in for your team.”

Just 2:40 later sophomore Phil Rahling calmly sent a shot rolling to the far post and in to give Muhlenberg the lead for good, 4-3. The goal set off a massive celebration with the student section and fans in the stands, and the celebration continued through the final whistle.

Muhlenberg stayed in third place and put four points between itself and fourth-place Haverford (8-5, 3-3) in the Centennial Conference standings with the win. The Mules are in good shape to make the CC playoffs with three league games remaining.

“The team is pumped up [after this win],” added Dotzman, “and we are ready to move on to TCNJ. It is really great for morale and we are that much closer to the conference tournament.”

Freshman Anthony Carracino scored the first goal of the game for the Mules off a rebound from a Wantchekon shot. The Mules conceded most of the scoring chances after taking the early 1-0 lead, but that all changed during the flurry of three goals in 14 minutes.

One huge defensive play made during those 14 minutes was a headed save by sophomore Jack Dusing after the Wantchekon goal. Dusing got his head to a ball right before it crossed the touchline and sent it safely out of play, keeping the deficit at one goal.

“This win is just another small step towards a possible conference title,” said Wantchekon. “We have to keep taking it all in stride, not celebrate too much, and move on to the next game.”

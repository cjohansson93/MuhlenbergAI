Muhlenberg College Faculty & Staff Campaign
Why is participation important? Your gift to The Muhlenberg Fund (TMF) has a direct impact on the College's ability to respond to the pressing needs of our students and the campus community including financial aid, student and faculty research, physical plant improvements and more. Your participation in the Faculty & Staff Campaign sends a message to other prospective donors that we highly value Muhlenberg College's contribution of qualified graduates to the global community. Finally, many gifts to the College are positively influenced by the knowledge that its employees are so supportive.Where does my money go? TMF supports our beautiful campus and modern facilities. Because the cost to educate our students costs more than what most of them actually pay, TMF kicks in to help bridge the gap between financial aid and the total cost of tuition. How can I support the Faculty & Staff Campaign? You can support the campaign with an annual gift to The Muhlenberg Fund.
Every amount counts - even small gifts can generate remarkable returns. If you contribute one hour per month of your salary to TMF, you will support worthy students who benefit from your mentorship, and their families who struggle to keep their sons and daughters in the classroom.You can set up a payroll deduction, make a gift online or drop off your gift to anyone in the Office of Advancement. To make a payroll deduction or a one-time gift, please print this form Faculty & Staff Payroll Deduction and return it to Mark Mazer, senior director of advancement services.

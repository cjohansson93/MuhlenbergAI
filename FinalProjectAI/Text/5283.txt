basketball playoff schedules set


Both Muhlenberg basketball teams will host Centennial Conference playoff games this week.

The men (15-10) are the fourth seed in the CC playoffs and will welcome Haverford for a first-round game on Wednesday at 7:30. 


McKeon Repeats as Player of the Week





Sophomore Kelly McKeon of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was named Centennial Conference player of the week for the second week in a row.

McKeon averaged 16.0 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists in leading the Mules to a pair of wins and the first 18-0 CC season in league history. She had a triple-double 
with 13 points, 11 boards and 10 assists at Ursinus, helping Muhlenberg rally late for a 68-65 win.

The winner travels to top-seeded Franklin & Marshall for a semifinal contest on Saturday. The other semifinal matches Gettysburg against McDaniel.

This will be the Mules’ 12th playoff appearance in the 16 years of the CC’s existence but their first home playoff game since 2002. Haverford (12-12) is in the playoffs for the fourth time. Muhlenberg swept the Fords in the regular season, winning 73-41 at home early in the season and 53-50 at Haverford three weeks ago.

Men’s schedule
• Wednesday, February 25
   (5) Haverford at (4) Muhlenberg, 7:30
• Saturday, February 28 (at Franklin & Marshall)
   (3) Gettysburg vs. (2) McDaniel, 1:00
   Haverford or Muhlenberg vs. (1) Franklin & Marshall, 3:00
• Sunday, March 1 (at Franklin & Marshall)
   championship game, 3:00

The Muhlenberg women (22-3) ran away with the CC, becoming the first team in league history to finish a perfect 18-0 and winning the regular-season title by seven games over five teams that tied for second.

The Mules will host the semifinals and final on Saturday and Sunday as they try to defend their 2008 title and become the first CC school to win five championships. Up first for Muhlenberg is the winner of Wednesday’s first-round game between Dickinson and McDaniel. Franklin & Marshall and Johns Hopkins will clash in the other semifinal.

The Mules have qualified for the CC postseason every year but one. Since the CC moved to one division in 2004, the top seed has won the championship only once – Muhlenberg in 2006.

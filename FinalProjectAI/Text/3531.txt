rice namedathlete of the week


Muhlenberg junior Peter Rice was named Centennial Conference men’s indoor track and field co-athlete of the week.

Rice broke two school records at the Lafayette Rider Games. His time of 49.66 (50.16 converted) is the fastest 400 time in the Centennial Conference this 
season, and he also set the school record in the 200 with a time of 22.40. 

Running the anchor leg in the 4x400 relay, Rice chased down a Moravian runner from behind to give the Mules a fourth-place finish with a time (3:27.57) that ranks fourth on the
programs all-time performance list.

Earlier this season, Rice ran the 55 meters in 6.59 seconds, the second-fastest in Muhlenberg history and just one one-hundredth of a second off the top time
in the CC this year.

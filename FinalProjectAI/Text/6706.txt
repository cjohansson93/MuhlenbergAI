Men's Basketball Comes Up Short in Puerto Rican Opener
 Tuesday, December 18, 2012 - page 2







					 




Albright gained control midway through the second half and held on for a 78-76 win in the first of two games for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team at the Puerto Rico
Christmas Tournament.



The two teams were within six points of each other for the entire first half, which ended with the score tied at 31. It remained close in the early part of the second
half until the Lions (9-1) began to pull away, taking their biggest lead at 58-49 around the eight-minute mark.

The Mules (6-4) got within three, at 63-60, with three minutes to play and missed a three-pointer on their one possession with a chance to tie the game. Albright came back with
a basket and hit enough free throws down the stretch to withstand three three-pointers from freshman Alec Stavetski (including one at the final buzzer) in the last 35 seconds.
 
Stavetski finished with a career-high 25 points, going 5-for-7 from three-point range. Sophomore Malique Killing added 21.

Junior Brandon Bovino (left) scored a career-high 16 points, and junior Kevin Hargrove (right) 
contributed six points, eight rebounds and five blocked shots, moving into second place on the program’s all-time list with 143 career swats.

Muhlenberg has won five of its last seven games, with both losses coming by two points. The Mules lost to Albright by a much larger margin when the teams scrimmaged
in the preseason.

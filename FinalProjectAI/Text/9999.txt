Background B.A., University of Michigan Ph.D., University of North Carolina
I have been teaching at Muhlenberg since 1996. I regularly teach courses in French language, literature, and culture as well as a course on Francophone Cultures of Africa and the Caribbean. My research focuses primarily on women in medieval literature.  My book Women and Laughter in Medieval Comic Literature was published by the University of Michigan Press in 2003.  My most recent book, The Representation of Women's Emotions in Medieval and Early Modern Culture, is a collection of essays by noted scholars in medieval studies that I edited.
My other interests pertaining to medieval literature include crusade poetry and the French domestic farce of the late Middle Ages. Although I primarily work on French material, since my degree is in Comparative Literature, I also work on German, British, and Arabic texts. I occasionally teach a course on medieval literature in the English department as well as independant studies of comparative topics.
From 1989-1991, I was a Peace Corps volunteer teaching English at the FacultÃ© des Lettres at UniversitÃ© Hassan II in Morocco. I taught English composition and conversation, American Civilization, British Civilization, and African Literature. As a result of this experience, I've had a long-standing interest in African cultures and literatures and teach a course on French writers of immigrant origin.  I am also faculty liaison with the Peace Corps. I help students prepare their applications, speak to concerned parents, and help organize information sessions on campus.
I am also interested in environmental issues. I am a member of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE), and have taught a French topics course on environmental issues in France and the francophone world.  My recent scholarly work on the Guadeloupean author, Simone Schwarz-Bart was recently published as an article in Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment.

In addition to my teaching and research, I am also director of the Faculty Center for Teaching, which provides ongoing support and programming for Muhlenberg faculty.

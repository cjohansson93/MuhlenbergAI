Playing a lineup of mostly freshmen, the Mules defeated Penn State Berks, 6-3, at home for their second win of the season. Muhlenberg showed its excellent depth, sweeping third through sixth singles with their normal No. 6 player moved up to No. 2.

One of the freshmen, Michael Robbins, won at both singles and doubles. He teamed with junior Matt Kral for a 9-8 (7-3) win at second doubles that gave Muhlenberg a 2-1 lead entering singles competition. Kral also won his singles match at No. 3.

Muhlenberg could not carry over any momentum from Friday’s stirring ninth-inning rally and was swept by St. John Fisher, 4-3 and 22-5.

The Mules (6-11-1) jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning of the first game on three singles and a wild pitch. After the Cardinals took a 4-2 lead, Muhlenberg got on run back in the third, but manged only two baserunners the rest of the game.

Senior Matthew Ordog pitched four innings of scoreless relief, striking out four, and junior Eric Pomroy went 2-for-3.

The Mules fell into a big hole early in the second game. Senior Chris Costa had two hits and drove in two runs.

The 2008 season marked the first time the Muhlenberg and Gettysburg softball teams both finished under .500 in the Centennial Conference in the same year. Trying to return to the form that produced four CC championships in five years from 1999 to 2003, the two programs are both at .500 after splitting their CC-opening doubleheader.

The Mules won the first game, 3-2, and the Bullets came back to take the nightcap, 8-1. 



Freshman Maggie Scarpelli bunts Ferrigno over to third in the sixth inning of the first game.



Muhlenberg (6-8) finished a stretch of three doubleheaders in four days with a 3-3 record.

Sophomore Ashley Brewer pitched a three-hitter and allowed only one earned run in the opening game for the third win of the season. She also drove in the go-ahead run, doubling in freshman Shelby Smith with two out in the fifth to break a 1-1 tie.

The Mules used two more doubles, by seniors RiRi Ferrigno and Samantha Crist, to add an insurance run in the sixth. 

Gettysburg (15-3) scored an unearned run in the top of the seventh, but Brewer fanned the last two batters to end the game.

Freshman Brittany Blohm knocked in Muhlenberg’s first run with a two-out single in the second, preventing a repeat of last year’s double shutout loss to the Bullets.

Gettysburg scored three runs in the top of the first and never looked back in taking the second game. Sophomore Jess Kasza scored the Mules’ lone run after hitting her second double of the day.

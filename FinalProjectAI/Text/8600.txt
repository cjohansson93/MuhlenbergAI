Learning Goals
A course of study in philosophy at Muhlenberg College serves three main learning goals: development of skills in argument identification, analysis and evaluation; cultivation of intellectually sound habits of mind; and acquisition of foundational philosophical knowledge required for serious engagement in the discipline.
These three learning goals encompass the following:

Skills:

the ability to read philosophical and non-philosophical texts with comprehension of complex and/or hidden argumentation
the ability to identify an argumentâs major, supporting and assumed premises
the ability to analyze evidence and evaluate arguments for cogency
the ability to construct rationally persuasive arguments for and against various philosophical positions and theoretical perspectives
to compose and articulate philosophical questions raised by texts, arguments, and theories
to imaginatively engage texts and to creatively construct interpretations
to make connections among ideas, concepts, and problems across different fields of philosophy
to write effective prose appropriate to the discipline

Habits Of Mind:

to approach the study of philosophy with intellectual humility and patience and accept and engage complexity
to be willing to examine oneâs own views as well as competing views and to subject all beliefs or claims to honest and fair scrutiny
to be willing to explore all views with care and patience so as to avoid oversimplification
to recognize the significance of moral and ethical reasoning and bring informed moral reflection to bear on issues of both personal life and social/civic engagement

Knowledge:

to identify and demonstrate familiarity with major Western philosophers and philosophical movements
to comprehend the distinctive contribution of Asian philosophies and demonstrate understanding of one or more of those philosophies
to discern, identify, and discuss central philosophical issues and problems, both those of enduring importance and those specific to a period or movement
to understand how the philosophical underpinnings of other disciplines shape inquiry in those disciplines
to demonstrate familiarity with major ethical perspectives and concerns and apply major perspectives to concrete problems of various kinds, and/or identify major socio-political perspectives and demonstrate comprehension of those perspectives in relation to concrete issues or problems

	 Monday, March 11, 2013  09:58 AM

Her talk, “Corporate Social Responsibility,” is free and open to the public. 
Nash is a member of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility where she works on corporate responsibility, shareholder advocacy, including environmental issues and sustainability, human rights and community development.  Her efforts also currently focus on human trafficking and responsible approaches to fracking.  Her work has been featured in The New York Times and on National Public Radio.
Market Values is co-directed by Sue Curry Jansen, professor of media and communications, Mohsin Hashim, associate professor of political science, and Marcia Morgan, assistant professor of philosophy.  This year-long program examines historical and contemporary questions about markets and accompanying moral issues they raise.  The goal of the Center for Ethics’ programming is to engage the community in intensive and reflective thinking about individual and collective values.

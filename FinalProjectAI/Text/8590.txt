There is a wide range of opportunities for students to conduct field and laboratory-based research projects.  Many students work with Muhlenberg faculty, and some have travelled to external sites within the U.S. and around the world.  Research findings are often published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at scientific conferences.  A small sampling of the types of projects that are currently underway or have been undertaken recently is listed belowâand you are encouraged to reach out to any faculty member affiliated with the program for more information.

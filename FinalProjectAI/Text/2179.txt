Theatre & DanceNews & NotesTheatre & Dance Anti-Racism Action Plan 















Note (8/17/20): The process documented on this page was begun under the leadership of former Department Chair Troy Dwyer. Professor Dwyer announced July 1 that he was stepping down from the chair position.
The work begun this spring has continued under the leadership of the Department Culture & Practices Committee, a group of faculty members that includes Megan Flynn, Rebecca Lustig, Matt Moore, and Leticia Robles-Moreno. This committee is in communication with a group of students and alumni, and is working to chart the path forward.
This committee can be reached by email at tdantiracism@muhlenberg.edu.
The faculty and staff of the Theatre & Dance Department remains fully committed to the Action Plan published June 17.
In the video commentary recorded by Professor Dwyer and linked below, there are some inaccuracies, which the committee is working to publicly correct. However, in the interest of transparency and documentation, these videos will remain public at this time. None of the inaccuracies materially affect the commitments made in the Departmental Action Plan.
We will make additional updates to this page in the next several weeks about recent activity, and will continue to update going forward.

As mandated by our students and alumni, the Theatre & Dance Department is undertaking ongoing work to ensure the establishment of anti-racism and the confrontation of anti-Blackness as fundamental departmental values and practices.
Documents and videos pursuant to these efforts will be posted on this public webpage.

We are obligated to inform you that all faculty and staff of the department are mandatory reporters under Title IX. This means that we are required to report incidents of identity-based discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and criminal conduct to the Director of Equity and Title IX, Jennifer Storm. Here's what Mandatory Reporting means. Counselors, health providers, and clergy are not Mandatory Reporters.

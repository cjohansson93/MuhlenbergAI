washington invaded by packs of mules





Senior Mike Gehrmann assisted on the first goal. He has nine points this season after recording only one total in his first three years.


Here’s a new flash: The long bus trip back from Washington doesn’t seem so long when Muhlenberg finishes on the positive side of the ledger.

Muhlenberg’s mastery of the road continued, and its mastery of Washington resumed, with a 4-0 win.

The Mules (8-3, 4-1) are now 5-0 away from Varsity Field this season, outscoring their opponents 19-0. And after losing to the Shoremen for the first time ever last year, Muhlenberg looked to start a new streak with its most decisive win in the 23-game history of the series.

Seniors Adison Weseloh and Samuel Hayden scored goals in the first half to stake the Mules to a 2-0 lead. Hayden’s was his first of the season. 

Muhlenberg doubled its margin with goals very early and very late in the second half: Sophomore Cody Antonini put in a shot off a great long pass from Hayden
just 26 seconds after the break, and freshman Danny Way closed out the scoring with only 33 seconds on the clock. (corrected 10/14) With 10 goals, Antonini is the first Mule sophomore to reach double digits since 2003.

After a pair of losses, Muhlenberg got back on the winning track and kept its perfect record against Washington intact.

record against the Shorewomen to 12-0. The game was the middle one of a five-game run for Muhlenberg that includes nationally ranked Centennial Conference foes Dickinson, Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins.

The Mules (6-5, 3-1) took a 1-0 lead 7:07 into the second half on an own goal when senior Kimberly Hacker sent a corner kick crossing in front of the goal. A Washington defender accidentally played the ball into the goal while trying to clear it. Muhlenberg made it 2-0 when freshman Maggie Neary sent a pass ahead on a break to sophomore Meghan O’Grady, who scored at 63:34. O’Grady has now scored a point in five of the last six games; for Neary, it was her first career point.

The third set was tied at 21-all before a solo block by sophomore Jackie Price and three straight kills by senior Phylicia Lee ended the match.

Lee finished with a match-high 14 kills and added 13 digs. Freshman Bryn Baker also had a double-double (29 assists, 13 digs), and sophomore Davi Gordon (9 kills, 10 digs) just missed. 

Muhlenberg has won 15 straight matches against the Shorewomen.

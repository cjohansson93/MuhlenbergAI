Both Muhlenberg golf teams competed in the Ursinus Invitational. The men finished third out of 14 teams, while the women were sixth out of seven complete teams.

Leading the men was freshman David Barkley, who tied for fifth with a career-low 77. Barkley (left), whose previous best round was 86, became the fourth
Mule to finish in the top five in a tournament this year.

Seniors Chris DiMaio and Christopher Lucarelli each shot a 79, giving Muhlenberg three golfers in the 70s for the first time
this year. The Mules’ team score of 318 was four strokes better than their previous season low.

career-best 89 to place eighth out of 41 golfers.

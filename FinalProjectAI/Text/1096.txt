COVID Alert Level Change



A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg community

Thursday, November 12, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
I am thankful for the way all of us have come together to support one another and ensure the health and safety of all members of our community. As I have said before, your ability to adjust and adapt to the COVID policies in place this semester have contributed to our success in making it to this point.
Even so, we must remain vigilant as cases nationally are on the rise. Over the past two weeks we have seen reports about the increase in COVID-19 cases locally in Lehigh County and at other institutions in the Lehigh Valley. The update to our own dashboard today reflects two new positive cases along with 22 students in quarantine. Due to concern over the potential for spread within our community and out of an abundance of caution we are raising our campus alert to Level 2: Moderate.
This new alert level includes the following changes:
ON-CAMPUS Students:

Academic classes can continue with in-person instruction at this time. However, faculty may move classes online at their discretion. Students can choose to attend any in-person class remotely;
The Residence Hall Phased Approach To Visitor Policy will move back to Phase 1;

Traditional halls and suites: Permitted to have one visitor from âfamily unitâ in your room.
Apartments/houses: Permitted to have one visitor from âfamily unitâ in your apartment/house.
No public lounge and/or kitchen use.


Beginning on Friday, November 13, we strongly encourage students to utilize take-out dining. In addition, if you are eating with others anywhere on campus, please only remove your mask long enough to eat and replace it immediately;
Most, if not all, in-person events will move to virtual formats;
The occupancy of the gym may be reduced at any time;
All sport practices and group fitness classes are suspended;
Students living on-campus should NOT leave campus even locally, unless it is for an essential purpose; and
For now, Seegers Union and academic spaces are available for students to gather with others to socialize, play games or watch a movie.

OFF-CAMPUS Students:
We are amending our COVID Social Gathering Policy immediatelyâthere should be NO student gatherings of any size off campus. You are strongly encouraged to stay home in your apartment with your roommates, but you should not socialize with other groups and you should not host any visitors.
REMOTE Students:

Please do not travel to campus at this time unless you have explicit permission from the College.
You are also strongly encouraged not to travel to Allentown to visit with off-campus students.

The College will continue to monitor the situation on campus and locally. If we receive more information or test results that continue to show an upward trend, we will consider adjusting to a Level 3: High Alert which would include moving to fully remote dining and instruction.
Given the need to do everything we can to prevent community spread, students should expect that the COVID Policy will be strictly enforced and any enrolled students in violation of this Policy can expect to be sent home immediately in addition to other conduct sanctions.
STUDENT TESTING:
Additional Surveillance Testing
The College has contracted with a private COVID testing company. They will be on campus tomorrow, November 13, from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m., to complete a large number of surveillance tests. Last week, we had a number of students who did not respond to the initial testing request. Staff spent hours tracking down students who did not register for their required test. Students selected for this weekâs surveillance testing will be notified this afternoon by email. Students selected for surveillance testing are required to participate as stated in our COVID-19 policy. Non-compliance will result in conduct action.
Exit Testing
If you were not selected for surveillance testing this week and live on campus you are eligible to receive a test prior to returning home during tomorrowâs testing period or on Monday as previously communicated. We strongly encourage you to complete a test tomorrow rather than waiting until Monday when testing will be more limited. Results from tests completed on Friday will also be available sooner than testing completed on Monday. Please see the information below to receive a test tomorrow.
Important Information for Testing on Friday (November 13):

Walk-in testing available from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. No appointment necessary.
Testing will be located in the tent on the football stadium track. Enter through the Life Sports Center main entrance.
This is a saliva based test. Do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum 30 minutes prior to arrival.
Bring your mobile device so results can be shared with you when available.

Next week is the last week of classes before the extended Thanksgiving break. We encourage everyone living on campus to increase the precautions they take to limit potential exposure. Please make sure to wear your mask properly at all times, maintain social distance and ensure that you are washing your hands throughout the day. Any on-campus students choosing to leave early should notify their RA and turn in their key upon departure.
I want to remind you that when we have positive cases in our community anyone on campus deemed a close contact will be notified individually. The College will provide testing and quarantine housing to close contacts as needed.
Thank you all for your cooperation. Weâre all in this together. Please stay safe and healthy.

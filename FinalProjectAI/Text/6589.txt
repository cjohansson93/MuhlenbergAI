Field Hockey Falls to Washington
 Saturday, October 6, 2012 - page 4







					 




The Muhlenberg field hockey team had its three-game winning streak snapped with a 2-0 home loss to Washington.

The Shorewomen, who qualified for the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last two years, broke a scoreless tie by scoring a goal with 10:21 left in the first half.

The Mules (7-4, 3-3) had several good chances to tie midway through the second half but could not find the back of the net, and Washington (6-5, 3-2) scored a deflating insurance goal with 10:30 to play in the game.

Senior Kristen Dornenburg made 11 saves in goal. Junior Ashley DeAngelis recorded a pair of defensive saves, pushing her season total to seven – good for fourth on the Muhlenberg all-time list – and sophomore Ray Gallagher (left) also had a defensive save.

Despite the loss, the Mules are still in the middle of a crowded pack of teams contending for playoff berths. After first-place Franklin & Marshall (6-0), Muhlenberg’s opponent next Saturday, seven teams, including the Mules, have three wins apiece and are all separated by a half-game in the standings.

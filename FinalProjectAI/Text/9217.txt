Shelley Drozd
Shelley Drozd served as the interim senior writer at Muhlenberg College in the spring of 2018.
Creating narratives that engage, inform, persuade and motivate is writer Shelley Drozdâs stock-in-trade. She brings veteran experience in print and online publishing, corporate communications and higher education to her interim writing position at Muhlenberg. 
Shelleyâs health reporting career started at Rodale, Inc., where she held staff positions at Menâs Health and Prevention magazines. She also regularly contributed to Menâs Fitness and Runnerâs World magazines and most recently was as a founding writer and editor of Webshrink.com.
After a stint as a copy editor and reporter for the Morning Call Chronicles, Shelley spent two years writing for the corporate communications department of vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur. 
Higher education came calling by way of Lehigh University, where Shelley worked for six years as the first communications specialist for the department of civil and environmental engineering. These days she creates marketing communications for Jewish Student Life at Lehigh and has also written for Lafayette College.
Shelley graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in religious studies from Moravian College and has done graduate work at Lehigh. Whenâs sheâs not professionally communicating, sheâs a hack musician, fitness buff, foodie, perennial student and community caretaker.

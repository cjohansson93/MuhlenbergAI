Mens Soccer Moves into Second Place



It did not take the Muhlenberg mens soccer team long to get started at McDaniel. 

Junior Josh Luginbuhl scored in the 11th minute to give the Mules an early advantage. Then with less than 13 minutes remaining in regulation, the junior midfielder added another goal off an assist from Mike Williams as Muhlenberg (8-0-5, 3-0-3) picked up an important 2-0 road victory over the Green Terror (5-9, 2-4).

It was the second multi-goal game in the span of a week for Luginbuhl (below), to bring his season total to five goals. He also became the third Mule to reach double digits in points on the season.





Muhlenberg outshot McDaniel 17-7 and also picked up its eighth shutout in 13 games this season.

The win, coupled with Swarthmores draw at Franklin & Marshall, allows Muhlenberg to control its own destiny in the conference race. The Mules currently sit in second place, behind the Garnet, with the two teams scheduled to meet in a week-and-a-half in Allentown.  

Muhlenberg added to its program-best 13-game unbeaten streak to start a season, and also remains one of only seven unbeaten teams remaining in Division III, after Emory and Williams both lost this weekend.

McDaniel came in to its home football game against Muhlenberg leading the Centennial Conference in scoring defense and fresh off its second shutout of the season. But the best defense in this game belonged to the visiting team.

The Mules allowed only 143 total yards and seven first downs in winning their 





Senior Jon Liberty caught a 41-yard pass to set up the game's first touchdown.



fifth straight game, 29-0. The shutout was their third in the last two seasons and their first ever in Westminster.

With the win, Muhlenberg (5-1, 5-0) kept pace with Ursinus as the lone teams undefeated in Centennial Conference play. Every other teams in the league has at least two losses.

The Green Terror (4-2, 3-2) had its only scoring chance on the final drive of the first half, driving to the Mule 28 before missing a field goal on the last play of the half. Other than that drive, McDaniel took only two snaps in Muhlenberg territory the entire game.

The Mules held McDaniel to 22 rushing yards on 20 carries and allowed only two third-down conversion in 17 attempts.

Senior Patrick McDonough led the defense with 9 tackles, including a 
sack, and junior Matthew Siedt added 7, including a half-sack.

The special teams and offense also did their part. Senior Michael Katz tied a career 


high with three field goals, all from 40 yards or longer, accounting for the first nine points of the game. The first one, from 40 yards, came after NCAA-leading kick returner Chase Nadell brought back the opening kick 40 yards, and the second, from 46 yards, was a career best.

Katz' third field goal, a 44-yarder, capped Muhlenberg's longest drive 




Junior Kenneth Cobb had one-and-a-half of the Mules' four sacks.



of the game, an 11-play, 55-yard march that took 7:12 off the clock. Muhlenberg enjoyed a huge advantage of more than 12 minutes in time of possession.

On the drive after Katz' third field goal, McDaniel fumbled while lined up 
to punt, and senior Mark Accomando recovered for his third turnover gained in as many weeks. Five plays later, sophomore Terrence Dandridge scored from 3 yards out to make it 16-0.

Dandridge finished with a career-high 140 yards on 29 carries for his fourth consecutive 100-yard game.

McDaniel fumbled the opening kickoff of the second half, and junior Matt Musick fell on the ball at the Terror 27. Again the offense turned the turnover into points, needing only three Dandridge runs, the last from 16 yards out, to score another touchdown.

After a fourth-down stop near midfield, the Mules put the game away with under five minutes to play on a 50-yard touchdown pass from sophomore Dan Deighan to senior Bobby Bushong.

Muhlenberg has outscored its last two opponents 67-3, and only a missed extra point kept the Mules from reaching 30 points for the fourth consecutive game.

Men’s Tennis


The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team rolled past hosting DeSales, 9-0, securing its first victory on the season. 

The Mules, who hadn’t had an official match since Feb. 24, won all six singles matches in straight sets, limiting the Bulldogs to only 12 total games. 

Sophomores Robbie Goldwein, Jonathan Farber and Matt Kral defeated their opponents in a commanding fashion, each allowing only one game. Farber
added an 8-0 win at No. 2 doubles, where Muhlenberg recorded three more victories.

Baseball


Battling to the last out took on new meaning for the Muhlenberg baseball team, which played a doubleheader consisting of two nine-inning games for the first time. The Mules
(6-6) came up short in the bottom of the ninth both teams, however, and were swept by St. John Fisher, 10-7 and 9-6.

In the first game, Muhlenberg entered its final turn at bat down by four runs. A single, walk and error brought the tying run to the plate, but the Cardinals (8-2) turned
to their bullpen and got the final two outs.

St. John Fisher blasted two three-run homers to take an early lead in the nightcap and led by six runs heading into the bottom of the ninth. A two-run double by
junior Edward Risener brought the Mules to within three, but that was as close as they got.

Risener drove in five runs in the two games. Junior Eric Hammond went 3-for-5 with two doubles in Game 2, and junior John Kalis registered five hits on the day.

Having one or two consistent goal scorers always helps a team, but having a bunch of them means you have a squad that has set its sight on accomplishing something huge. 
Fortunately for the Muhlenberg’s women’s lacrosse team, it can’t complain of a lack of scoring potential. 

The Mules’ balanced attack amassed 13 first-half goals en route to a 17-10 home win against the 



Sophomore Alyssa Bascelli forced four turnovers and contributed to the offense with a goal and an assist.



Widener Pride. Now, winner of three straight games, Muhlenberg has won 20 consecutive games against non-conference opposition. 

The Mules have scored at least 17 goals in their 
past three encounters and average 15.8 goals per game since the start of the 2008 campaign. Last season, the squad produced 12.4 goals per game.

“We have an excellent all-around attack,” said senior Marissa Capuano, who finished with one goal and one assist. “This season we have a number of highly skilled shooters and passers. Previous years we’ve had only a few scoring threats, while now multiple players get points for us in every game.”

The Mules scored the first 12 goals in the game, while shutting out their opponents for almost the entire first half. Eight Muhlenberg players recorded their names on the 
scoresheet. 

The Pride finally got onto the scoreboard 28 minutes into the game, before senior Taylor Armstrong put in her fourth on the day to make the score 13-1 for Muhlenberg going into halftime. 

The visitors came out strong in the second half and outscored 9-4 the Mules, who had lost their focus.

Armstrong scored a team-high four goals and added an assist, while junior Sara Hiller and sophomore Amanda McGovern each tallied a hat trick. 
Freshman Danielle Rosen and junior Megan Wilson scored two goals apiece.

Both Muhlenberg goalkeepers (freshmen Allisyn Vachon and Dana Tedesco) saw playing time in the victory, each recording remarkable saves in the second half and making eight stops apiece. 

Next the Mules will pay a visit to Dickinson to resume Centennial Conference action, looking for their first league triumph this season.

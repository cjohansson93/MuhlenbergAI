Basketball Teams Swept at Home by Hopkins; Wrestling Drops Two
 Saturday, January 26, 2013







					 


Playing at home did not prove to be an advantage for the Muhlenberg basketball teams, who both struggled to make shots and lost to Johns Hopkins.




Junior James Albano converted a putback with 6:06 left in the first half to make the score 21-20.



In the men’s game, Johns Hopkins pulled away in the second half for a 63-59 win, spoiling a record day for Kevin Hargrove.

The junior center blocked six shots to become the program’s all-time leader with 171 in his career. He also recorded a double-double with 17 points and 14 rebounds.

Muhlenberg (11-8, 7-5) rallied from an eight-point halftime deficit to tie the score at 39 seven minutes into the second half. The Blue Jays (12-7, 8-4) broke the tie with a three-pointer, however, and held on to the lead the rest of the game.

Despite having their three-game winning streak snapped, the Mules remained two games out of first place in the Centennial Conference, thanks to a loss by Franklin & Marshall, and with a two-game lead for the fifth and final playoff spot.

Junior Brandon Bovino also had a double-double for Muhlenberg with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore Malique Killing scored 11 points, all in the second half, and tied a career high with six assists.

In the women’s game, Muhlenberg made only six second-half field goals and lost, 52-44.

The Mules trailed 30-29 early in the second half before going for almost eight minutes without making a shot to fall behind 45-31. They then went on an 11-0 run to cut the deficit to three with just over two minutes left, but the Blue Jays (10-9, 8-6) scored the next four points and held on for the win.

Junior Leeann Lanza led Muhlenberg (11-7, 8-5) with 10 points and six rebounds, and sophomore Hannah Rush tied her career high of seven assists with no turnovers.

The loss left Muhlenberg in a tie for third place in the CC, a game ahead of Hopkins and Washington.

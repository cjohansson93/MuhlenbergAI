Applicants for the Organizational Leadership (MOL) Masterâs Degree will typically have two or more years work experience.  We also recommend that entering students have had some college or working experience related to leadership, such as in human resources, planning, management, public administration, and/or organizational psychology.  College seniors or recent graduates may meet this requirement through appropriate professional experiences, such as internships, summer work, externships, athletics, creative activities, and projects.
Applicants to the Applied Analytics for Organizations (MAA) Master's Degree will have successfully completed statistics and calculus courses within the last five years. For those who do not meet this requirement or who desire to refresh their knowledge and skills, we offer a half-unit pre-course covering mathematical concepts integral to a studentâs success in the masterâs program. College seniors may enroll in the Masters of Applied Analytics program in conjunction with their Bachelorâs degree with certain graduate courses fulfilling their undergraduate and graduate requirements.

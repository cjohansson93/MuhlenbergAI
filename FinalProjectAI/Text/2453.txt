Dotzman is the 10th different Mule to earn a spot on the NSCAA elite squad, the first since 2010. The honor caps a long list of postseason honors for the midfielder, who also was Academic All-America third team, Academic All-District first team, All-Mid-Atlantic Region first team, All-Centennial Conference first team and CC player of the year.
Dotzman is the first player in the storied history of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer program to earn All-America and Academic All-America honors in the same year. He is only the seventh different athlete in College history to achieve that impressive double.
Dotzman led the Mules with 30 points on 13 goals and four assists in 2014. He was at his best down the stretch, notching eight goals and an assist in the final 10 games of the season, including three postseason goals.
Among his most memorable tallies were a game-tying penalty kick with 6:11 left in a 4-3 comeback win against Haverford, a diving header for the winning goal with 5:54 remaining against Dickinson and the lone goal in the second half of a CC semifinal game vs. Dickinson. Dotzman also netted two goals in the NCAA first-round game against Baruch and converted a penalty kick to help Muhlenberg advance past Catholic in a second-round shootout.
A three-year starter, Dotzman finished his career with a total of 53 points on 22 goals and nine assists.
Muhlenberg was ranked 14th in the final NSCAA poll after reaching the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time. The Mules won their sixth CC championship and finished with a record of 15-2-3, falling in the NCAAs to eventual national champion Tufts. Click here for the complete All-America team.

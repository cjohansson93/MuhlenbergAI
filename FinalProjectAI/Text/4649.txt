Home run, triple play not enough for baseball, softball 


Junior Joseph DiCecilia had another big day at the plate for the Muhlenberg baseball team, but an eighth-inning rally lifted Swarthmore to a 6-5 victory in each team’s Centennial Conference opener.

DiCecilia homered and drove in at least four runs for the third time in four games, finishing 2-for-2 with a walk.

The first baseman put the Mules (6-8, 10-2) up 1-0 in the first on a sacrifice fly, and sophomore Jesse Nusbaum singled in another run to make it 2-0.




Van Waalwijk nearly scored to make it 2-0 in the first inning of Game 2 but was narrowly thrown out at the plate.




The Garnet (8-6, 1-0) plated one in the bottom half of the inning, but DiCecilia widened the lead with his fourth big fly of the season in the third. With two runners in scoring position, he belted one over the fence in left-centerfield, putting the Mules ahead 5-1.

Senior Phil Cresta allowed just one run to cross the plate over the next five innings, including retiring Swarthmore 1-2-3 in the seventh. But the Garnet bats awoke in the eighth, recording four singles and a hit-by-pitch before the first out was recorded. Swarthmore would go on to score four runs in the inning to take a 6-5 lead.

The Mules managed two base runners on a pair of walks in the ninth but couldn’t muster the tying run.

Nusbaum was 2-for-2 at the plate and stole a base, and freshman Joseph Vila went 2-for-3 with a base on balls.

The softball team dropped both ends of a doubleheader to New Jersey, 9-0 and 9-2.

In the first game the Mules turned a rare triple play. With runners on first and third in the fifth, the batter lined out to junior Jess Kasza at shortstop. Kasza’s throw to third was not in time, but sophomore Brittany Blohm was able to nab the runner at first. Senior Jenna Van Waalwijk then threw home to catch the runner from third and complete the feat.

The Mules (4-9) jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the second game and trailed only 3-1 heading into the sixth. But the Lions (10-2) scored six runs in the top of the inning to put the game out of reach.

Sophomore Shelby Smith went 2-for-3 with an RBI in Game 2, and Kasza went 1-for-2 in both contests.

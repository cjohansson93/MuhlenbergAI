Education
M.F.A., Costume Design, University of California, San DiegoB.A.,Theater, University of California, Santa Cruz
Teaching Interests
I teach studio classes that encourage students to explore their own theatre-making processes and discover how design elements can support and contribute to storytelling in performance. I place emphases on students honing their skills in interpreting visual information and learning to communicate effectively as collaborators.
In design classes, students learn to interpret a performance text and develop a design from concept to presentation. Classes include instruction on drawing, painting and other rendering techniques.  
I also teach about the history of costume and fashion, focusing on the use of historical research for performance design and the interpretation of period-inspired garments in performance.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsAs a costume designer my work has appeared across the U.S. and was featured in the United States Exhibit at the 2015 Prague Quadrennial. I especially enjoy designing new and company devised works, such as the ongoing project Flight with the New York based Anonymous Ensemble. I also regularly design musicals, including âBring It Onâ for the Muhlenberg Summer Music Theatre, and plays by Shakespeare including âThe Two Gentlemen of Verona,â directed by Eric Tucker at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival. Other favorite projects include âThe Happiness Lectureâ created by Bill Irwin at the Philadelphia Theatre Company, the page-to-stage version of âI Am My Own Wifeâ starring Jefferson Mays and directed by playwright Doug Wright at the La Jolla Playhouse, the original workshop production of Rajiv Josephâs âBengal Tigerâ at the Baghdad Zoo at SUNY Purchase. I was the assistant costume designer on the North American productions of âBilly Elliot the Musicalâ (Broadway and national tours) and assistant/associate designer on the Hal Prince directed productions âLoveMusikâ on Broadway, âParadise Foundâ in London, and âCandideâ at the New York City Opera.

Quarantine Information: July 20, 2020



A Message from Vice President of Student Affairs Allison Gulati

Monday, July 20, 2020

 
Dear students and families,
 
On Friday, July 17, students received the most current quarantine information for Muhlenberg.  This included information related to pre-arrivals and specific details for those coming from hot spot locations across the country. You can view this entire message here.  This email reflects changes from what was described as the likely quarantine plan communicated during the Residential Life webinar on Tuesday, July 14.
Some students and families have had questions about the reason for the shift in plans regarding pre-arrival quarantine. The information below provides our rationale for this change. 
Pre-Arrival Quarantine Context: 
Since Tuesday's webinar, we have been in direct consultation with our local infectious disease specialists, the Allentown Health Bureau and the Pennsylvania Department of Education who were able to provide colleges with additional information. The recommendation for residents and visitors to Pennsylvania is to quarantine if returning or arriving from any location identified as a hotspot. At this time this is a recommendation and not a requirement. We have learned that for a number of reasons, the recommendation as it stands from the state right now, will not be accurate in limiting symptomatic individuals from coming to campus. For example, students in PA who are going to the Jersey shore are significantly more likely to have been in a hot spot locale, rather than someone who lives in a rural part of California or Texas where their community has not seen significant activity at all throughout the pandemic. 
Also, in the case of pre-arrivals, none of these individuals presumably have been told by their local health officials that they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive. In talking with our infectious disease specialists, the likelihood of them then testing positive on arrival after quarantine and direct travel while taking proper precautions is very low.  With testing supplies across the country limited, it is important for us to be good stewards of these resources even though we have access to them in our Health Center and through our local provider. As a college and in consultation with our team of experts, our assessment is that any student is just as likely to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease as another and this is much more connected to high risk activity they have participated in (going to bars and indoor restaurants, socializing with others without a mask or without social distancing, etc) than the state from which they are from.  
That said, we are counting on our students to show integrity and to comply with our request to self-quarantine before arriving. The digital symptom checker students are required to complete (via the Muhlenberg app) will report your responses to the health center and it is our hope that all students will answer these questions accurately and honestly.  While it is possible that a student may not be forthright in completing it, that is a reality we will have to live with throughout the academic year. To supplement the symptom checker, we will be doing temperature checks during move-in. In addition, for all students coming from a hotspot state, the Health Center is going to be doing a 1-1 interview with the student two days before they travel to campus to ask some more detailed questions to ensure compliance and to provide clear guidance about precautionary measures a student should take while traveling to campus.  
With the additional guidance provided by the health experts we have consulted with in recent days, we believe it was more prudent to adjust our quarantine plan to address the items noted above. 
 
Ultimately, COVID-19 is a community issue. Every single member of the college community has ownership in keeping our campus safe. Addressing only students from hotspot states during pre-arrival is far too narrow a focus. All individuals who are exposed are susceptible to infection, not just students from certain areas. Our revised plan reflects that. All students should be practicing preventive measures - face coverings, physical distancing, hand hygiene, disinfection. To address a select few, who represent a very small fraction of our student body, in our pre-arrival planning seems counterintuitive to the culture we are trying to build - that we are all individually and collectively accountable for the well-being of our campus community.
 
Student Accountability is Key:
 
Finally, in speaking of the culture we are trying to build, before you finalize your fall plans, I want to make it abundantly clear how serious the College will take our collective commitment to health and safety. We have received a couple of concerns from neighbors off-campus this past weekend and email concerns from students who are worried about their peers' compliance with College policies. Moreover, I was quite encouraged during our recent webinar when 97% of you who attended stated that you supported the need for these policies, were willing to comply with them, and were also willing to help your peers do the same.
 
It is important for all students to understand that living on campus and accessing campus classrooms, buildings, dining facilities and other resources is a privilege.  This is a privilege that can also be revoked under our Student Code of Conduct.  Any student who repeatedly or blatantly violates our COVID-related health and safety policies will be held accountable.  
 


For on-campus students, this includes sanctions up to the immediate removal from campus housing; and/or immediate removal of access to campus including in-person classes, dining, entrance to buildings and in-person use of College services.


For off-campus students, this includes sanctions up to the immediate removal of access to campus including in-person classes, dining, entrance to buildings and in-person use of College services.


Off-campus social gatherings held by Muhlenberg College students will be limited under the COVID-related health and safety policies to 20 or fewer guests.  Violation of these policies will constitute a violation of both our Student Code of Conduct and Disruptive Conduct Policy.  In addition, there will be policies related to mask-wearing, social distancing, visitors on campus and in residence halls, etc. that must be adhered to.


To the extent permitted under FERPA, all violations of the COVID-related health and safety policies will be sent to the address on file for the studentâs parent(s) and/or guardian(s).


 
Knowing all of this information, I want you to be able to make the best possible decision for you and your family. Please know that the College fully supports your decision to participate in remote learning if campus-opening plans feel uncomfortable to you.  We have invested significantly in further training for our faculty this summer and they are prepared to support you in the remote learning format.  In addition, if you remain at home, you will still have access to participate online in various clubs/organizations and social activities through the College. Please consider your health, comfort level with our plans, willingness to adhere to our policies on campus, and any other personal factors as you make your final decisions.  Muhlenberg will be here to support you in either format.
Thank you,

Message to Study Abroad Students from the Office of Global Education
Friday, January 24, 2020

Dear Study Abroad Students,
As you may know, there is a new Coronavirus circulating globally that appears to have originated in Wuhan, China sometime in December.  This virus is known to cause pneumonia-like illness with varying degrees of severity from mild cold symptoms to severe respiratory distress that can be fatal.  It appears that the virus is transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, so it is highly contagious.  The incubation period is five days between exposure and the onset of symptoms.   
Currently, the CDC and the World Health Organization are monitoring the situation.  Please monitor your local news outlets and follow recommendations from your program.  If you feel ill, it is imperative that you get a medical evaluation.   If you believe you have been around anyone or if you have been anywhere with exposure to the virus, you should seek medical care immediately and keep yourself away from others.  
More questions can be directed to Brynnmarie Dorsey, our Executive Director of Health and Counseling at dorsey@muhlenberg.edu.
Sincerely,
Donna M. Kish-Goodling, Ph.D.Professor - EconomicsDean - Global Education

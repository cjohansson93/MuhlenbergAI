Basketball Teams Swept at Gettysburg

Killing scored eight points on three consecutive possessions late in the first half. He also recorded three assists and three steals.



In a game that appeared to be a win when the final buzzer in regulation sounded, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team suffered a tough 84-78 overtime loss at Gettysburg.

The Mules, who lost their third straight, took a 74-72 lead on a runner by sophomore Malique Killing with 9.9 seconds left in regulation. The Bullets came down and attempted a three, which was missed, but a Gettysburg player got the offensive rebound, and Muhlenberg was called for a foul at the horn in the scramble under the basket.

The referees put five-tenths of a second back on the clock. The Bullets (8-7, 4-4) made both free throws, then scored the first seven points of overtime as the Mules went cold from the field.

Muhlenberg led by 10 points midway through the second half, but Gettysburg tied the score with a 15-5 run, and neither team led by more than three points in the tense final seven minutes.

Junior Kevin Hargrove scored a career-high 24 points, and Killing finished with 27. Freshman Alec Stavetski added 13 off the bench.

What shaped up as a defensive struggle in the women’s game was more of a struggle for Muhlenberg than it was for Gettysburg.

In a matchup of the top two teams in Division III in field-goal percentage defense, the Bullets shot 38.5 percent in defeating the Mules, 62-49, giving the teams a split of their season series for the fourth year in a row.




Zabrecky had a team-high four assists. She leads the Mules in scoring, rebounding and steals and is tied for second in assists.



Muhlenberg entered the game first in the country in field-goal defense, allowing opponents to shoot only 27.8 percent, while Gettysburg was second at 28.6 percent. The Mules’ four losses have come in the only games in which their opponent scored more than 48 points.

The loss dropped Muhlenberg (9-4, 6-2) out of a tie for first place in the Centennial Conference, although it is still in sole possession of second (a game behind Swarthmore) due to Haverford’s loss to Johns Hopkins. 

Senior Alita Zabrecky (12 points, 11 rebounds) recorded her fifth double-double of the season for the Mules, who shot a season-worst 28.6 percent from the field.

Muhlenberg fell behind 13-6 in the first five minutes and spent the rest of the game trying to catch up. After the Bullets (9-5, 6-3) opened up a 27-17 lead with six minutes left in the half, the Mules went on an 8-0 run to close the gap to two. Gettysburg scored the last two points of the half, however, to take a four-point lead into the locker room.

The Bullets went up by 10 again early in the second half and the Mules scored the next five points to cut the margin in half, but they never got closer than four points.

Junior Erin Laney and sophomore Nicole Pepe scored nine points apiece, and junior Katy Mitton pulled down a career-high eight rebounds.

Muhlenberg College Looks Back on a Successful 2014 MuleMentum Campaign


In a display of unity from the entire Muhlenberg community on November 12, 2014, the College attracted more than 1600 donors to a 24-hour blitz of giving known as MuleMentum, easily surpassing their goal of 1,500 donors with nearly two hours to spare.

"It was terrific to see how the Muhlenberg community pulled together," said Rebekkah Brown, Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations. "...It really does take the entire Muhlenberg community to keep moving the College forward."
The MuleMentum team asked 1500 alumni, faculty, staff, students and friends of Muhlenberg College to show their support in continuing to provide the Muhlenberg experience for students now and in the future. As the day unfolded, a carnival-like atmosphere surrounding MuleMentum took hold in a least one location.

Last year more than 1,400 people made gifts to the inaugural MuleMentum campaign, resoundingly surpassing the goal of 910 donors.
Muhlenberg College values all of the alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends that made MuleMentum possible; your support, day-after-day and year-after-year, enables us to continue our mission to provide a welcome environment for the developing independent critical thinkers who drive our future.
"Thank you so much for your support of MuleMentum and we'll look forward to next year," Brown said in appreciation of donors.

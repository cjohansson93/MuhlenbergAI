Lectures

âMusical Theater and Nazi-Era Stories: Understanding an Uncomfortable Pairingâ, Dr. Judah M. Cohen, Lou & Sybil Mervis Professor of Jewish Culture and Associate Professor of Musicology, Indiana University

Recounting the Nazi period presents to many a nearly sacred boundary of artistic taste, especially when it comes to musical theater. In this talk, Dr. Cohen approaches musical theater as an artistic language that has engaged deeply with the politics of Nazism since the 1930s. His accounts of these works help forge a deeper portrait of the form and its artists, while addressing the postwar shift into moral tension with institutions devoted to Holocaust memory.

âOn Different Grounds: Jewish and Christian Understandings of the Middle Eastâ, Dr. Amy-Jill Levine, University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies, Vanderbilt University


âJesus the Jewish Storyteller: Of Pearls and Prodigalsâ, Dr. Amy-Jill Levine, University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies, Vanderbilt University


âWhat Are Jews For?: The History of the Idea of Jewish Chosennessâ, Professor Adam Sutcliffe, Kings College London

The biblical âelection of Israelâ â the setting apart of the Jews by God, as recipients of divine protection, and bearers of special holiness â has been the focus of fascination and repeated reappraisal by both Jews and non-Jews throughout the modern era. This theological concept lies at the heart of a broader question: what is the particular purpose of Jews in the world? In this lecture Professor Sutcliffe will trace the history of the âJewish Purpose Questionâ from its biblical and medieval roots, through key early modern thinkers such as Spinoza and Moses Mendelssohn, and up to the twenty-first century.

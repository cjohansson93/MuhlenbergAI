Liaison Program of Trexler Library: Role Description
Library Liaisons: Departmental Liaisons List 
Library Liaisons: Interdisciplinary Program Liaisons List

Liaison Program of Trexler Library: Role Description
The Liaison Program of Trexler Library promotes communication among Trexler Library, academic departments, and interdisciplinary programs.
Librarian Liaisons (LL)
The librarian liaison (LL) serves as a key contact to an academic department or an interdisciplinary program. It is the LL's responsibility to help departmental liaisons (DLs) and interdisciplinary program liaisons (IPLs) manage their collection development responsibilities by recommending titles for purchase, managing purchase requests, systematically reviewing the collection, and making recommendations for deselection. It is also the LLâs responsibility to share updates with DLs and IPLs regarding, for example, specialized tools, new resources, procedures, and changes in the library.
When reviewing requests submitted to the library, the LL will follow the collection development policy and guidelines before sending the request for purchase. In the event that there is a concern, the LL, in consultation with the Head of Collection Resource Management, will work with the DL or IPL to ascertain needs and determine what other appropriate options are available.
Departmental Liaisons (DL)
Each academic department is represented by a faculty member who serves as departmental liaison (DL). The DL is the libraryâs main contact for the department regarding collection development and request concerns, general library issues and communications, collection management projects, and questions that may arise regarding any library issues. It is the responsibility of the DL to manage the department's allocation fund and to serve as the departmentâs internal coordinator regarding the selection of items to be purchased with the fund. The DL is asked to share relevant information with colleagues regarding library resources, services, updates, etc. The DL is asked to attend approximately one to two library liaison meetings per academic year.
In order to best fulfill acquisitions responsibilities, it is important to consider these issues when requesting items and reviewing your colleaguesâ requests:

A departmental allocation supports the disciplinary programs wholly associated with that department. For example, all requests for sociology and anthropology resources should be submitted to the sociology and anthropology DL in order to be funded by the departmental allocation. The allocation formula credits all SOC and ATH courses to the sociology and anthropology departmental allocation.
Departmental requests must be approved by the DL and the LL before the order is placed.
Fifty percent (50%) of departmental allocation must be spent on purchasing books. The remaining 50% may be used on any one-time purchases (e.g., books/ebooks, DVDs, data sets, etc.).
Liaisons are expected to review and approve acquisitions requests in accordance with the Collection Development Policy and Guidelines.
Faculty who wish to recommend subscriptions should communicate with their LL about their interests. See below for more information.

Interdisciplinary Program Liaisons (IPL)
Each interdisciplinary program is represented by a faculty member who serves as interdisciplinary program liaison (IPL). The IPL is the libraryâs main contact for the program regarding collection development and request concerns, general library issues and communications, collection management projects, and questions that may arise regarding any library issues. It is the responsibility of the IPL to serve as the internal program coordinator regarding the selection of items to be purchased. The IPL is asked to share relevant information with colleagues regarding library resources, services, updates, etc. The IPL is asked to attend approximately one to two library liaison meetings per academic year.
In order to best fulfill acquisitions responsibilities, it is important to consider these issues when requesting items and reviewing your colleaguesâ requests:

The allocation for interdisciplinary programs supports courses assigned interdisciplinary program course prefixes, as well as core materials for each program. For example, all requests for womenâs and gender studies resources should be submitted to the womenâs and gender studies IPL in order to be funded by the interdisciplinary programs allocation. The allocation formula credits all WST courses to the interdisciplinary programs allocation.
Interdisciplinary program requests must be approved by the IPL and the LL before the order is placed.
Liaisons are expected to review and approve acquisitions requests in accordance with the Collection Development Policy and Guidelines.
Faculty who wish to recommend subscriptions should communicate with their LL about their interests. See below for more information.

Other Information for All Liaisons
Additional information about funds and requesting procedures for all types of library resources, including subscriptions, is available in the Guide to Requesting Library Materials or contact your librarian liaison.

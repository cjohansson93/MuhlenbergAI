Field Hockey Comes Back Twice to Win in Overtime
 Saturday, September 15, 2012 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg field hockey team had plenty of reasons to celebrate with homemade cupcakes and s’mores bars on the bus ride home from McDaniel. Junior Dayna Hovern and sophomore Ray Gallagher had birthdays last week, and the team had just overcome a two-goal deficit to defeat McDaniel in overtime in its first Centennial Conference game of the season.

Hovern scored the winning goal for the Mules 9:24 into a fast-paced overtime filled with penalty corners and fast breaks down the turf. The Green Terror and the Mules both had several close calls near the cage in overtime.




Porrinis timely defensive save was the fifth of her career; last year she preserved a win against Dickinson with a last-second save.




Senior Kristen Dornenberg had three saves and sophomore Heather Porrini had a defensive save in overtime to keep the Mules (4-1) in the game.

“McDaniel is really strong. I was tired, my team was tired and I’m sure McDaniel was tired,” laughed Hovern. “It could have been anyone’s game.”

McDaniel (3-3) jumped ahead quickly, scoring two goals in the first 8:36 of the game.

“When we got down by two in the beginning I tried to motivate the team. We play well when we don’t get our heads down,” said Hovern.

Muhlenberg was able to erase McDaniel’s lead in a little more than 12 minutes.




The Mules celebrate the first of their game-tying goals.




First, Hovern scored off a pass from sophomore Kayleigh Thies on a penalty corner. Then Thies controlled a loose ball in the circle after a penalty corner and fired a shot past the goalie.

“At halftime, Coach congratulated us on staying positive and coming from behind to tie it up. But she also encouraged us to win,” said Hovern.

Winning would require another comeback. McDaniel scored an own goal 12:10 into the second half. But with 15:14 left in regulation, sophomore Lauren Jordan netted her second goal of the season to tie the score back up at 3-3.

Hovern’s second goal of the game gave Muhlenberg its third straight win in overtime. The win was the first in which the Mules came back from a two-goal deficit since a 1998 contest against FDU-Madison. That was also the last time the team came back twice in the same game to win.

“There were two turning points in the game,” said Hovern. “The first was when we tied it up. This gave us the mentality to keep scoring. The second was going into overtime because we are really well-conditioned so we knew we could keep playing.”

The Mules were physically as well as mentally prepared for the overtime thanks to the confidence gained from other wins, especially the one against No. 9 Montclair State. They will try to take that confidence into an important CC week against Haverford and Johns Hopkins.

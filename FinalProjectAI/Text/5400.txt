three seconds for wrestlers at fall brawl



The Muhlenberg wrestling team came home from its second tournament of the season with three second-place finishes. Seniors Rob Kein (149) and Matt Horn (197)
and freshman John Sternlicht (165) all fell in the finals at the Ursinus Fall Brawl.

No team scores were kept at the tournament, which included two teams ranked in the top 15 in Division III: No. 14 New Jersey and No. 15 Williams.

Sternlicht (right), in his first career tournament at the college level, pinned his first three opponents. In the championship bout, he lost a one-point decision
to a New Jersey opponent who earned All-America status by finishing eighth at the NCAA Championships last year and is currently ranked sixth in Division III.

Kein also held his own against stiff competition in the final. He reached the title bout with a technical fall (his third of the season), first-period pin and a pair of
two-point decisions. Kein’s opponent, a returning NCAA qualifier currently ranked seventh in Division III, won in overtime.

Horn won two matches before his loss in the final. Senior Justin Fitch was the other Mule to earn a place, coming in fourth at 174.

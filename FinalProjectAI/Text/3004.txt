football falls in cc opener



Women’s Soccer Beaten by Late Goal


Regionally ranked Scranton scored off a direct kick with 6:34 remaining to break a 1-1 tie and went on to defeat Muhlenberg, 2-1.

All the scoring came in the later stages of the game. The Royals (8-1) opened the scoring with 22:23 left, but almost exactly six minutes
later the Mules (4-3) tied the score when junior Valerie Patriarca tipped in the rebound of sophomore Meghan O’Grady’s
saved shot.

Patriarca also hit the crossbar with the game still scoreless in the second half, and the Mules were robbed by diving saves twice.


Muhlenberg was attempting to beat the Royals for the second year after never having defeated them previously. All three of the Mules’ losses
are to regionally ranked teams.

On a rainy day at Gettysburg, the Muhlenberg football team struggled on offense and dropped its Centennial Conference opener, 20-3.

The Bullets (1-3, 1-1) came in allowing more than 500 yards per game 



Senior Frank Emmett tackles Ricky Manigat for an 8-yard loss back to the 10-yard line in the fourth quarter. The Bullets kicked a field goal for
the final points of the game on the next play.




but held the Mules (1-2, 0-1) to 220 total yards. Muhlenberg committed 
four turnovers, two in the red zone, and was held to three points for the first time in a regular-season game since a 10-3 loss to Gettysburg on 
the same field in 2005.

Despite allowing 270 yards in the first 30 minutes, the 
Muhlenberg defense held the high-scoring Bullets to three first-half points. Gettysburg drove inside the Muhlenberg 5-yard line on its first
two possessions, but the defense stiffened around the goal line and forced two field goal attempts, one of which failed.

The Mules came back after the made field goal with their lone scoring drive, using a 24-yard completion from freshman Justin Kreamer to
senior Phil Cresta to move into Bullet territory. Junior Michael Katz kicked a career-best 45-yard field goal with 1:35 left in
the first quarter to tie the score. Katz’ previous best, 42 yards, also came in difficult rainy conditions at home vs. Franklin & Marshall
last year.

Gettysburg finally scored the first touchdown of the game midway through the third quarter and added 10 points in the fourth.

Cresta caught a career-high nine passes for 131 yards. Freshman Terrence Dandridge rushed 23 times for 93 yards.

Junior Patrick McDonough led the defense with 10 tackles.

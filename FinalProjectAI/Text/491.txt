Filters and dolphin sounds 

November 29 - February 2, 2019


 
Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to present Filters and dolphin sounds, a solo exhibition by Claudia Bitran.
In this show the artist deepens her investigation into the semiotics of personal marketing and online sharing culture. She will present four new works: a series of backlit doodle drawings in light boxes representing instagram filters; paintings on panel depicting body fragments of young female influencers; a stop motion animation based on viral videos of animals and babies falling in slow motion; and interactive sound pieces that will submerge viewers into a mashup of fragments of today's pop hits. Collectively, the works identify and break down filters that are commonly used in online sharing dynamics. Bitran proposes a deeper look at the signs and mechanics of online sharing culture, bringing to light the real intentions behind certain types of posts and the figures of speech that connect them, as well as proposing some fictitious new ones.

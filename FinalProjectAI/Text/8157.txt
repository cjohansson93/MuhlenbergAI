The Business Administration major is a 12-course sequence that begins with an introductory âBusiness & Societyâ course and extends to culminating courses in strategy, leadership and marketing management.  Along the way, majors study economics, accounting, statistics, marketing, management and finance.
Every major pursues a concentration in Management & Organization Studies, Marketing, Arts Administration, International Business or a self-designed concentration. Some Business concentrations include select courses in other College departments.
The updated description of the Business Administration major is in the College catalog.

women’s basketball pulls away from fords





McKeon is averaging 11.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists through four games.



For the Haverford women’s basketball team to get a chilly reception at Memorial Hall is nothing new. After all, the Fords are 0-23 all-time at Muhlenberg’s home court.

But for visit No. 23, Haverford also got a Chili reception, as freshman Alexandra Chili sparked the Mules to a 68-55 victory with her second-half passing and shooting.

The win extended Muhlenberg’s winning streak against Haverford to 33 games and gave the 21st-ranked Mules a 4-0 start for the fifth time in six seasons.

Muhlenberg missed its first eight shots and had trouble shaking the Fords (0-3). The first half featured seven lead changes and ended with the Mules up 28-25.

The margin was only one, 41-40, with 11 minutes left before Chili started heating up. Muhlenberg outscored Haverford, 23-10, over the next seven minutes. Of the nine field goals in the run, Chili was involved in eight, making four (all three-pointers) and assisting on another four.

Chili, the reigning Centennial Conference player of the week, finished with 15 points (tying the school record for freshmen with five three-pointers for the second straight game) and six assists.

Senior Lauren Boyle also scored 15 points, and sophomore Kelly McKeon notched her second double-double of the season with 11 points and 10 rebounds.

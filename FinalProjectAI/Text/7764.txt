Football Sacks Gettysburg for 500th Win
 Saturday, October 18, 2014 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg football team took Gettysburg’s three-game winning streak and put it in a sack – or 10 of them, to be precise.


The Mules bottled up an offense that had averaged 36.3 points and 501.3 yards in its previous three games, recording 10 sacks in rolling to a 47-6 win.

Sophomore Nick Palladino threw for 230 yards and three touchdowns, freshman Max Cepeda rushed for 103 and a pair of scores, senior Khiry Hughes scored his first career touchdown and senior Connor Winter kicked a career-long 49-yard field goal as Muhlenberg posted the 500th win in program history.

Sophomore Mike Luby recorded 2½ of the 10 sacks, and senior Ian Gimbar had one to tie the school record of 22½ in a career. Senior Gene Blanco (right) was another one of the nine Mules to get in on a sack.

Gettysburg (3-3, 3-2) was held to 49 total yards in the first half, and until a backup quarterback ran for 42 yards in the fourth quarter, the Bullets’ leading rusher was their punter, who gained 28 yards on two fake punts.

Cepeda’s 100-yard game, the fourth of his six-game career, came against a defense that was ranked 18th in Division III in rushing defense and had held three straight teams under 100 yards. Cepeda had 104 yards at halftime, helping the Mules (5-1, 4-1) to a 24-0 lead.

Muhlenberg scored its first touchdown with 3:40 left in the first when Cepeda carried in from 5 yards out, capping a 9-play, 40-yard drive. On the Mules’ next drive, Cepeda ran the ball on six of the eight plays, including the final yard for a score.


The defense again gave the offense a short field after a three-and-out on the next possession for Gettysburg, and Muhlenberg capitalized to extend its lead to 21-0 midway through the second quarter. Palladino hit sophomore Ryan Delaney for a 12-yard gain on third-and-11 and was about to be sacked two plays later when he flipped the ball at the last minute to Delaney, who carried it in for a 15-yard touchdown.

The Bullets took possession at their own 21 with 11.6 seconds left in the half, and instead of running out the clock, they tried a screen pass. But senior defensive end Greg DeLade intercepted it, setting up Winter’s 34-yard field goal as the half expired.

Palladino threw touchdown passes of 33 yards to junior Nick Lamb and 35 yards to senior Cody Geyer (left) in the third quarter to make it 37-0. Geyer, who finished with seven catches for 92 yards, caught a pass over the middle and outraced Gettysburg defenders to the end zone for his first touchdown of the season.

Muhlenberg fumbled the ball away two plays after the lone Gettysburg score, but on the next play from scrimmage Hughes picked off a pass at midfield and returned it for a touchdown, the Mules’ third on an interception return in the last four games.

Winter’s 49-yard field goal, the longest by a Mule since 2002, cleared the uprights with several yards to spare.

Palladino finished 20-of-34 and extended his streak of passes without an interception this year to 195.

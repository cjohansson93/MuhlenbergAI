It took only four batters for the Muhlenberg baseball team to score its first run at Ursinus. But the second run never came.

The Mules (14-9, 2-2) had runners on base in every inning and in scoring position in seven of the nine innings but hit into four double plays and lost, 4-1.

Sophomore Nick Plinio (left) drove in Muhlenberg’s run with a double and finished the game 3-for-4.

Mission Statement of Judicial Affairs


The Office of Judicial Affairs at Muhlenberg College emphasizes education by focusing on the growth and development of the individual student, encouraging self-discipline and fostering a sense of respect for the rights of others.
Purpose of the Student Conduct System
The policies and procedures specified in this Social Code ("Code") are designed to affirm, protect, and model the following educational purposes:
Muhlenberg College aims to develop independent critical thinkers who are intellectually agile, characterized by a zest for reasoned and civil debate, committed to understanding the diversity of the human experience, able to express ideas with clarity and grace, committed to life-long learning, equipped with ethical and civic values, and prepared for lives of leadership and service.
Community of Responsibility
To be responsible is to be morally and legally accountable.  Muhlenberg College students are members of a community of responsibility.  They have a duty to foster and preserve a collegiate environment that encourages the maximum development of themselves, their fellow students, and the larger society.  They adhere to the highest standards of good citizenship.  They conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and due regard for the rights and property of others.
Student Code of Conduct â

 31.0 Advisors
31.1  The accused student shall have the right to select as an Advisor an approved member of the College faculty or management staff to assist him/her in matters involving alleged violations of the Code. In addition, the accused student and alleged victim shall have the right to select an Advisor of choice in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy.
31.2  Upon being referred to a Disciplinary Conference, the accused will receive a list of trained student Advisors who can help the accused prepare for his/her Disciplinary Conference.
31.3  Each year the Vice President of Human Resources will appoint members of the College Administration to serve as Advisors for matters referred to a Hearing Board. They are trained to be familiar with the Code. The accused may also select another (non-trained) member of the College community to serve as an Advisor. Accused students (and in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, the alleged victim) will be asked to acknowledge that he/she did receive the name of a trained Advisor and the importance of utilizing a trained Advisor. However, no accused student (and in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, the alleged victim) will be required to select or consult such advisors.
31.4  The following list of College professionals are excluded from acting as an Advisor: Presidentâs Staff, Provost, and Deans and Vice Presidents of the College.
31.5  The accused student (and in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender- Based Misconduct Policy, the alleged victim), may be accompanied by an attorney; however, the attorney may not address the Hearing Board, or take part in the hearing process. The student must provide written notification to the Student Conduct Officer of the intent to have an attorney present at least 24 hours prior to the Hearing. Except when criminal charges are pending against the accused student, the College reserves the right to refuse to grant permission for the appearance of an attorney on behalf of the accused student (or in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, the alleged victim) at the hearing.
31.6  An Advisor may accompany and consult with the accused student (and in the case of alleged violations of the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, the alleged victim); however, the Advisor may not address the Disciplinary Conference Committee or Hearing Board, or take part in the hearing process.

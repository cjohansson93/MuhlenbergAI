Not everyone would be enthusiastic when describing their summer research as âa lot of sitting by yourself in your room or the library and reading for hours on end until you forget what your own name is.â But Kristen Corless â20, an English and theatre double major, clearly enjoys her work. It helps that sheâs reading Emily Dickinson, a poet Corless got into as a first-year student at Muhlenberg. She was taking a class with Professor of English Grant Scott, who showed the students a photocopy of Dickinsonâs poem âHow the Old Mountain Drips with Sunsetâ in the authorâs handwriting.
âI just took one look and it was like love at first sight,â Corless says. âI bought my own copy of her poems and started devouring them.â
Since then, Corless has amassed a solid amount of background knowledge in Dickinsonâs life and work through classes and her own independent reading. That proved critical when Corless approached Professor of English Jill Stephen to advise her through a Dickinson-related senior honors thesis.
âTo do an adequately informed thesis on Dickinson requires not only surveying relevant scholarship (and there is a lot available!) but reading all of the nearly 1,800 poems, preferably more than once,â Stephen says. âThis is a tall order, one that I have hesitated to think could be reasonably managed by a busy undergraduate. But Kristenâs dedication to the project and the amount of reading she had already done before embarking on her summer research persuaded me that she could and would succeed.â
Stephen suggested that Corless get a jump start on her thesis by participating in Muhlenbergâs summer research program. Their discussions helped Corless narrow down a topicâhow Dickinson uses nature to explore immortality and deathâas well as a starting point. Corless has been spending her days categorizing Dickinsonâs poems and pulling quotes from primary and secondary sources that might be useful when the thesis-writing begins in earnest. Corless meets with Stephen weekly, sometimes for hours at a time, to give updates and discuss next steps.
âShe is so excited to talk about Emily Dickinson,â Corless says of Stephen, who shares her passion for the poet, âand she takes this on as an adventure.â

"Arctic Quest" author Chad Kister will visit Muhlenberg College on Monday, January 31, 2005 in the Lithgow Science Auditorium, Trumbower Science Building, at 4:15 p.m. This event is free and open to the public. 
Kister will present slides from his trip to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and talk about the current status of the fight over oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge on Monday afternoon at 4:15, January 31st at Muhlenberg College, as well as letting people know what can be done from Pennsylvania to help protect the Arctic Refuge.
In 1991, Kister traveled 700 miles through the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, rafting the rivers of the coastal plain, photographing the landscape and the wildlife and nearly dying of hypothermia after capsizing his raft in the Kekiktuk River. Encountering grizzlies, Prudhoe Bay oil workers, eating Arctic char caught in the rivers, Kister was privileged to see sights that the rest of us have to read about.
Kister traveled to the Arctic Refuge in order to see the threatened land for himself and to understand more fully why it should be protected. The 100-mile stretch of arctic coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only fragment of the United States' total 1,100-mile arctic coastline not already open to oil and gas development. Now, oil industry officials are pushing for access to this fragile heartland of this last complete eco-system in North America.

three named to all-region teamin basketball



  


For the second year in a row, three Muhlenberg basketball players were named all-region by D3hoops.com. And it was the same three players in 2011 as it was in 2010.

Juniors Spencer Liddic and Alexandra Chili earned first-team honors, and senior Kelly McKeon was voted to the third team.

Liddic (top left) moved up to the first team from the third team. A unanimous All-Centennial Conference selection for the second consecutive year, Liddic led the CC in scoring (20.4 points per game) and rebounding (9.8 rebounds per game). Only the fifth player in team history to average 20 points per game for a season, Liddic broke a 40-year-old school record by scoring 509 points.

Liddic scored in double figures in all but one game and led the CC with 13 double-doubles. Also a first-team Academic All-American, he will enter his senior season 15th on the Mules' all-time scoring list with 1,221 career points.

Chili (top center) also moved up, from the second team to the first team. She not only led the CC in scoring (18.8 points per game) and three-pointers (2.76 per game), but she also became the CC's career leader in three-pointers with a year to go. Chili also was third on the CC-champion Mules in assists and blocked shots, fourth in steals and fifth in rebounding.

Chili, who hit the shot of the year with a last-second three-pointer to beat Williams in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, broke her own school record with 546 points and tied the school record for field goals in a season (181). She will enter her senior season third on the program's all-time scoring list with 1,497 career points, fewer than 200 away from the school record.

McKeon (top right), the 2010 Mid-Atlantic Region player of the year, started slowly after missing the first eight games of the season with injury but made up for it with a strong finish, averaging 18.6 points and 10.6 rebounds in five postseason games. She wound up leading Muhlenberg in assists (79) and rebounding (7.7 per game) and was second in scoring (10.6 points per game).

On the Mules' all-time lists, McKeon finished first in assists (453), third in steals (201), fourth in free throws (324) and fifth in points (1,237) and rebounds (763).

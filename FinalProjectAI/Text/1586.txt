On Thursday April 7, 2005 at 8 p.m., the Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics will sponsor the Free Culture Tour, a multimedia presentation, by Brooklyn artist and Duke graduate Colin Mutchler (Class of 1999), that highlights issues regarding copyright, creativity, and the Internet. This event, held in the Red Door Café in the College’s Seegers Union, is free and open to the public.
Mutchler mixes music, images, and spoken word, drawing from his personal experience as web producer for Listen Up! youth media network to demonstrate the complex and entertaining cross section between cultural property and freedom.
As a musician and artist, Mutchler has been writing and performing since 1995. Living in Brooklyn, NY since 1999, he has performed at venues such as Halcyon, the Bowery Poetry Club and the Sidewalk Cafe. As a solo musician, he has been described as uniquely able to address broad political topics while still keeping the music intimate, personal and organic. Mutchler is also a social entrepreneur committed to using media and the Internet to inspire cultures and economies to take action toward sustainability, responsibility, and freedom. His work as web producer for Listen Up!, and previous work for NYC Public Schools have enabled him to continue working toward his vision of a vibrant media democracy.
The Free Culture Tour is the third program in the College’s semester-long series, Ethics in the Information Age.

The Cuba MILA course, Bodies & Identities in Contemporary Cuba, allows students to intensively study Contemporary Cuba during the fall semester, and experience it first-hand during travel to Cuba in January. Developed by Dr. Cathy Marie Ouellette (History) and Dr. Janine Chi (Sociology), this course introduces students to multiple ways of thinking about issues in Cuba today and asks students to continue to develop their own worldviews and perspectives as they sort through this. By the end of the semester, students will formulate their own research questions and develop their own research methodologies utilizing multiple frameworks, sources, and interjecting multiple ideologies.

Muhlenberg College has been named one of the best 100 collegiate entrepreneurship programs in the United States in the April 2005 issue of Entrepreneur magazine. Muhlenberg appears in the first tier of the list of the top 50 regionally recognized academic programs in the country. The College was also listed in the magazine’s rankings last year.
The two objectives of the entrepreneurial studies program at Muhlenberg are to prepare graduates in the concepts of innovation and self-reliance appropriate for a variety of life and career pursuits and to support entrepreneurs in the greater Muhlenberg community. Through a combination of course instruction, hands-on internships, small business simulations, independent research and lectures from guest speakers, the program strives to equip students with the well-founded confidence necessary to assume the appropriate and calculated risks fundamental to meaningful life and career choices.
The program emphasizes the importance of innovative and critical thinking, careful planning and adaptation and flexibility that together represent the philosophy and technique of entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneur’s 3 rd annual evaluation of the best entrepreneurship programs at U.S. colleges and universities is the most credible and comprehensive analysis of its kind. The rankings were performed by TechKnowledge Point Corp. in Santa Barbara, California. Founded in 2001 by David Newton, TechKnowledge Point Corp. is the world’s first and only 24/7 online research and referral exchange for entrepreneurship and enterprise development.

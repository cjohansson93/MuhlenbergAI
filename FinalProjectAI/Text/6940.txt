Softball Clinches Top Seed in Centennial Conference Playoffs

The road to the Centennial Conference softball championship will pass through Allentown.




Jones has pitched 22 consecutive complete games dating back to last year.



Muhlenberg clinched first place and the right to host the CC playoffs for the first time with a doubleheader sweep of
Ursinus on Senior Day. The Mules (24-7-1, 12-2) won the first game in a pitchers’ duel, 2-0, then flexed their offensive
muscles in the nightcap, winning 11-3 in five innings. They finish up CC play at Franklin & Marshall next Saturday before
hosting the league tournament the weekend of May 4 and 5.




Picked fifth in the CC preseason poll, Muhlenberg has won the championship the last two times it has been in the playoffs.

Sophomore Kelsey Jones pitched a three-hitter for her second shutout of the season in the opener. She walked
none and struck out seven in improving to 8-0 with a 1.24 ERA in CC games.




Giovinazzo's RBI double was her first career extra-base hit.



The Bears (11-18, 6-7) advanced two runners to third base, but neither scored thanks to the heads-up fielding of
freshman Alexis Giovinazzo at third. She ended the top of the fifth by making a diving stop of a would-be
RBI single to keep the game scoreless. Then in the sixth, with a runner on third and one out, Giovinazzo faked a throw to first
on a ground ball and threw behind the runner to junior shortstop Colleen O’Donnell, who applied the tag to retire the runner.

Muhlenberg finally broke through in the bottom of the sixth. Junior Erica Wenzel led off with a triple over
the head of the right fielder and scored on a single by freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski. O’Donnell drove in an insurance run with a double off the third-base bag.

The Mules wasted no time putting up runs in the second game, scoring six runs in the first innings. Eight straight batters reached
via walk or single, with Dzieciolowski, freshman Taylor Trifiolis and seniors Devon Barber and
Elizabeth Sullivan delivering RBI singles. Barber’s came on a bunt single, her second of the
doubleheader, with the bases loaded.

Giovinazzo delivered an RBI double to deep center in a three-run third, and Dzieciolowski ended the game with a single up the 
middle in the fifth. Despite the Mules’ outstanding record, it was only the second time this season that they won a game on the eight-run rule.

Junior Kelly Kline went 3-for-4 with two RBI in the second game, and Sullivan, who was honored along with
fellow seniors Barber, Jessica Costa and Angie Sisco prior to the games, went 2-for-3.

Sophomore Heather Porrini, making her first CC start of the season, pitched a six-hitter to earn the win.

Centennial Conference Announcement



A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg community

Thursday, December 10, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
Earlier this afternoon the Centennial Conference released information regarding fall and winter competition that included the following decision:
âWith the health and safety of its student-athletes, campus communities and the general public of paramount importance, the Centennial Conference Presidents Council has decided to cancel Conference competition and championships for all fall and winter sports during the 2020-21 academic year.
Sports impacted by this decision include menâs and womenâs cross country, field hockey, football, menâs and womenâs soccer, volleyball, menâs and womenâs basketball, menâs and womenâs swimming, menâs and womenâs indoor track and field and wrestling.â
The Conference decisions about competition have involved very thoughtful and passionate discussion regarding the importance of athletics to the college experience on the campuses of all member institutions. We all deeply value our athletes, the opportunities for athletic competition and the sense of community and pride they generate. I encourage you to read the full story regarding the Centennial Conference decision on our athletics website. Our athletics and dean of students offices will hold a virtual town hall on Monday, December 14 to provide additional information and answer questions. Please look for details in a follow-up email from the athletics department. A decision about spring sports competitions will likely happen sometime in January.
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringPresident

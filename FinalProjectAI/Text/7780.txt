Field Hockey Falls to F&M in Semifinal
 Saturday, November 8, 2014 - page 4







					 




The Muhlenberg field hockey team was eliminated from the Centennial Conference playoffs with a 1-0 loss
to Franklin & Marshall in a semifinal game at Ursinus.

The Diplomats (17-1), ranked fifth in Division III, advance to play sixth-ranked Ursinus in the
championship. This will be the third time in the last four years that those two teams meet for the
title.

The Mules (12-5) await word on a postseason berth, either an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament or an
ECAC Tournament invitation. They entered the week ranked fifth in the South Region by the NCAA.

Just like in the first meeting this year, Muhlenberg fell into a 1-0 hole when F&M scored off a penalty
corner in the first 15 minutes of the game. Three weeks ago the Mules tied it up before halftime
in an eventual 2-1 loss, but this time they could not find the equalizer.

Seniors Allie Califano and Heather Porrini were solid in
the back in holding the Diplomats, who came in averaging more than four goals a game, to the one tally.

softball walks off with win vs. hounds


How did freshman Angie Sisco react when she found out she would be making her first career start for the Muhlenberg softball team against nationally ranked Moravian?

I just relaxed and treated it like any other game, she said. I tried not to get 




Sisco is the first Muhlenberg softball pitcher to toss an extra-inning shutout in her first career start. There have been only five
extra-inning shutout wins in program history.





too nervous, because that leads to mental errors. I didnt want to make it anything special.

Oh, but it was special. Sisco pitched a four-hit shutout in her first career start as the Mules defeated the 22nd-ranked Greyhounds, 1-0, on a walkoff single by junior Jess Kasza in the bottom of the eighth. Moravian came back to win the nightcap, 5-1.

The win in the first game snapped a 12-game losing streak by Muhlenberg to its local rival, dating back to the second game of the 2002 doubleheader.

Sisco did not strike out or walk a batter, letting her fielders - mostly the infielders - do the work. Of Moravians 24 outs, all but two (a caught stealing and a popout) were on the ground, and two of the Greyhounds four hits were of the infield variety.
 
The Mules (9-12) set a school record with 24 assists 
in the game. Senior Jenna Van Waalwijk recorded 17 putouts at first base, a total topped in team history once in a 12-inning game and matched in a nine-inning game.

My drop pitch creates a lot of ground balls, and I depend on that to get outs, Sisco noted. It was great having my team behind me 100 percent.

Moravian (15-7) got a runner to third with two outs in the first but never

put two runners on in the same inning until the eighth, which was played under international tiebreaker rules. The Greyhound runner who started on second was sacrificed to third and was thrown out at home trying to score on a grounder to sophomore Brittany Blohm at third.

Sisco started the bottom of the eighth on second base. With the infield drawn in extremely close, leadoff batter Jessica Costa dropped down a bunt on the third-base line. The Moravian fielder tried to get the lead runner, but her throw was not a good one and Sisco slid in safely. 

One out later, Costa stole second on the first pitch to junior Ashley Brewer. The Greyhounds elected to walk the Mules leading hitter intentionally, but Kasza foiled the strategy by lining a 1-1 pitch into center to bring home Sisco with the winning run.

I was very confident with Jess up there, said Sisco. She brings it with her talking, with her hitting and with her fielding. She helps us a ton.

A slow start in the second game put Muhlenberg in an early hole. An infield error with two outs brought in the first run, and two more scored when a pop fly fell in among three Mule fielders. The Greyhounds added another run to go up 4-0.

Muhlenberg got a run back in the bottom of the frame on back-to-back doubles by Brewer and Kasza, but that would be it as the Mules managed just one hit after the first inning.

The doubleheader split gave each school a half-point in the Matte Award standings. Muhlenberg has already clinched the award for the 2009-10 year and holds a 10½-2½ lead with five sports remaining.

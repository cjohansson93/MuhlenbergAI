Horowitz honored for second straight week 





Junior Mike Horowitz of the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team was named Centennial Conference defensive player of the week for the second consecutive week.

Horowitz (left) followed up his 13-save performance against Swarthmore by stopping a career-high 26 shots at Franklin & Marshall. He came up with several huge saves, including one with fewer than 10 seconds left before halftime and four in the first of three overtimes.

Horowitzs 26 saves were the most by a CC goalie since 2005 and the most by a goalie in a CC game since 2004.

For the season Horowitz sports an 8.14 goals-against average and .590 save percentage. He is second in the CC with 10.62 saves per game.

At 3-2 the Mules currently sit alone in fifth place in the CC. They host second-place Dickinson, ranked No. 5 in Division III, on Wednesday.

Men’s Golf: Muhlenberg finished in 10th place at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Invitational. The Mules were ahead of
two other Centennial Conference schools, Franklin & Marshall (11th) and Dickinson (14th). Junior Zachary Oyer
tied for 10th with a 36-hole total of 154. Click here for Muhlenberg box score.

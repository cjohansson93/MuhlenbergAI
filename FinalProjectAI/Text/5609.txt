bascelli named player of the week



Sophomore Alyssa Bascelli of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Bascelli scored a career-high four goals on just five shots in leading the 
Mules to a 13-8 victory against Ursinus on Saturday. It was Muhlenberg’s first-ever win vs. the Bears, snapping an 18-game losing streak.

Bascelli netted the first goal of the game to give the Mules the early lead, then gave Muhlenberg some breathing room by scoring the first two goals of the second
half after Ursinus had cut a four-goal deficit to two late in the first half.

For the season, Bascelli is tied for second on the Mules with 15 goals. Her 18 points rank fourth on the squad and are just two short of her total from all last year. 
Bascelli also leads 5-2 Muhlenberg with 11 caused turnovers.

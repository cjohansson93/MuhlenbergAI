Women's Lacrosse Comeback Falls Short by One
 Wednesday, February 27, 2013 - page 3







					 



This wasn’t the streak the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team wanted to continue.

The Mules traveled to Lebanon Valley with streaks of seven straight wins in season openers and 10 straight wins in non-conference openers. They returned with a 13-12 loss – their sixth consecutive setback by one goal.

As was often the case in the one-goal losses late last year, Muhlenberg came up short despite a great comeback effort. The Mules trailed 7-3 at halftime before scoring five of the first six goals of the second half to draw even at 8-8.

Lebanon Valley then went on a 5-1 run to take a seemingly commanding 13-9 lead with five minutes left. But Muhlenberg came back again, scoring the next three goals, the last with nine seconds left, before running out of time.

Sophomore Stephanie Umbach scored a career-high seven goals. Junior Michelle Certosimo picked up where she left off last season, recording four assists, and senior Molly Davin had two goals and two assists to come within two points of 100 for her career.

Senior Alexandra Franck led the defense with career highs in ground balls (eight) and caused turnovers (five).

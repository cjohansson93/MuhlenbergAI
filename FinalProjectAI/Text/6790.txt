Men's Tennis Win Clinches Matte Award

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team took a break from its quest for a Centennial Conference playoff berth to win one for its school.

The Mules won at Moravian, 7-2, to clinch the 2012-13 Matte Award. Muhlenberg has a 9-6 lead in the annual all-sports competition with one event remaining (in men’s golf). 
Muhlenberg had already clinched a tie for the trophy, and the men’s tennis win ensured the outright title.

Moravian has not won the Matte Award in 10 years. The Lehigh Valley rivals tied for the award in 2007-08 and last year.

The Mules decreased the likelihood of a tie this year by sweeping the doubles. 

In singles play, freshman No. 5 Dylan Ander and sophomore No. 6 Keith
Beizer both won in straight sets, but the top four positions in the lineup all went to third sets. Both sophomore Daniel Lakhman and
junior Jason Teitelbaum won after dropping the first set, with Lakhman (right) coming back after losing the first set 6-0.

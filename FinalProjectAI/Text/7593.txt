Basketball Teams Fall in Scotty Wood Finals
 Saturday, November 22, 2014 - page 4







					 




Both Muhlenberg basketball teams came up short on Scotty Wood Tournament championship night.

The women lost to Scranton, 77-55, and in the men’s game Widener pulled away for a 68-65 win.

The women ran into an impressive Scranton team that is ranked eighth in the D3hoops.com preseason poll.
Muhlenberg took an early 5-3 lead on a three-pointer by senior Abby Stenger (left),
but the Royals shot 61.1 percent from the field in the first half and took a 32-25 edge into the break.

Scranton (4-0) continued its offensive execution in the second half in clinching its third Scotty Wood title in 
eight years.


Seniors Leanna Tallamy and Nicole Pepe were named to the all-tournament team.
Sophomore Caroline Barberi led the Mules (2-2) with nine points in the championship game,
while senior Emily Lesher added seven.

The men’s game was more suspenseful. Widener overcame an early 12-point deficit to take a seven-point lead 
late in the second half. The Pride (4-1) led by five after making a free throw with 20.1 seconds left,
but two layups by senior Malique Killing sandwiched around a pair of free throws cut the deficit
to three with 6.1 ticks on the clock.

Widener stepped out of bounds after inbounding the ball following the second layup, giving Muhlenberg (3-1) a chance.
A three-point attempt bounced off the rim as the final buzzer sounded, however.

Junior Alec Stavetski scored 14 points in the final and joined Killing (16) on the all-tournament team.
Sophomore John Hunter (right) scored a career-high 11 points to go along with six rebounds
 and five blocked shots.

Record Season for Softball Ends in CC Playoffs
 Sunday, May 5, 2013 - page 2







					 





It was a doubly rough day for the family of junior Erica Wenzel: Her younger sister plays for Haverford.



A season of records and celebration ended in disappointment for the Muhlenberg softball team, which was eliminated from the Centennial Conference playoffs with a 7-1 loss
to Haverford.

The Mules, who finished their season with a record of 31-9-1, needed top win three games on the final day of the tournament to win the championship. It has never been done in
CC history, and it was proven again how difficult it is to accomplish: Haverford went on to force a seventh game by beating Washington, 3-1, but the Shorewomen
breezed to a 9-0 win in the winner-take-all contest to claim their first title.

As it did on the first day of the tournament, Muhlenberg struggled on offense against Haverford, with only five hits, none for extra bases. Still, the game was scoreless heading into the
bottom of the fifth thanks to the pitching of sophomore Kelsey Jones, who was in the circle for the third time in less than 24 hours.

After Haverford broke the deadlock with three in the fifth, the Mules got one run back in the top of the sixth. Sophomore Alyssa Schell led off with a single, went to 
second on a groundout and third on a wild pitch and scored when junior Kelly Kline’s deep fly ball was dropped in right field.

The Fords broke open the game with four runs in the bottom of the sixth. Held to three hits through the first six innings, Muhlenberg had two hits in the seventh, both by seniors 
(Devon Barber and Elizabeth Sullivan) in the final at-bats of their careers.

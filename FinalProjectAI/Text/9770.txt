This July, the Digital Learning Team and Trexler Library hosted a presentation of the Mellon Digital Scholars, which featured five students who showcased their summer research projects. The six-week program centered on topics with hands-on methods, techniques, tools and practices within digital scholarship.
The students worked in collaboration with Susan Falciani Maldonado, special collections & archives libarian, Lora Taub, dean of digital learning and professor of media & communication, along with Trexler Library and digital learning staff. The event was not only a celebration of the studentsâ hard work, but a celebration of the ability to collaborate and present research fully in-person. 
âBroadly speaking, this has been a time to reflect on what it means to be researchers together,â said Taub at the beginning of the presentations. âI want to make note of what a joy it has been for those of us returning to campus together to be in The Hive." (The Hive is the nickname of the Digital Learning Center in Trexler Library.)
The program was made possible by Muhlenbergâs grant from The Andrew Mellon Foundation, a foundation focused on practicing the liberal arts and engaging students as partners in pedagogy and scholarship.

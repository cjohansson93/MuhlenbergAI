Men's Golf Puts Two in Top Ten to Take Second at Alvernia
 Thursday, April 19, 2012







					 




A little more than a week before the Centennial Conference Championships, the Muhlenberg men’s golf team was in fine form at the Alvernia Spring Invitational.

Led by a pair of top-10 finishes, the Mules finished second, four shots behind the hosts. Muhlenberg edged out the only other CC team in the field, Ursinus, by two strokes.

Sophomore Chris DiMaio and senior Matthew Cohen both finished tied for sixth, one shot out of third, after carding identical 79s.

DiMaio was one of just three players, and the only one not playing on his home course, to birdie the 203-yard par three fourth hole. He added another birdie on the back nine, which he played at just three-over par, to complete his second sub-80 round of the spring.

Cohen, meanwhile, added a birdie of his own and only recorded one double bogey in his round for his first top-10 finish since last spring.

Senior Jon Heppen (left) also carded a birdie and just missed out on his first top 10, finishing one shot back in a tie for 12th with an 80. Classmate Zack Meyers rounded out the Mule contingent with an 85.

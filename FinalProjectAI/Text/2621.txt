MEN’S SOCCER BLANKS MORAVIAN
Women Lose Despite Comeback; V-ball Splits Again






WOMEN’S SOCCER

An inspired comeback effort fell short as Muhlenberg dropped an exciting
match to Scranton, 3-2.

The Mules (2-1) hit a penalty kick off the crossbar in the 18th minute,
and that was the only shot they would take until midway through the second
half. By that time, the Lady Royals (3-1), who have never lost to
Muhlenberg, had scored two goals and appeared to be in complete control.

They lost control in a heartbeat as the Mules begin to push the action.
A transition goal by freshman Christina O’Grady, off a feed
from senior Elana Rabinowitz, made the score 2-1 with 28:09 left.
That was Muhlenberg’s second shot of the game.

Its third tied the score. Less than six minutes later, junior Maura
Hendsey made a diagonal cross to a wide-open Rabinowitz at the top of
the penalty box. Rabinowitz took a couple of touches and rocketed the ball
into the back of the net.

The Mules also came back from a two-goal second-half deficit in their
opener against Gwynedd-Mercy, but in that game they added a third goal and
went on to win. This time Scranton regrouped to reclaim the lead on a
breakaway goal with 15:48 to play.

Muhlenberg had a great opportunity to tie the game off a corner kick in
the final minute, but Rabinowitz’ point-blank shot was saved.

VOLLEYBALL

Muhlenberg split its matches on Day Two of the
Buttermaker Tournament, placing fifth out of nine teams. The Mules (4-5)
rebounded to defeat Albright 3-1 after dropping a four-game match to York.
 
Senior middle Kate Haggerty was named to the all-tournament team,
her second such honor in as many weeks. For the tournament, the senior
captain totaled 51 kills and 12 blocks.

Megan Eiser continued to shine in her sophomore season, finishing
with double-doubles in both matches. She posted team highs in assists with
26 and 25 while chipping in with 15 and 17 digs. The setter also added a
Muhlenberg tournament high of 14 blocks. 
 
Junior libero Megan Young set a career high with 27 digs, and
freshman Phylicia Lee posted her first career double-double with 10
kills and 17 digs in the Albright victory.

Junior Karim Assous scored a pair of goals as the Muhlenberg
men’s soccer team snapped an unusual slump with a 4-0 home win against
Moravian.

The Mules (3-0) had not defeated their local rivals at Varsity Field since
1994, with the five matches since resulting in three Greyhound wins and
two scoreless ties. However, they have won seven straight against Moravian
in Bethlehem.

Muhlenberg allowed only one shot and scored twice in each half. After






Grannell’s goal was his first since his freshman season of 2003.





struggling to finish in their first two wins, the Mules scored a key early
goal against a Greyhound (0-3-1) team that had taken 12th-ranked Stevens
Tech to overtime.

At the 14:47 mark, sophomore Brendan Carroll played a ball to
Assous on a short breakaway. Assous, right inside the 18, put the ball
past the goalie for a 1-0 lead.

Less than 10 minutes later, a throwin by sophomore Josh Glueck
bounced through the box untouched before sophomore Billy Dalton
settled the ball and lobbed it over the ’keeper’s head for his
first career goal.

Dalton set up Muhlenberg’s first goal of the second half, playing a
ball from the 18 to sophomore Steve Tenenzapf, who was deep in the
box. Tenenzapf passed the ball on the ground to the opposite side of an
open goal for an easy tapin by Assous.

Senior Blake Grannell capped the scoring with a long shot to the
back left corner exactly one minute later.

Assous nearly had a hat trick, but was robbed by the goalie on a great
diving save in the 70th minute.

The win gives Muhlenberg three straight shutouts to start the season for
the first time since 1999. The Mules also have a 2-0 lead in the Matte
Award standings for the 2006-07 year.

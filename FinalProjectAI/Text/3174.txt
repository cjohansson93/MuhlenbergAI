two set records in women’s hoops win





Cook made six of seven field goal attempts and is shooting 67.9 percent for the season.


One of the few things Erin McSherry couldn’t block was the fact that she was on the verge of breaking 
the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team record for career blocked shots.

“I knew all about it,” she said. “My mom reminded me every game. I didn’t really feel any pressure, but it was definitely something I wanted to get sooner rather than later.”

Sooner came in the Mules’ 83-70 win at Swarthmore. McSherry blocked four shots to increase her career total to 119, topping Lisa Ball’s record of 116 that had stood since 1981.

“It definitely means a lot to me,” said McSherry. “And this is a great team to accomplish it with.”

Muhlenberg, ranked 21st in Division III, improved to 5-0 with the win, shooting 46.9 percent en route to a season high in points. And McSherry, who also scored a season-high 11 points, wasn’t the only Mule to break a record.

Alexandra Chili scored a career-high 23 points, setting a school record for freshmen with six three-pointers. She added a career-high eight rebounds and three blocked shots. 

Chili scored 15 points in the first half, nine on three three-pointers in an 18-6 run that gave Muhlenberg a 31-13 lead with 8:14 left in the half. Chili made another three-pointer in a 10-0 second-half run after the Garnet had cut the margin to seven with about six minutes to play.

Joining Chili and McSherry in double figures were sophomores Kelly McKeon (15 points) and Sheila Cook (13). McKeon scored all of her points in the second half, Cook all of hers in the first.

“We have plenty of great players who can get the job done,” said McSherry.

Domestic Violence
Warning signs of an abusive relationship Tips you can do to help protect yourself Resource Agencies
Domestic Violence is when someone you date; a current or past spouse; a family member; an acquaintance or a sexual partner causes physical or psychological harm to you. Unfortunately most cases of domestic violence are not reported to the police.
Violence against anyone is always wrong. You are not at fault. You did not cause the abuse to occur and you are not responsible for the violent behavior of someone else.
If you or someone you know has been the victim of domestic violence, seek help from other family members, friends or a resident advisor. Reach out for support or counseling. Talk with a healthcare provider, especially if you have been physically hurt. Learn how to minimize your risk of becoming a victim before you find yourself in an uncomfortable or threatening situation. Another important part of getting help is knowing you are in an abusive relationship. There are clear signs to help you know if you are being abused.
WARNING SIGNS OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP Do you feel nervous around him/her? Do you have to be careful to control your behavior to avoid his/her anger? Do you feel pressured into sex? Are you afraid to disagree with him/her? Does he/she criticize you in front of classmates? Does he/she always check up or question you about what you have been doing? Does he/she accuse you of seeing other people? Does his/her jealousy stop you from seeing friends or going home to see family? Has he/she ever scared you with violence or threatening behavior? Does he/she prevent you from going out with friends? Makes excuses that alcohol caused his/her behavior toward you?
TIPS YOU CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF Talk to your RA or someone you trust. The more people who know the more people that can watch out for your safety. File a report with Campus Safety Call your local police department and file a report File a Protection from Abuse Order commonly know as a âPFAâ.
If you are the victim of domestic violence, you have the right to go to court and file a petition requesting an order for protection from domestic abuse pursuant to the Protection From Abuse Act (23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61), which could include the following: (1) An order restraining the abuser from further acts of abuse. (2) An order directing the abuser to leave your household. (3) An order preventing the abuser from entering your residence, school, business or place of employment. (4) An order awarding you or the other parent temporary custody of or temporary visitation with your child or children. (5) An order directing the abuser to pay support to you and the minor children if the abuser has a legal obligation to do so. A PFA can be obtained through the Protection from Abuse Office of Lehigh County which is located in the Lehigh County Courthouse (455 Hamilton Street, Room 100 Allentown, PA 18101)
A lawyer is not needed to file a PFA. Legal papers can be filed at the Lehigh County Courthouse. After filing a PFA you will go in front of a judge and ask the court for a temporary protection order. If the judge agrees that you are a the victim of abuse he/she may give you a court order, which may state that the abuser must not hurt you again and that the abuser is to stay away from you and where you live. If there is a violation of the order the abuser may be sent to jail and/or fined. Once you have obtained a temporary protection order and the abuser was served a copy of it, the police can arrest the abuser if the terms of the court order are broken. Once you have received a copy of the order you should place a copy on file with the local police where you live, work, and/or go to school. If a temporary order is issued you will be scheduled for a hearing within 10 days for a final order.
In case of an emergency or if youâve been assaulted after the courthouse has been closed, contact your local police department. A temporary order can be issued before a District Justice. The District Justice will then tell you how to get a final order.

faust, udis earn cc track honors


Junior Alex Faust and senior Stuart Udis of the Muhlenberg track and field program were named co-athletes of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Faust (left) won the 55 meters and 200 meters, the two events with the largest fields, at the Kutztown Invitational, the Mules’ first meet of the season. 
She broke the school record in the 55 and qualified for ECACs in the 200.

Udis won the 1,000 meters and ran on the first-place 4x800 relay team at the Kutztown Invitational.

This is the first year the Centennial Conference is selecting an athlete of the week in track and field, so Faust and Udis are the first Mules to earn the honor.

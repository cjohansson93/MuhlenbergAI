Volleyball Closes in on Playoffs with Defeat of Gettysburg
 Saturday, October 19, 2013 - page 2







					 




Early in the third set of the Muhlenberg volleyball team’s home match against St. Lawrence, junior Lindsey Gambocurta’s attack was blocked right back at her. The ball hit off the top of her head, went back over the net, and fell in for a kill.

“Way to use your head,” joked one of the fans in the stands.




Glass recorded double-doubles in both matches and now has five on the season.




Although the Mules wound up losing that match in five sets, they used their heads – in the figurative sense – in the most important match of the day, a 3-1 win against Gettysburg.

It was only the third win in program history for Muhlenberg (16-8, 6-1) against Gettysburg, and the first two led to playoff appearances. There’s a good chance this one will too. The Mules are in sole possession of second place in the Centennial Conference with three matches to play, and they can clinch a tie for the final playoff berth with a win at 0-7 Ursinus on Wednesday.

Muhlenberg played smart after hitting into eight blocks and splitting the first two sets with the Bullets (13-11, 5-2). Gettysburg had only four blocks in the final two sets – just one in the fourth, in which the Mules hit .345 en route to a decisive 25-12 win.

Freshman Allison Glass led the attack with 16 kills, but it was her serving that put Muhlenberg in control. She had three aces in a span of four serves early in the third set, helping the Mules jump out to an 8-3 lead. The Bullets never got closer than four points until the very end of the set, when they committed a ball handling error to finish off Muhlenberg’s 25-21 win.

In the fourth set, it was a string of blocks that got the Mules off to a good start. Sophomores Joanne Josephson and Sarah Weyhmuller teamed up on blocks three times in four points, and Weyhmuller added a solo block to extend the lead to 10-5. 

Ahead 13-10, Muhlenberg finished off its important win with a 12-2 blitz.

Sophomore Katherine Boll scored the final point with her 10th kill of the match. Weyhmuller had seven kills and seven blocks, while Josephson also recorded seven blocks.

Freshman Elizabeth Garrison (17 digs), sophomore Chelsea Kaser (16) and junior Nikki Dickson (13) led a solid defense that held the Bullets to five kills in the final set. Sophomore Vanessa Pulice had 25 assists.

In the St. Lawrence match, the Mules took a 2-1 lead with a 25-14 win in the third set, but they could not close out the win. Glass led the way again with 17 kills, while Boll added 13.

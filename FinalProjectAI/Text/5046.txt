three teams come up dry at f&m


    


Three Muhlenberg teams returned home from Franklin & Marshall on the losing end, as volleyball was swept in three sets, field hockey lost 4-0, and football was defeated 20-7.

The volleyball and field hockey teams both fell to 4-4 in the Centennial Conference as they prepare for their final two regular-season contests, both at home, this
coming week. Although still in the playoff hunt, both squads could have used wins to strengthen their positions.

The football team gave up three early touchdowns, two resulting from turnovers, and could not recover. The Diplomats had to travel only 29 and 40 yards on their two offensive scoring
drives, one off a fumble and one off a failed fourth-down try. F&M added a third score on a 69-yard return of a fumble with 1:40 left in the first quarter.

The Mule defense kept F&M off the scoreboard the rest of the way, allowing only 180 net yards and eight first downs to a team that came in averaging 33 points and 
almost 400 yards per game. Most of the final three quarters were played in heavy rain, and there was a 35-minute lightning delay in the fourth quarter.

Muhenberg finally put its first points on the board in the third quarter following a 15-play, 68-drive that took 9:28 off the clock. Freshman 
Terrence Dandridge scored on a 5-yard run for his second touchdown of the season.

The Mules put together another long drive early in the fourth quarter, advancing to the F&M 10-yard line on a 46-yard completion from freshman Dan Deighan to 
senior Phil Cresta. Four runs failed to produce any points, however, as Deighan was stopped at the 2 on fourth down.

Deighan, making his first career start, finished 12-of-24 for 103 yards and rushed for a game-high 66 yards on 16 carries. Cresta caught seven passes for 81 yards. 

Junior Patrick McDonough led the Muhlenberg defense with eight tackles. Senior Jake Floyd made three tackles for loss, including a pair of sacks.

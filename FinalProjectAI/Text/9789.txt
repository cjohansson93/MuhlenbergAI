The Society has grown over the years to provide a cohesive program for student involvement in the greater College community, specifically with alumni. Members, known as Keys, also work to develop traditions and instill a sense of school spirit among Muhlenberg students. In partnership with the Office of Alumni Affairs and the Career Center, Keysâ collaborate on events such as Alumni Weekend, Commencement, Honors Convocation, Candlelight Carols, and other campus initiatives.

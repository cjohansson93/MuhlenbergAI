Nickelodeon: A Place for Kids, A Haven for Branding
Nickelodeon first hit airwaves in 1979. Since then, it has become a be-hemoth corporation, spanning just about all media of communication. 
This research project studies toy commercials shown during the net-workâs after-school time slot for two consecutive weeks on November of 2007. Branching off of Dr. Susan Kahlenbergâs 2005 research onNickelodeon, my research focuses on the visual and auditory aspects ofbranding through repetition and âgenderfication.â Nickelodeon was thenetwork of choice because, as one Nickelodeon ad exec once claimed,the network âowns kids aged 2-12.â Nickelodeon, which is owned by
Viacom, filled much of its ad space with commercials from the twomajor toy monopoliesâMattel and Hasbro. This ongoing research seeksnot only to point out trends in branding, but also to consider theramifications that such advertising has on youth.

Film Screenings
Muhlenberg has an active film culture both on and off-campus.  The student-run Muhlenberg Film Association screens two films a semester for the campus community, often outdoors on the College Green.  Faculty regularly arrange special screenings, often accompanied by visiting filmmakers.  The Collegeâs partnership with the Civic Theatre, Allentownâs hub for film and theatre events, has brought special free screenings for students to the Civic, provided students with year-round discounts, and sponsored faculty-led discussions after films.

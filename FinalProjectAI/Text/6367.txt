Baseball Falls to Moravian in First Game Back from Florida
 Tuesday, March 13, 2012 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg baseball team debuted its “digital camo” uniforms for its game against local rival Moravian. For the first eight innings, though,
the only thing in hiding was the Mules’ offense.

After averaging more than 10 runs in their first 11 games of the season, the Mules were blanked until the final frame. They put up three runs in the ninth and got


the tying run to the on-deck circle, but the Greyhounds held on to win, 7-3.

The loss cuts Muhlenberg’s lead in the 2011-12 Matte Award standings to 7-4. The next Matte contest is a softball doubleheader on April 12.

The Mules (9-3) had a runner thrown out at the plate in the top of the third, but other than that did not threaten to score until they loaded the bases with nobody
out in the ninth. One run came in on an infield error and another on a double play.

Sophomore Brett Rosen followed with a single for his third hit of the game, bringing in another run. Freshman centerfielder Jimmy Cody, who
earlier in the game had thrown out a runner trying to stretch a single into a double, kept the rally going with a single, but the next batter flied out to end the game.

The rankings elevator came to a stop on the 13th floor for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team.

The Mules (7-1) moved up one spot to No. 13 in the D3hoops.com national poll through games of December 13 after beating then-No. 12 Moravian last Monday. The Greyhounds 
dropped to No. 17.

Scranton, the team just ahead of Muhlenberg, figures to drop when the next poll comes out after its 70-45 home loss to No. 7 Kean last night. The Royals, who are
responsible for the Mules’ lone loss, also play No. 11 Wis.-Whitewater and No. 8 Trinity in Las Vegas this weekend. Muhlenberg, which is ranked 18th in
the coaches poll, is idle until January 9, when it
returns to action with a home game against Johns Hopkins.

The number 13 hasn’t been the luckiest for the Mules in their history. Their longest winning streak was snapped at 13 games by Swarthmore in 2002.

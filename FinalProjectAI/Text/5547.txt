Golf Teams Wrap Up CC Tourneys


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team could not hold on to its second-round lead and finished second at the Centennial Conference Championships, 17 strokes behind McDaniel.

The Mules shot a 325 in the final round and were overtaken by the Green Terror, which came in with a 304.

Still, Muhlenberg improved its standing at the CC Championships for the third straight year, from seventh in 2005, to fifth in 2006, to fourth last year, to second.

Junior Bill Snow carded an 84 over the final 18 holes to finish ninth. Freshman Zachary Oyer ended the tournament with a 78-78-79, becoming the first Mule golfer since 2003 to shoot in the 70s in all three rounds of the CC Championships.

The Muhlenberg softball team finished a disappointing season on a positive note, blanking Washington 8-0 in the second game of its final doubleheader.

The Shorewomen rallied with four in the bottom of the seventh to win the opener, 9-8. Combined with the second game of Saturday’s twinbill at Ursinus, this was the first time 



Ferrigno knocked in 20 runs for the third consecutive year. She will enter her senior season 13th on Muhlenberg’s all-time list with 63 career RBI.



the Mules scored eight runs in three straight games since 2001.

Freshman Ashley Brewer pitched a three-hitter for her first career shutout in the second game. She struck out six and was masterful after allowing two singles in the first inning, retiring 16 of the final 18 hitters.

Muhlenberg (8-28, 4-12) gave her plenty of early run support, scoring three in the first and two in the second. Freshman Jess Kasza singled in the first run and later scored on a throwing error. Junior RiRi Ferrigno hit a two-out, two-run double in the second.

Brewer helped her own cause with an RBI single in the third, and back-to-back doubles by Kasza and junior Samantha Crist gave the Mules their eighth run.

The first game was full of dramatics and long balls. Ferrigno’s three-run homer – her second in as many games – highlighted a four-run third that put Muhlenberg ahead, 5-1. Washington (9-21, 4-12) answered with four runs in the fifth, including a two-run home run.

Crist broke the 5-5 tie by belting a three-run round-tripper in the top of the seventh, but the Shorewomen pieced together four singles, two walks and an error to win the game in the bottom of the inning.

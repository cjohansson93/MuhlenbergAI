The Center for Ethics Living & Learning Experience (CELLE)was an annual program co-sponsored by the Center for Ethics and the Office of Residential Services. Participants in the CELLE include 8 students (sophomore, juniors, and seniors only) selected annually from a pool of applicants, who live together in 2 suites in an on-campus residential facility. These students are mentored by one Faculty Scholar-Residence, also selected annually. Together, the Faculty Scholar-in-Residence and the CELLE students form a living-learning community based in the residence hall that explores issues raised by Center for Ethics programming.
The Living & Learning Experience program is not longer active.

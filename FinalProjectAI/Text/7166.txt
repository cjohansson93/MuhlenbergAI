Shorthanded Women’s Tennis Hangs Tough


Despite missing its top two players with injuries and having a third singles starter studying abroad for the semester, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis
team put on a strong showing in its first dual match of the fall.

Playing against an undefeated (7-0) Stevens team, the Mules lost, 6-3, and weren’t far from pulling out the win. Of their four singles losses, two were in 
three sets and another was 7-5, 7-5.

Junior Ashlee Ludwig won at both doubles and singles, teaming up with sophomore Jenny Levenson at No. 3 doubles and breezing
6-0, 6-2 at No. 5 singles. Freshman Jamie Rosenblum earned Muhlenberg’s other point with a straight-sets win at No. 3 singles.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team suffered its third straight 2-1 road loss, falling at Moravian in the second Matte Award contest of the 2013-14 year.


The Mules (2-5) took early leads in the first two 2-1 losses, but this time they were the ones trying to come back. The Greyhounds (6-3) scored two goals in a span of less than four minutes midway through the first half to jump on top. Muhlenberg did not get off a shot until the last few minutes of the first half.

The second half was a different story, as the Mules mounted pressure for most of the final 35 minutes. They finally got on the scoreboard when senior Dayna Hovern pushed a shot past the Moravian goalie for her 13th career goal with 24:48 to play (left).

Muhlenberg dodged a bullet and remained within one when the Greyhounds shot high and wide on a penalty stroke nine minutes later. The Mules had two penalty corners in the last 10 minutes but could not net the equalizer.

Junior Sierra Lenker made seven saves, and junior Ray Gallagher added a defensive save. The result evened the Matte Award standings at 1-1, with a women’s tennis match at Muhlenberg next Thursday next on the slate.

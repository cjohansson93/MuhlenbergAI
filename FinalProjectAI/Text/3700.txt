volleyball finishing up strong





Gordon is averaging 2.89 kills per set and hitting .331 in the last six matches.


For many 6-20 teams, the end of the season can't come fast enough, but for Muhlenberg volleyball, it's coming up too soon.

The Mules continued their late-season surge, sweeping Ursinus in three sets. Muhlenberg, which 


closes out its campaign at Gettysburg on Saturday, has won four of its last five matches, all with 3-0 sweeps.

Junior Davi Gordon recorded her fourth double-double of the season with a match-high 12 kills and 10 digs, sophomore Jenn Seeba hit a spectacular .692 on 9 kills and no errors in 13 attempts, and freshman Morgan Duggan had a solid match with 31 assists, 10 digs and 4 aces.

The Mules not only won, but they did it in impressive fashion, turning away challenges from the Bears in each of the first two sets before taking the third by a wide margin.

In the opening set, Muhlenberg jumped out to an 11-4 lead, but appeared to be in danger of dropping the set when Ursinus scored five straight points to take its first lead, 23-22. The Mules regrouped to tie the match back up at 23, 24 and 25, then scored the final two points. Duggan's ace finished off the 27-25 win.

Muhlenberg needed to work overtime again to take a tight second set in which neither team led by more than three points. The Mules had set point at 24-22 after another ace by Duggan, but the Bears ran off the next three points to get a set point of their own. Ursinus was ahead 27-26 before consecutive kills by freshman Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare, junior Brooke McQueen and Gordon gave Muhlenberg the set, 29-27.

The third set was free from dramatic endings thanks to a 9-0 run with Duggan serving. Back-to-back kills by Ojo-Ohikuare highlighted the run, which gave the Mules an 18-11 lead en route to a match-clinching 25-15 victory.

McQueen led the Mules with 17 digs, and freshman Erica Wenzel added 13.

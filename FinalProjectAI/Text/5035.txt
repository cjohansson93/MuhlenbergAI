Three Muhlenberg College teams – men’s soccer, women’s soccer and volleyball – qualified to compete in the Centennial Conference playoffs this week. The winners of the CC tournaments receive an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament in their respective sports.

Both Muhlenberg soccer teams earned the top seed and will host the semifinals and final this weekend. Since the CC went to a postseason tournament in 2001, this is the third time the same school has earned the right to host both tournaments. Muhlenberg pulled the double in 2003 and Johns Hopkins did in 2006. 


Men’s soccer will start on Friday night with what figures to be an incredibly competitive tournament. The top four seeds have a combined record of 50-10-8 and have all received votes in the national poll this year.

Second-seeded Swarthmore (14-1-2) will take on third-seeded Johns Hopkins (13-3-2) in the first semifinal, followed by the Mules (11-3-2) against the winner of the first-round game between Dickinson (12-3-2) and Franklin & Marshall (9-5-3). The semifinal winners meet Saturday night at 7:00 for the championship.

Close games have been a hallmark of the CC playoffs of late: Of the 12 games played since 2005, seven were decided by one goal (four in overtime), and four went to penalty kicks.

Muhlenberg is the fifth different school to host the CC men’s soccer tournament in the last five years. The top seed has won the title five of eight times, including Muhlenberg when it last hosted in 2003 and Swarthmore last year. 

Johns Hopkins and Muhlenberg are the only schools who have participated in all eight CC tournaments, with the Blue Jays advancing to the final six times. Hopkins has won a league-high seven championships, two more than Muhlenberg.

The women’s soccer tournament also should be closely contested, as the five qualifiers are a combined 65-17-3. Ironically, the only one of the teams that has not received votes in the national poll this year is Muhlenberg, the top seed.

The Mules (12-5), who have hosted more tournaments (four) than any other school in the CC, will face the winner of the first-round game between Swarthmore (13-4) and Dickinson (14-3) in one Saturday semifinal. Dickinson handed Muhlenberg its lone CC loss of the season.

Four-time defending champion Johns Hopkins (14-3) matches up with Haverford (12-2-3) in the other semifinal. The championship match is slated for Sunday at 2:00.

The top seed took advantage of playing on its home field in six of the first eight tournaments, including the Mules in 2001 and 2003. Last year, all four tournament games were decided by one goal or went into penalty kicks. 

The Muhlenberg volleyball team earned a berth to the CC playoffs for the first time since 2001. The fifth-seeded Mules (11-12) will travel to Swarthmore for a first-round match on Wednesday, with the winner joining the other qualifiers at three-time defending champion Haverford over the weekend.

Both teams are in the playoffs for only the second time. Muhlenberg split its two matches in 2001, falling in the final to Gettysburg, and Swarthmore (18-9) lost a first-round match to Franklin & Marshall in 2005. The Garnet, who finished ninth in the CC last year, defeated the Mules in four sets in their regular-season meeting.

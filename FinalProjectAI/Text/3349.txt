baseball falls to dickinson





Sophomore Eli Branzburg slid around the tag of the Dickinson catcher to score the Mules’ first run of the game.


The Muhlenberg baseball team dropped the second game of its two-day series with Dickinson.

The Red Devils (9-19, 5-9) jumped out to an 8-1 lead after three innings and went on to a 14-9 victory.

Trailing 14-4 heading into the bottom of the eighth, the Mules (10-19-1, 4-8) made things interesting by scoring
five runs on three straight doubles, a triple and a wild pitch. But Dickinson got out of the inning without further
damage, and Muhlenberg went down 1-2-3 in the ninth.

Senior Eric Hammond went 4-for-5 with a pair of bunt singles. Senior Edward Risener was 3-for-4, and junior
Dan Fisher hit his 12th double of the season to move within one of the school record.

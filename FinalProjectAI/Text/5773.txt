Men’s Soccer Cancelled


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s scheduled game at Drew was cancelled due to lightning with the Rangers up 1-0 at halftime.




Junior Megan Eiser of the Muhlenberg volleyball team was named co-player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Eiser hit .361 and averaged 9.82 assists and 2.82 digs per game in a 2-1 week for the Mules. She recorded 
her first career triple double in a four-game win against Delaware Valley, with 37 assists, 11 digs and a career-high 11 kills (in only 16 attempts). 

For the season, Eiser leads Muhlenberg in assists (622) and is tied for second in blocks (32), tied for third in kills (98) and fourth in digs (201). She has climbed 
to fifth on the program’s all-time assists list with 1,311 for her career.

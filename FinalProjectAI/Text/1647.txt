The Muhlenberg Theatre Association presents Cabaret, considered one of the most notorious stage musicals of the 20 th century, in the Baker Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance of Muhlenberg College from October 28 - November 6, 2005. Opening week performances are Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m. The show continues Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.
Inspired by characters in Christopher Isherwood’s stories and novels, Cabaret is an extraordinary musical that continues to entertain and provoke audiences. An Anglo-American novelist and playwright, Isherwood lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933, gaining an outsider's view of the simultaneous decay of the struggling Weimar Republic and the frightening rise to power of Adolf Hitler.
Isherwood captured both the glittering and grotesque in Berlin’s cabarets, casting his photographic eye on the sexual exploits, political intrigues, and prevalent vices that exploded in this tumultuous era. For the price of a few drinks, audiences enjoyed an intimate and adventurous evening. Particularly in Germany, where the Weimar government essentially ended all forms of censorship and opened the doors to a frenzied sexual liberation, the glittering night life of the cabarets thrived on political, social and sexual satire. The hardships of inflation, depression and unemployment prevalent in Germany were willingly left outside the door in favor of irreverent and erotic entertainment.
New York director Harold Prince, who had been stationed in Germany in 1951 and experienced the strangely hedonistic club scene, spent three years working on a musical based on the Isherwood stories with collaborators Joe Masteroff, John Kander and Fred Ebb. As they worked on bringing Sally Bowles and other Isherwood characters to the stage, the cabaret became the biting metaphor for the incredible vitality, glaring sexuality and moral decadence of Berlin and the disturbing political transformation of Germany.
Prince’s original production of Cabaret opened on Broadway to great acclaim in 1966, was adapted into film in 1972, and was successfully revived on Broadway in 1987.
The show begins with Cliff, a young American novelist, on the train to Berlin. Ernst, a German businessman, places his briefcase among Cliff’s luggage at the German border and then uses the opportunity to make Cliff’s acquaintance. That simple act will be the catalyst for the friends Cliff will make, the place he will live, and the woman he will love in Berlin – Sally Bowles.
Sally Bowles is a wild and sensual performer at the Kit Kat Club. Far from the increasingly hostile streets of Berlin, the Kit Kat Club offers the delusion that all women are beautiful and life is whatever anyone wants it to be. Cliff and Sally begin a briefly wonderful but ultimately heartbreaking relationship, doomed by the world collapsing around them.
 Cabaret juxtaposes the cabaret songs in the Kit Kat Club (“Willkommen”) with the complex narratives of Cliff and Ernst in an increasingly dangerous city (“What Would You Do?”). Neighbors Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz also find it possible to love each other, but the reverberation of the rising Nazi party shakes all of them out of their innocence. As the show continues, the cabaret act becomes more political and the behavior more undesirable. By the end of the musical, the anthem of young Germans (“Tomorrow Belongs to Me”) anticipates the rise of Hitler and the shocking political turmoil on the horizon.
Directing is Charles Richter, Director of Theatre at Muhlenberg College. Designing the Muhlenberg stage production is Timothy Averill; costumes are designed by Constance Case, choreography by Karen Dearborn, and musical direction by Ken Butler – each faculty and/or staff at Muhlenberg College.
The cast features guest artists Francine Roussel as Fraulein Schneider and P. Brendan Mulvey as Herr Schultz. Roussel is on the theatre faculty of Muhlenberg College and continues her professional acting career; she most recently performed in Sidney Pollack’s most recent film entitled The Interpreter. Mulvey is based in the Philadelphia area and has enjoyed a 25-year career in acting - one of his favorite roles playing Herr Schultz in the National Broadway Tour of Cabaret.Kennedy Kanagawa’08 is the Emcee. His Broadway and New York credits include A Christmas Carol at Madison Square Garden, Falsettoland , and Tribute to William Finn. Courtney Romano’06 is Sally Bowles; she has performed in the Muhlenberg productions of Summerfolk, Pippin, Into the Woods, A Chorus Line and Annie Get Your Gun. Theo Rutherford ‘08 is Clifford Bradshaw; he previously appeared in the MTA’s Pippin and The Pirates of Penzance and is a member of the St. Mark’s Players where he has played Jack in Lord of the Flies and Thomas Jefferson in 1776.

 CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD 
Christopher Isherwood's best-known fictional work, popularly entitled “The Berlin Stories,” is in actuality a pair of loosely structured novels: Mr Norris Changes Trains (1935) and Goodbye to Berlin (1939), considered one of the most significant political novels of the 20 th Century. “The Berlin Stories” inspired the play I Am a Camera (1951; film 1955) and the Broadway musical Cabaret (1966; film 1972). Isherwood's novels were based largely on his own life. Many of his famous literary friends appeared in his books under different names, including W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Virginia Woolf. In 1938 Isherwood started with Auden a journey to China, and recorded in Journey to a War (1939) his experiences in the country ravaged by civil war and a Japanese invasion. During 1941-42, he worked at a Quaker hostel in Pennsylvania with refugees from Europe. With Auden, he emigrated to the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1946. Isherwood settled in in southern California, where he worked as a teacher and wrote for Hollywood films. In 1975 he won the Brandeis Medal for Fiction.

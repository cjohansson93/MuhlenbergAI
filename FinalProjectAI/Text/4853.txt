They may not make Dan Fisher a saint, like they did with 16th-century cleric John Fisher, but what he did at Limeport Stadium was pretty impressive nonetheless.

The Muhlenberg senior doubled in the go-ahead run 




Freshman Ryan Rechten pitched the two innings in between Fisher’s two appearances and earned his first career win.




and made two pitching appearances as the Mules won the second game of a doubleheader against St. John Fisher, 10-8. The Cardinals took the first game, 5-2, and won the three-game series, two games to one.

With St. John Fisher having already scored a run in the top of the sixth to take a 3-1 lead, Fisher was summoned from his shortstop position to close the door with two out and the bases loaded. After getting a flyout to end the inning, he returned to shortstop.

Then after Muhlenberg plated six runs in the bottom of the eighth to pull ahead 10-5, Fisher returned to the mound. Although he gave up three runs, he retired the final three batters to end the game.

I havent done that since Little League, joked Fisher about 



Softball Swept at Gettysburg


The Muhlenberg softball team’s defense of its 2009 Centennial Conference championship got off to a rocky start – and finish.

Gettysburg scored 10 runs in the bottom of the first inning of Game 1 and went on to win, 10-0. In the second game, the Mules took a 3-1 lead
in the top of the sixth on back-to-back RBI hits by junior Jess Kasza and sophomore Shelby Smith, but the Bullets plated three runs
in the bottom of the seventh to complete the sweep with a walkoff 4-3 win.

Junior Ashley Brewer led off Game 2 with her third home run of the season.

pitching twice in the same game. My arms conditioned for that, and whenever Coach wants to put me in Im happy to do it.

It didnt look like Muhlenberg (6-7) would need Fisher to close out a win after St. John Fisher scored runs in four consecutive innings to open up a 5-1 lead. But the Mules got back in the game on one swing of the bat by one-man wrecking crew Joseph DiCecilia, who hit a three-run triple onto the hill in center field in the bottom of the seventh.

DiCecilia, who also hit a home run leading off the second, went 9-for-12 with five extra-base hits and 10 RBI in the three-game series.

Muhlenberg trailed 5-4 in the bottom of the eighth when junior Bobby Spindler hit a one-out double and advanced to third on a wild pitch. After junior Clint Lynch was hit by a pitch, freshman Steve Alfano poked the ball through the drawn-in infield to bring in Spindler with the tying run.

Fisher, the next batter, doubled to left-center to bring in Lynch and put the Mules ahead, 6-5. After scoring behind Alfano on an infield error, Fisher turned his attention to pitching while Muhlenberg took advantage of Cardinal misplays to tack on two more runs.

I did that in Florida, against Alvernia, driving in the winning run and then going out to pitch, said Fisher. Mentally, it kind of messes with you, because youre on a high and then you have to calm down. I didnt calm down enough and gave up a few runs, but it was good enough.

Good enough to finish off a rough stretch on a high note. The Mules, who are scheduled to open up Centennial Conference play at Swarthmore on Tuesday, played five games in four days at three different sites close to home, but none at home while renovations continue at Cedarcreek Field. Muhlenberg went 2-3 in the five games but was very competitive in all but one.

It was a tough week, said Fisher. But our young guys are coming together and our older guys are giving good leadership. Were going to be some trouble in the Centennial Conference.

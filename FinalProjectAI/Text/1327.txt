Who was Harold Weiss '52, '78HON?
As a young man, Bishop Harold âHalâ Weiss â52, '78HON sold chickens on his family farm each summer to pay his Muhlenberg tuition. After World War II, he became a theologian, a pastor and a beloved bishop within the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1978, Weiss was awarded with an honorary doctorate of divinity. After two distinguished terms as a Muhlenberg trustee, the board bestowed on Hal its highest honor - the designation of Life Trustee.  Individuals whose wisdom, insight and diplomacy are so valued to the College they are elected Life Trustees - leaders with no term limits for whom there is always a seat at the table of governance and decision making. Hal represented the gold standard of board service and led with dignity and intention until his passing in August 2017.To honor Halâs memory, and to perpetuate his process of thoughtful leadership, the Board established the Weiss Fellowship program.For questions or more information, contact WeissFellow@muhlenberg.edu or the President's Office at 484-664-3125.

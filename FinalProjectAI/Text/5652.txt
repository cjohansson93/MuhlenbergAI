The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team gave an inspired effort in the first of its four early games against nationally ranked teams, but No. 20 Stevens held on to win, 7-5, in the season

opener for both teams.

The Mules, who open Centennial Conference play in March with consecutive games against nationally ranked Washington, Gettysburg and Haverford, outshot the Ducks, 31-20, and nearly erased a four-goal second half deficit.

Down 6-2 late in the third quarter, Muhlenberg began its comeback when senior Josh Mosberg scored his first career goal. Junior Andrew Lolley completed his third career hat trick by scoring twice in a span of 1:28 early in the fourth quarter, and with 10:45 on the clock suddenly the Mules were within a goal.

Muhlenberg’s best chance to tie the score came when a Duck player was penalized for slashing with 6:03 left, but the Stevens man-down unit not only killed off the penalty, it also scored an insurance goal. The Mules were 0-for-8 on extra-man chances on the night.

A Muhlenberg goal with 4:22 left was disallowed because the scorer entered the crease.

Junior John DeLuca picked up a game-high six ground balls and scored a goal, leading a defense that held Stevens well below its 2007 average of 15.55 goals per game, which ranked second in Division III. Senior Luke LaMarca went 5-for-7 on faceoffs.

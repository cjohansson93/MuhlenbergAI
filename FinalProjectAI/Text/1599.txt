Richard F. Brueckner ’71, of Bedminster, N.J., was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the group’s April 21-22 meeting. He assumes his new responsibilities effective July 1, 2005. Previously, he served as the Board’s vice chair. 
“Every College hopes to have an alumnus as accomplished and passionate about education as Rich Brueckner,” said College President Peyton R. Helm. “Muhlenberg is doubly blessed - first, by Rich's distinguished past service, and now, by his willingness to assume the ultimate volunteer leadership role on the Board of Trustees. Rich and his family are deeply woven into the fabric of this special place. I am looking forward to working with him as we continue Muhlenberg's extraordinary momentum into the top echelons of private liberal arts institutions.” 
Brueckner is Chief Executive Officer of the Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. He is a governor of the NASD and director of the NASD-Regulation, Inc. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Securities Industry Association. He is a trustee of the Foundation for Investor Education and was Chairman of its predecessor organization, the Securities Industry Foundation for Economic Education. He has previously served on the boards of the United Way of Hudson County, N.J., the Frontier Trust Company, Archipelago, LLC and the Depository Trust Company among others.
Brueckner has earned the Baker Award for Advancement of Economic Literacy from the National Council on Economic Education, as well as an award for outstanding service to the capital markets from the American Museum of Financial History.
His wife, Laurie, graduated from Muhlenberg in 1972, and his son Eric graduated in 2004.
Other members of the College’s Board of Trustees elected to leadership positions at the group’s April meeting were: Thomas Mendham ’63, of Loveladies, N.J., first vice chair; Tammy Bormann, of Long Valley, N.J., second vice chair. Richard Romeo, Esq. ’79, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., was re-elected as secretary to the Board of Trustees, a position he has held since November 2002.
Established in 1848, Muhlenberg College is a highly selective, liberal arts school in Allentown, Pa.

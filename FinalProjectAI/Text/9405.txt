President Williams announced the change in February. The policy prohibits the use of all smoke and tobacco products, including cigarettes, e-cigarettes (including Juul) and smokeless tobacco, on College property.
Greg Kantor â18 conducted independent research during his time as a public health major at Muhlenberg that showed broad community support for such a policy. He surveyed more than 500 students, faculty and staff, including plant operations workers and Sodexo employees. More than two-thirds of respondentsâincluding some who identified as smokersâsaid they were in favor of a move toward a smoke- and tobacco-free policy.
âItâs so rewarding to see all my efforts were not only valued but are going toward a positive change on our campus,â says Kantor, who is now pursuing his masterâs in public health at the Boston University School of Public Health.
âIt really does go to show, at least at Muhlenberg, that a small group of people with a vision for how to improve health can effect change.â
In the coming months, the College will offer education sessions and help connect members of the community who are interested in quitting with cessation programs.
âWeâre committed as a College to providing a safe and healthy environment for our students, faculty, staff and visitors,â says Chrysan Cronin, director and assistant professor of public health, who leads a team of faculty, staff and students in planning the transition. âWe are proudly joining more than 2,000 colleges and universities throughout the country that have become smoke- and tobacco-free campuses.â

Rice to compete at NCAAs


Peter Rice of the Muhlenberg track and field team is become quite accustomed to central Ohio.

The junior will make his second trip to the Buckeye State in less than three months when he competes in the 400 meters at this weekend's NCAA Outdoor Championships hosted by Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. 

Rice, the first Mule sprinter to qualify for the national meet, also competed at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March at Capital University, which is about 30 miles south of Ohio Wesleyan.

The owner of eight school records and the two-time reigning Centennial Conference Most Outstanding Performer for track events, Rice is seeded 12th out of 19 runners with a qualifying time of 48.09. He is only the second Mule male athlete to qualify for both the indoor and outdoor championships in the same event in the same year.

The prelims for the 400 are scheduled for 7:00 Friday evening, with the finals set for 2:40 on Saturday.

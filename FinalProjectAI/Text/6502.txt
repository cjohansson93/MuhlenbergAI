Women's Soccer Loses Final Scheduled Home Game to Moravian
 Tuesday, October 23, 2012







					 




It hasn’t just been “first team to score wins” for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team. It’s been “first team to score is the only 
team to score.” 

The Mules fell to Lehigh Valley rival Moravian, 1-0, in their last scheduled home game of the season. It was Muhlenberg’s 14th straight game that ended in
a shutout one way or the other (including one scoreless tie). The Mules (7-8-2) haven’t played a game in which both teams scored since the first week of September.

The Greyhounds (9-7-1) took advantage of a Muhlenberg giveaway to score the game’s lone goal early in the second half. Although the offense could not net the
equalizer, the defense (including junior Stephanie Tramutola, left) held the deficit at one goal. Over the last 16 games, the only opponent to score
more than one goal against the Mules is second-ranked Messiah.

The result tied the Matte Award standings for 2012-13 at 2-2. Upcoming Matte contests are in volleyball (tomorrow at Moravian), football (November 10 at Moravian) and
men’s and women’s cross country (November 10 at Dickinson).

Muhlenberg now turns its attention back to the Centennial Conference playoff race. The Mules can clinch a berth by winning their regular-season finale at Ursinus on
Saturday. If they are able to do that, they will open the postseason next Wednesday, either home vs. Swarthmore or at Haverford.

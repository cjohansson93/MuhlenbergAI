strong frontcourt helps men's basketballoverwhelm Garnet





Hargrove is averaging 8.0 points and 6.9 rebounds per game this season.



The Muhlenberg mens basketball team is upwardly mobile.

The Mules, who were in sixth place in the Centennial Conference less than two weeks ago, moved into a tie for second place with a 67-52 win at Swarthmore.

With five games left in the regular season, Muhlenberg (12-8, 8-5) is deadlocked with McDaniel, Dickinson and Gettysburg, three games behind Franklin & Marshall and a game ahead of Haverford as teams scramble for the five playoff berths.

To keep rising in the standings, the Mules won their last two games against teams they needed to beat  the bottom two teams in the standings. 





Senior Evan Tozer scored 7 points and played outstanding defense on the Garnets leading scorer, holding him to 5-of-16 shooting.




And just like Saturdays 54-48 grind-it-out win against Johns Hopkins, this one didnt come easy.

Muhlenberg shot just 25 percent in the first half and went into the locker room tied at 26. But the Mules stormed out of the gates to start the second half, scoring on six of seven possessions and going on an 11-0 run to take control of the game.

Fittingly, the run started with a basket by freshman Kevin Hargrove and ended with one by junior Spencer Liddic. The frontcourt duo proved to be too much for the Garnet (5-15, 2-11) all night, combining for 28 points, 20 rebounds and 5 blocked shots.

Hargrove had 15 points and 12 rebounds for his third double-double. He also blocked 4 shots, moving to within 4 of the school record of 58 in a season. Liddic finished with 13 points and 8 rebounds.

Unlike the teams first meeting, in which Muhlenberg squandered an early 18-point lead and needed a basket in the final seconds to win by one, the Mules stayed aggressive, stretching their lead to as many as 19 points. After committing 10 turnovers in the first half, the Mules lost possession only three times in the second half.

Freshman Austin Curry led all scorers with 16 points, and sophomore Matt OHara contributed 7 points and 4 steals.

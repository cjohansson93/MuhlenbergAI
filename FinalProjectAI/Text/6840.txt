 Monday, April 15, 2013







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team moved over .500 in the Centennial Conference for the first time this season with an 8-1 home win against Bryn Mawr.

The Mules (4-8, 4-3), who hosted two regionally ranked teams last week, were playing the second of three straight matches against teams that are currently winless in the CC.
They defeated McDaniel, 8-1, on Saturday, and travel to Ursinus on Wednesday.



Muhlenberg was tied 1-1 against Bryn Mawr with senior Amanda von Taube and junior Gabriela Contino locked in a tight No. 3 doubles match. 
The Mules finally won, 8-6, when von Taube put away a shot at the net (right).

Singles play was not as close, with Muhlenberg winning handily at four of the six spots. Von Taube posted a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 5, and sophomore Sharen
Resnikoff won 6-0, 6-2 at No. 4.
 
Juniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman, who earlier teamed up for their fourth straight win at No. 1 doubles, prevailed in straight
sets at the top two singles spots, with Szulman losing only one game.

The Muhlenberg men’s golf team recorded its best finish of the spring, tying for third at the two-day Glenmaura National Collegiate Invitational.

Junior Christopher Lucarelli (left) improved by five strokes from 79 to 74 in the second round to finish in fifth place, seven strokes off
the lead. The 74 tied the lowest round of his Mule career.

Junior Chris DiMaio also shot in the 70s both days, coming in 12th with a 157. Senior Brandon Davis was one stroke and one place behind.

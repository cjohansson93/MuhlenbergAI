The Interlibrary Loan service provides access to materials not owned by Trexler Library.
Interlibrary Loan (ILL) service supports the study and research needs of Muhlenberg College students, faculty, staff, alumni/ae, and some affiliates.
The ILL office will gladly obtain materials from any library for our students, faculty, and staff. College students, faculty, and staff may also borrow materials directly on-site from each Lehigh Valley College Libraries.
As part of the larger interlibrary loan community, the Office also provides items from College collections to libraries around the world.
Loan Status
Please contact the Interlibrary Loan office (484-664-3510 or illd@muhlenberg.edu) to determine the status of your interlibrary loan requests.

Interlibrary Loan Policy
Muhlenberg Faculty, Staff, Students, Alumni, along with Clergy may make interlibrary loan requests.  You may request journal articles, books, or chapters of books via interlibrary loan.
Requests for Interlibrary Loan items can be made electronically by using Encompass Search or the Interlibrary Forms located above.  When filling in the form use your college ID in the field after your name, not your password. If your browser auto-fills this field please delete it and type your college ID number there instead.
The lender chooses the due date so Trexler Library must comply with the due date given for each book.  Many times renewals can be requested and are granted. Some libraries choose not to renew books but will originally give a longer due date.
A $2.00 a day fine is accrued per interlibrary loan book for students, alumni, and clergy.  To avoid a fine please ask for a renewal on or before the due date by using the phone number or email listed on the strap of the book.  Please keep your book during the time you wait for a renewal. When you are ready to return your interlibrary loan book please drop it off at Lending Services or in the drop box located by the front doors of Trexler Library.
An email address is needed to receive a copy request.  If you have a Muhlenberg email, that is the email that must be used on the Interlibrary Loan request form.  If a different email is used, we can not guarantee you will receive the email. Please type in your full email on the form to be sure your item is delivered promptly.
Many libraries refuse to loan books published in the current year.
Trexler Library tries to obtain your interlibrary loan materials in a timely manner.  Many materials will arrive within a week of your request. There are circumstances that could extend the amount of time it takes to receive your requested material.
Trexler Library Interlibrary Loan is available to assist you with your questions. You may contact us via email, phone or stop by the office. The email is illd@muhlenberg.edu and the phone number is 484-664-3510. The Interlibrary Loan office is located next to Lending Services.

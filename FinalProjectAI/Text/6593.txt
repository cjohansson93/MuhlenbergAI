Field Hockey Enjoys Rare Breather in Win at Dickinson
 Saturday, September 29, 2012 - page 3







					 


The Muhlenberg field hockey team can win the close wins, and now we know it can win the ones that aren’t so close too.



For once, the Mules got to relax a little in the closing minutes of a game, snapping their two-game Centennial Conference winning streak with a 4-0 win at Dickinson.

Muhlenberg’s first five wins of the season all came by one goal, including two in overtime. Prior to junior Erin Cummings scoring her second goal of the game seven minutes into the second half, the Mules (6-3, 2-2) had not led by more than two goals or trailed by more than two goals all season.

Cummings (right) got the scoring started early, netting her first goal of the season off a cross from sophomore Samantha Swire just 3:17 into the game.

The Red Devils (4-6, 0-4) pushed for a tying goal late in the first half, but Muhlenberg came out strong after the break. Junior Dayna Hovern made it 2-0 just 57 seconds into the second half, and Cummings made it 3-0 shortly thereafter.

It was the first multiple-goal game for Cummings, who came in with a career total of three goals. The only bad part about it was that her parents weren’t on hand to see it – one of the few games they’ve missed.

“Maybe they’re bad luck,” she joked.

Freshman Gabrielle Smith capped the scoring by converting a penalty stroke with about 12 minutes left for her first career goal. 

Dickinson took six shots in the last five minutes, but sophomore Sierra Lenker made a couple of saves in her first action of the season to preserve the shutout. Senior Kristen Dornenburg started and recorded five saves, helping the Mules record back-to-back shutouts for the first time since early in the 2009 season.

“Our backs are super strong,” said Cummings. “They’ll throw their bodies around to block anything to keep the ball from going in.”

Muhlenberg will need some more good defense in October as it plays the bulk of its CC schedule. The Mules, who have surpassed their 2011 total of five wins, have six league games left to play.

“It’s awesome to get this win,” said Cummings. “We had some good practices this week, and we’re ready to go play some more conference games.”

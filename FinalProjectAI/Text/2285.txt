In the Lehigh Valley, independent colleges and universities produced 5,350 jobs and had a total economic impact of $1.2 billion in 2014. In addition to Muhlenberg, Lehigh Valley independent colleges and universities include Albright College, Alvernia University, Cedar Crest College, DeSales University, Lafayette College, Lehigh University and Moravian College.
"All of us at Muhlenberg College are proud of the positive impact we have on our surrounding communities, including the tremendous economic impact cited here," says John Williams, President of Muhlenberg College. "We are also proud of the many other ways in which our students, faculty and staff have substantial and enduring impact on our neighboring communities as a result of our personal engagement."
AICUP found that independent colleges in Pennsylvania enroll approximately 290,000 students, representing 42% of the state total; produce 49% of the total degrees and receive just 11% of state funding for higher education. Independent colleges represent the fourth-largest employment sector in the state, according to the 2012 County Business Patterns report, U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Message to Students from President Harring

Friday, March 13, 2020

Dear Students,
The past few days have been a blur of emotions for all of us. Things moved so quickly that once decisions started to be made they only raised more questions. There isnât anyone at the College, including myself, who didnât need to turn to someone for help in navigating what has been an extremely difficult week. I am so proud of all our students here at Muhlenberg. You have been smart and gracious and pressed us in some very important ways, and for that, I want to thank you.
I have heard from many of you over these past few days. You have expressed your anguish and frustration over having your spring semester plans upended. Some of you have been calm and reflective, others stressed and vocal, and thatâs alright. There is no right way to react to the circumstances caused by the coronavirus health crisis. But there will come a time very soon, when you can stop and take a breath and begin to think about whatâs next. Your remote learning classes will start on Wednesday. They may seem awkward at firstâyou may not feel comfortable or confident in the new format. Please remember that what makes the Muhlenberg community special is our relationships, particularly those between you and your professors. Make sure to use whatever means necessary to remain in contact with our faculty and staff and know that their focus remains on your success.
During the time you are away from campus, we will remain in touch and provide updates. We look forward to finding the means for us to gather again as a community to support one another and to acknowledge our achievements. You will be missed while you are away from campus.
I wish you safe travels as you leave campus and encourage you to take care of yourself and those you care about. Each of you is a special member of our Muhlenberg family and we look forward to your return.
Be well,
Kathleen Harring Interim President

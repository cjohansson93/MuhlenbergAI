Women’s tennis clinches matte tie




Men's Lacrosse Falls at Home for First Time


Despite holding a three-goal lead heading into the fourth quarter, the Muhlenberg men's lacrosse team lost to Swarthmore, 7-6. 

With the game tied at the half, 3-3, the Mules (3-5, 1-2) turned up the defensive pressure and shut the Garnet out in the third quarter. 

Muhlenberg's offense, meanwhile, built a cushion behind goals from juniors Corey Aferiat and Alex Ardolino and senior Brent Siebold.

But Swarthmore (2-5, 1-1) returned the favor by blanking the Mules in the final frame, while also scoring four goals, including the game winner with 
1:50 remaining. All three of Muhlenberg's Centennial Conference games have been decided by one goal.

Ardolino and Siebold scored two goals apiece, while junior Clint Watkins added a goal and two assists for the Mules.

A clean sweep of all six singles matches helped the Muhlenberg women's tennis team breeze past its Lehigh Valley rival, Moravian, 8-1.



The win clinched Muhlenberg (4-2) a tie with the Greyhounds (5-4) for the Matte Award, which goes to the school with the better head-to-head record in 
all sports. The Mules currently lead the competition, 8-3, with five sports remaining (softball, men's golf, men's tennis and men's and women's track and field).

A pair of freshmen, Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman got Muhlenberg going by winning 8-0 at No. 3 doubles. The No. 2 doubles team of seniors 
Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt also won, 8-4, to give the Mules a 2-1 lead heading into singles.

Winston, Schmidt and Szulman all picked up impressive wins at Nos. 4, 5 and 6 singles, respectively. Winston did not drop a game in her straight sets win, 
while Schmidt and Szulman combined to drop just three total games as they both won easily.

Sanders, meanwhile, needed a 7-1 tiebreaker to win the first set before finishing her Greyhound opponent off, 6-1, in the second set.

The most competitive match of the day came at No. 2 singles where senior Sara Sutker (right) dropped the first set, 6-2, before rebounding with a 6-4 win in the second. She carried that momentum to a 10-2 win in the third-set supertiebreaker for her team-high fifth win of the spring.

Senior Caitie Druker was leading 6-2, 6-5 at No. 1 singles when her opponent retired.

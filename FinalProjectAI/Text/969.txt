Philosophy & Mission
âMedicineâ¦is at its heart a human endeavor, requiring good science but also a limitless curiosity and interest in your fellow human being.â â Abraham Verghese, MD
Muhlenberg has long been known for preparing excellent students for a challenging career in medicine. Medical schools are increasingly emphasizing the need for broadly trained students. Itâs no longer enough to just be good at science and math. To develop into a leading physician, one needs to be knowledgeable about a wide range of human expression, diversity and experience. This includes experience in disciplinary areas such as religion, philosophy, sociology, psychology, history and the arts.
As a liberal arts college with a tradition of inter-disciplinary study, Muhlenberg College students are well positioned to develop the habits of mind that medical schools desire.
The Shankweiler Scholars program is organized with this mission in mind. Through dedicated seminars, a public lecture series and an interdisciplinary self-designed curriculum, we provide an excellent framework for studying medicine as a human endeavor.

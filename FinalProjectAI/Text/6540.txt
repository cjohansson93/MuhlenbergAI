Freshman Reaches Final at ITA Tournament
 Sunday, September 30, 2012







					 



Freshman Dylan Ander of the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team reached the final of the B6 singles draw at the ITA Southeast Regional, hosted by
Mary Washington.

After two relatively comfortable wins against opponents from Randolph-Macon and Roanoke in the first two rounds, Ander (left) needed three sets to beat a Salisbury player
in a semifinal match. He won the first set in the final, but his opponent from York won the second set in a tiebreak and took the third.

All eight Mules who competed in the tournament won at least one match. Ander’s doubles partner, freshman Neil Shulman, advanced to the 
semifinals in the B8 singles draw. 

In doubles, the top two Muhlenberg teams both went 2-2, falling in consolation finals. In the B1 draw, freshman Max Blumenthal and junior Jason
Teitelbaum won a pair of thrillers, 8-6 and 9-8 (7-1). Sophomores Daniel Lakhman and Eric Chavis finished fourth in the B2 draw.

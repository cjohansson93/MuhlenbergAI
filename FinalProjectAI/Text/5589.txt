tennis teams tame terror


The Muhlenberg men’s and women’s tennis teams apparently believe traditions should be preserved and continued their historical dominance over McDaniel, posting two 8-1 victories. 

The women have won nine straight against the Green Terror, while the men hold an even

longer winning streak – 25 consecutive defeats of their Centennial Conference rivals.

Senior Jacquelyn Magner turned in an impeccable performance on the women’s team’s Senior Day as she snuffed out the opposition in both her singles and doubles matches.

The Wilton, Conn., native, claimed a 6-0, 6-0 victory at No. 5 singles – one of four singles matches in which the Mules (5-2, 5-1) didn’t surrender a game – 
after sweeping the No. 2 doubles match along with junior Carly Rotfeld.

Freshmen Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt also recorded an 8-0 shutout in their first collegiate match at No. 1 doubles.

The triumph was sealed by senior Amanda Clifford, who recorded a victory in her first CC match of the season, as she won 8-2 at No. 6 singles.

Muhlenberg extended its winning streak to four contests and now has a total of five victories in the conference, equaling their last season’s total midway through the campaign.

The men’s team claimed an identical win against McDaniel, clinching wins in all three doubles matches and losing only one singles contest to run its winning streak to three.

With a 6-3 overall record, Muhlenberg now has its most wins in a season since the 2003 squad finished 9-2.

Senior Jamie Goldman conceded the fewest games of the three Mules who won their singles and doubles encounters. He came out victorious at 
No. 4 singles (6-1, 6-0) and No. 3 doubles together with freshman Wayne Mitchel (8-0). Sophomore Matt Kral and junior Brian Wernick also went undefeated on the day.

After missing Thursday’s encounter with Moravian, sophomore Robbie Goldwein returned to Muhlenberg’s starting lineup earning a 6-3, 6-4 win at No. 1 singles.

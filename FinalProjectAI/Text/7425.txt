The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team broke into the win column with an 8-1 defeat of Arcadia in its home opener.

For the second straight year, junior No. 1 Daniel Lakhman was nearly perfect against the Knights, dropping only one game in his singles and
doubles matches. He posted a 6-0, 6-0 shutout in singles play.

Lakhman’s doubles partner, senior Jason Teitelbaum (pictured) wasn’t too far off, winning 6-1, 6-2 at No. 2 singles.

Senior Ben Berkowitz and sophomore Derrick Eng also went 2-0 on the day after teaming up for an 8-5 win at third doubles.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team picked up its first win of the year in thrilling fashion, coming from behind to defeat regionally ranked Elizabethtown.


The Blue Jays, who are ranked 14th in the Atlantic South Region, took a 2-1 lead after doubles, but the Mules captured four of the six singles matches (four of
which went to three sets) to complete the 5-4 win.

Junior Sharen Resnikoff (pictured) won the clincher, outlasting her No. 5 singles opponent, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3, to give Muhlenberg a
5-3 lead with one match still on the court.

Senior Emily Szulman was the lone Muhlenberg player to win at both singles and doubles. Like Resnikoff, she came back after dropping her first
set at No. 3 singles to win in three.

Freshman Sara Finger (No. 2) and junior Jennifer Goldberg (No. 4) both won in straight sets.

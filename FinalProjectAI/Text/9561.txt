Muhlenberg College Board Chair Richard C. Crist Jr. â77 Pâ05 Pâ09 recently announced that the Collegeâs Board of Trustees had formalized Kathleen Harringâs role as interim president with a two-year agreement.
Crist writes, âWe are very fortunate that [Harring] is willing to serve the college in this important leadership role. In addition, we have a strong, experienced senior staff capable of leading their areas of responsibility in a collaborative and inclusive manner. The Board is pleased with the effective and intelligent approach to leading the college this semester.â 
âThe Board had tremendous confidence in [Interim President] Harring's ability to lead when she was appointed in June,â he added. âThe early months of her presidency have only served to strengthen our confidence.â
The email from Crist says the two-year agreement provides the opportunity for Harring to continue progress on the Collegeâs strategic plan. He added that her steady and effective leadership enables the board to conduct a presidential search at a time of its choosing rather than rushing into the process.
A member of the Muhlenberg College faculty since 1984, Harring has served in a number of leadership roles at Muhlenberg, most recently as the Collegeâs provost. During her tenure as provost, Harring was instrumental in guiding a number of important initiatives, including serving as co-chair for Muhlenbergâs 2017 strategic planning process, implementing procedures to support the Collegeâs diversity initiatives and overseeing planning for new post-graduate programs.

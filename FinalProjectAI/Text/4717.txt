Womens tennis wins finale





The Muhlenberg womens tennis team brought its season to an end with a victory over a team that will host its conference tournament and came in winners of five out of six.

The Mules topped Elizabethtown, which will be the top seed in the Commonwealth Conference playoffs, 6-3, winning at first and second doubles and first through fourth singles. Muhlenberg finishes its 2010 season at 7-8 and riding a four-match winning streak, while the Blue Jays dropped to 13-4.

Juniors Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt cruised to an 8-1 victory at No. 2 doubles over a team that had won eight of its previous nine matches. Classmates Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker added an 8-4 victory at No. 1 over a pairing that had been similarly hot (seven of nine).

In singles action, Druker and Sutker posted identical 6-1, 6-2 wins at first and second.

Winston and Schmidt (right) both battled through tough first sets before breezing in the second. Winston took her first set 7-5 and the second 6-1 at No. 3. At No. 4, Schmidt went into a first-set tiebreak, winning 10-8, and then rolled to a 6-2 victory in the second.

All of Elizabethtowns singles players and doubles pairings had winning records entering the dual match.

The four captains victories in singles allowed them all to finish the season at .500 or better individually.

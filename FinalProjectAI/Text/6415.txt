Being three outs away from a win was like an April Fools joke for the Muhlenberg softball team.




In both ends of its makeup Centennial Conference doubleheader at Gettysburg, the Mules took a sizable lead into the bottom of the seventh. The Bullets won the first game and nearly pulled off another incredible comeback in the second, but Muhlenberg held on for the split.

 The wild games (a 9-8 loss and a 7-6 win) left the Mules with a 4-2 CC record in their stretch of three doubleheaders – two on the road – in six days.



Behind the hot hitting of sophomore Kelly Kline, Muhlenberg (9-11, 4-2) built an 8-2 lead in the opener. Kline went 4-for-5 and had RBI hits in her first three at-bats. The Mules scored in five of the seven innings, with senior Brittany Blohm and sophomores Erica Wenzel and Colleen O’Donnell all contributing to the 16-hit attack with three hits apiece.

Held to six hits in the first six innings, Gettysburg (11-8, 3-1) erupted in the seventh, with seven of the first eight batters getting hits.  The game was tied with runners on second and third and two outs when the Bullet leadoff hitter beat out a slow roller as the winning run crossed.

Muhlenberg wasted no time shaking off the tough loss, scoring two runs in the first inning of Game 2 and adding three more in the second inning. Kline had a two-run single in the second and added an RBI hit in the fourth for her sixth RBI of the day.

Sophomore Chelsea Benjamin (left) also drove in three runs, the last on a single in the fourth that gave the Mules a 7-0 lead. Freshman Alyssa Schell went 3-for-5 and scored three runs, and O’Donnell also crossed home plate three times.

It was barely enough. Gettysburg scored twice in the sixth and added two more in the seventh to make it 7-4. With the tying run up and one out, freshman Heather Porrini came on in relief. After a flyout, an infield error brought in two runs to cut the lead to one. But Porrini got the final out on a line drive to second to earn her first save and finally enable the Mule and their fans to exhale.

softball returns to action with sweep


A 10-day layoff for a hot team can be a bad thing, but it didn’t seem to bother the Muhlenberg softball team one bit.

Playing for the first time 



Sophomore Jess Kasza drove in three runs with a double, single and sacrifice fly in the second game.



following three consecutive rainouts, the Mules moved closer to their first Centennial Conference playoff berth since 2004 with a doubleheader sweep at McDaniel, 9-0 and 11-0. 

Muhlenberg (16-11, 10-2) is in sole possession of first place in the CC but faces the second- and third-place teams, Ursinus and Haverford, in its two remaining doubleheaders, beginning tomorrow at Haverford.

The 20 runs were the most scored by the Mules in a twinbill since they plated 22 against Franklin & Marshall in 2006. They hadn’t scored 20 runs while winning both ends of a doubleheader by shutout since 1996 (8-0 and 15-0 against Swarthmore).

Sophomores Ashley Brewer and Alyssa Bruckner combined to hold the Green Terror (11-13, 2-6) to seven hits, with Brewer tossing a two-hitter for her fifth shutout of the season in the opener. She also went 4-for-4 in the game. 

Muhlenberg scored in bunches, plating multiple runs in seven of 13 innings. 

In the opener, the Mules scored two in the first, three in the second and two in the third. Senior Samantha Crist knocked in a run in the first with a two-out single, and back-to-back doubles by Brewer and senior RiRi Ferrigno brought in the third-inning runs. Crist stole home in the third.

Muhlenberg added two runs in the sixth, ending a game early via the eight-run rule for the first time this season.

Ferrigno had three hits and three RBI in the game and added three more hits with two RBI – on a two-out, two-run single in the third – in the nightcap. 

Freshmen Maggie Scarpelli and Brittany Blohm also hit two-run singles in the second game as the Mules rolled up 14 hits. Scarpelli finished 3-for-3 with three RBI.

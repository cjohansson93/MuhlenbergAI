NCAA Preview

football to reunite with wesley


Just as no one player makes a championship team, no one play makes a championship season. But if you had to pick one play that is most responsible for the Muhlenberg football team winning a share of the Centennial Conference title, it came from a most unlikely hero.

By earning the CC's automatic qualifier to the NCAA Tournament, the Mules get to extend their season at least another week. They travel to Dover, Del., to take on Wesley, ranked third in Division III in two polls and the top overall seed in the NCAAs, on Saturday.

Muhlenberg might not have made it there if not for a play by senior reserve tight end Drew Brantner back on September 25, in the

team's second CC game. The Mules had a 27-24 lead when they lined up to punt from the Gettysburg 44 with less than 50 seconds remaining. The snap went way over the punter's head, and when he tried to recover the ball, he fumbled it at the Muhlenberg 14.

The Bullets' Anthony DeSalva picked up the fumble and appeared to be headed for the end zone and an almost-certain Gettysburg miracle win. But Brantner ran him down and tackled him at the 7.

"I was just put in there as a sub," recalled Brantner. "I remember a lot of cheering coming from their sideline. I just chased him down as fast as I could. I was happy to be in the right spot to get him. It gave our defense a chance to be out there, and we're confident that our defense will get stops."

The defense did stop the potent Gettysburg offense on three downs, forcing a game-tying field goal. Then the defense came up big again in overtime, with Shane O'Connor picking off a pass. Then the offense came through, as Dan Deighan hit Isaiah Vaughn with a 25-yard game-winning touchdown pass on the Mules' first offensive play of overtime.

Muhlenberg won at defending CC champion Johns Hopkins the following

week and, despite a couple of bumps in the road, went on to its seventh CC crown in the last 10 years. Might it have been different had Gettysburg pinned a devastating loss on the Mules?

"It's hard to say," said Brantner. "When we do have a loss we come out more focused and get better the next week."

That is the position Muhlenberg finds itself in as it prepares for its eighth NCAA Tournament game. After dropping a 14-13 decision to Moravian in the final game of the regular season, the Mules turn their attention to a formidable Wesley team. The 9-0 Wolverines have outscored their opponents by an average margin of 43-12 and rank in the top 20 in Division III in 11 categories - including total defense, in which they are first.

Wesley has played two close games against other NCAA Tournament teams, beating Delaware Valley 21-17 and Salisbury 17-14, but its other seven games have all been decided by at least 21 points.

"We realize we're playing against a very good opponent," said Brantner. "There's an even higher level of focus."

Muhlenberg has seen Wesley plenty of times before. In 2007, the teams met in the 

second round of the NCAA Tournament at Wesley. The Mules led 7-0 before the Wolverines scored on a touchdown pass with 1:19 left in the half, and Wesley pulled away in the second half for a 38-21 win.

The next year, Wesley visited Muhlenberg for a first-round game, and again the Mules hung tough in the first half. A dropped pass in the end zone and missed field goal prevented Muhlenberg from taking an early lead. The Wolverines put the first points on the board on a touchdown with 2:49 left in the first half, then scored another one on a Hail Mary pass on the last play of the half. The 20-0 final marks the only time the Mules have been shut out in their last 137 games.

Wesley came back to Allentown for a preseason scrimmage in 2009, and Muhlenberg returned the

favor before the start of this season. According to Brantner, that familiarity is a good thing.

"We know what they're about, and we know they can be blocked and tackled just like anyone else," he said. "Having been on the field with them, it helps our coaches to prepare for the game."

If there is one chink in the Wolverines' armor, it is turnovers. They are minus-3 in turnover margin, whereas Muhlenberg is plus-7.  The Mules recovered three fumbles in the teams' 2007 NCAA meeting and will likely need to capitalize on Wesley mistakes if they are to advance to the second round against the winner of the game between Hampden-Sydney and Montclair State.

Regardless of what happens at Wesley, this has been an extraordinary turnaround season for the Mules, who flipped their record from 3-7 to 7-3 with a sophomore quarterback and previously inexperienced players at other key positions.

"There's a high level of talent on this team," noted Brantner. "It doesn't matter what class year they are - they play with a certain level of confidence that makes them seem older than they might be. And we also bring a good mindset to practice every day. When we come ready to practice, it shows on Saturday."

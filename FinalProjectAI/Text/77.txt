A Musical Staged Reading
May 7, 2022in the Recital Hall,Baker Center for the Arts
Book and lyrics by Gabriel Jason Dean & Jessie DeanMusic and additional lyrics by David Dabbon
Directed by Jessie Dean, Troy Dwyer, Lauren Koranda & Elizabeth MurielMusical Director: Abigail Sherman
 In the aftermath of the deadliest shooting on a college campus in U.S. history, surviving cast members of Thornton Wilderâs Our Town put together an unauthorized show as a way to reclaim their theatre space and heal their broken community. But when the event is stopped mid-performance, the cast and audience must decide between compliance and defiance. A hyper-theatrical blend of truth with fiction, of scene with song, Our New Town is an immersive musical that puts the audience at the center of an American crisis.

Quinn was celebrated as one of the breakout comics of the eighties. In 1987, he began a three-year stint at MTV, hosting the popular shows "Remote Control" and "Colin Quinn's Manly World." In the early 90's he moved to the A&E network’s "Caroline's Comedy Hour," a weekly program that showcased up and coming as well as popular stand-up comics.
In 1995, he was hired as a writer and feature player for NBC’s acclaimed “Saturday Night Live,” and in 1998, he succeeded Norm MacDonald as the new Weekend Update anchor, a position which he held until 2000.
In recent years, Muhlenberg has hosted other standout comedic acts, including Dave Coulier, Dave Chapell, Jay Mohr, Jimmy Fallen and Norm McDonald.

Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a department within the Controller’s Office. It is the responsibility of this department to review expenditures and disburse college funds in accordance with Muhlenberg College policies and procedures. It is expected that all employees behave in a fiscally responsible manner in conducting college business.
Accounts payable checks are issued for approved college expenditures. The Purchasing Department should be contacted regarding the procurement/purchasing process. College purchases for goods require a purchase order. If services are procured, a contract needs to be in place. The Purchasing Department can assist you with these procedures. Reimbursements for travel and conference expenses and cash advances are also processed through accounts payable. All payment documents for service contracts or consultant services must include a federal identification number in order to comply with federal reporting requirements.

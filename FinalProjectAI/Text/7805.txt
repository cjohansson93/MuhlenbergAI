The Muhlenberg field hockey team dropped its first Centennial Conference game of the season, 2-1 at McDaniel.

The Mules, who had their four-game winning streak snapped, dominated possession in the first half but could not score.
McDaniel (5-2) took advantage of one of its few chances, scoring on a breakaway.

The Green Terror scored again early in the second half to extend the lead to 2-0. 

Muhlenberg (4-2) cut the deficit in half when freshman Alyssa Scott scored her first career goal 
off a penalty corner with 14:16 remaining. 
Senior Samantha Swire (left) assisted on the goal. It was her team-leading fifth assist of the season.

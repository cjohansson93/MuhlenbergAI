Tips:


Be Proactive: Engage students early on, pay attentions to warning signs of distress, and set limits on disruptive behaviors


Listen Sensitively and Carefully: Use a calm and sincere voice. Avoid using any threatening, humiliating, and intimidating responses.


Safety First: The welfare of the campus community is top priority. When an individual is displaying threatening or potentially violent behavior call for help


Follow Through: If providing a resource offer to direct the student to the physical location.


Consultation and Documentations: Always document your interactions with distressed students and consult with your department chair/supervisor after any incident

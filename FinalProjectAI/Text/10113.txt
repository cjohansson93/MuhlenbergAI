Transcripts
The transcript is the complete and unabridged record of all academic work attempted or credited at Muhlenberg College, regardless of whether the student was enrolled in undergraduate or graduate courses, as a degree-seeking student, or a non-degree student. Muhlenberg does not provide official transcripts which segregate individual courses, schools, or terms or reflects only study at one level. 
Official transcripts bear the College seal and the Registrar's signature and are provided directly to individuals, schools, or organizations with a signed release of the student.
As part of the online ordering process, you can ask to have the transcript delayed until the current term's grades or degrees are posted to the record.
The National Student Clearinghouse, our transcript service provider, recommends use of Chrome (PC) or Safari (Mac) web browser for an optimal ordering experience. Be sure to check your information as you enter it; incorrect information, such as a misspelled email address or a single-digit error on a birth date, SSN, or ID, can result in delays due to required research on our part to verify the record prior to processing.
The Registrar does not provide unofficial transcripts or other unofficial documents. Current students who want a simple listing of their Academic Course History should use that link in Workday. Former students and graduates only have access to an official transcript.
Procedure for Requesting a Transcript
Muhlenberg College complies with all federal regulations regarding the release of education records as established by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. All requests to release information from academic records must include a studentâs legal signature or approval.
Students must request a transcript using the web service of the National Student Clearinghouse, at https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/select. You can place as many orders as you like in one session using any major credit card.  Your card will only be charged after your order has been completed.  Updates on the status of your order updates will be emailed to you by the system.  You can also track your order online using your email address and order number.  Your signed consent may be required to fulfill your transcript order.  For your convenience, a consent form will be generated for your order that you can return via fax, mail, or as a scanned email attachment.  Click on the Order Transcripts Online link to access the ordering site.
The student is the only person who can authorize the release of information of the academic record. No one else has the legal right to order a transcript.

Men’s Tennis Falls to Dickinson


The playoff hopes of the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team took a blow with a 6-3 home loss to Dickinson.

The Mules (4-8, 2-5) had a strong chance to make the Centennial Conference playoffs for the first time with wins in two of their final three matches. Muhlenberg
hosts regionally ranked Franklin & Marshall tomorrow before finishing up the regular season at Ursinus on Saturday.

Junior Jason Teitelbaum and sophomore Eric Chavis teamed up to win at No. 2 doubles. The top two players in the Mule
singles lineup, sophomore Daniel Lakhman and freshman Max Blumenthal, each won in straight sets.

Rheiner's 28 goals this season are tied for the third-most in team history.



The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team faced a tough assignment in its last home game of the season: two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Dickinson,
ranked No. 2 in Division III.

The Red Devils (14-0, 7-0) scored three goals in the first 4:04, led 5-0 early in the second quarter and remained comfortably ahead the rest of the game, winning 15-9.

Despite the loss, the Mules (6-8, 2-5) had some noteworthy accomplishments.

Senior Doug Rheiner scored three goals to tie the school record of seven hat tricks in a season, 
and senior Jack Reilly scored a career-high four goals to run his season total to 22. That gave Muhlenberg four 20-goal scorers (Rheiner with 28,
sophomore Jon Thomas with 27, Reilly with 22 and sophomore Jason Mertz with 21) for the first time in program history. The Mules
are the only team in the CC with four 20-goal scorers.

Reilly (39 points), Rheiner (38) and Thomas (36) will all take aim at the school record for points in a season (42) in Saturday’s finale at Ursinus.

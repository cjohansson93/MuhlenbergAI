We ensure our building environments and grounds include energy planning efforts that conserve natural resources and implement sustainable practices.















Renewable Energy



Muhlenberg recently entered into a historic project to collectively purchase solar energy with three other Pennsylvania colleges. Along with other on-campus renewable energy initiatives, this project allows the College to have a carbon-neutral electricity footprint for the first time.

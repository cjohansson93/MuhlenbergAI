âBerg Hosts Ten Thousand Villages Fair Trade Festival Sale



Muhlenberg College will once again host the annual Ten Thousand Villages Fair Trade Festival Sale on December 1 and 2, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.  


	 Wednesday, November 17, 2010  11:45 AM

The sale will be held in the campus student center, Seegers Union, rooms 108-110.  Students in the class “Marketing in Not-For-Profits” coordinate the entire event.
Ten Thousand Villages is a non-profit organization that provides vital, fair income to artisans from developing nations by marketing their hand-made crafts in North America.
Fair trade means paying the artisans a fair wage.  By working with these artisans, Ten Thousand Villages brings the culture and crafts of the artisans to North Americans while enabling the artisans to support themselves and their families.  In the past five years, Muhlenberg College’s festival sale generated more than $90,000 for Ten Thousand Villages.
The festival sale will showcase authentic, charming gifts and home décor handcrafted by skilled artisans from more than 30 countries around the world.  The merchandise ranges from folk art to ceramics and from textiles to baskets for the home.  Additionally, customers will find jewelry, scarves, holiday ornaments, and musical instruments.  All merchandise will make excellent holiday gifts for friends and family in addition to supporting deserving people from all over the globe.

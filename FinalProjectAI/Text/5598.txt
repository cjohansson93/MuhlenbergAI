Mules perform well at first outdoor meet


Losing a sneaker during an intercollegiate run might spoil your chances of winning a race, but junior 
David Chorney doesn’t think so. 
The Bristol, N.H., native lost his sneaker during the first lap of the 5000m run, took a break two laps later to put it back on and still came out victorious with a 12-second advantage over the second-place athlete Saturday at the Millersville Invite. Besides, his time was fast enough to guarantee him a spot at the ECAC Championships.
Chorney secured one of eight victories for the Muhlenberg men’s track and field team, which placed second with 155 points in the opening meet of the outdoor season. Host Millersville University finished first, collecting a total of 184 points. 
Sophomore Brendan Kirk won the 110m hurdles, setting a personal record with 16.05, and the 400m hurdles in ECAC-qualifying time of 56.36. He was also member of the victorious 4x400m relay along with freshman Bobby Torphy, sophomore Bill Ryan and sophomore Patrick Thornton. 




Sophomore Caitlin Heffern was a runner-up in the javelin throw with a toss of 110-11.


Thornton was a first-place finisher in the 800m run with a time of 1:58.71.
Junior Timothy Van Syckle won the 1500m, while sophomore Jeremiah Lachaud placed first in the 200m dash (22.84) and qualified for ECACs in the 100m dash (11.14), finishing third.   
Senior Adam Carter steamrolled the high jump, clearing a height of 5-10¾, and took the runner-up spot in the 110m hurdles with personal-best 16.58.
The women’s Mule team also came back with a number of respectable finishes, placing third with 110 points behind Millersville University with 210.5 and Lebanon Valley College with 126.5.
The 4x100m relay composed of freshman Lindsay Weidmann, junior Amanda Martini, senior 
Emily Karel and sophomore Alex Faust ran to a first-place finish with ECAC-qualifying time of 52.40. 
Faust qualified individually for ECACs in the pole vault with 10-6 as she took second spot.
Sophomore Lauren Conicella turned in a first-place performance in the 1500m, improving her personal best to 5:07.98. Conicella also helped the Muhlenebrg 4x400m to a second-place finish along with Karel, Martini and Faust.
Junior Lucy Brock claimed the third triumph on the day for the women’s team as she won the 100m hurdles, finishing in 17.44.

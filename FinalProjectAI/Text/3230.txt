Two Soccer Players Honored for Academics


Two Muhlenberg soccer players were voted to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division second team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America.
 
District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.30 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team.

Junior Christina O’Grady of the women’s team earned Academic All-District honors for the second year in a row. A double major in accounting and finance, O’Grady is fourth on the 10-4-3 Mules with 11 points on four goals and three assists. She ranks 11th in program history with 39 career points.

Senior Billy Dalton of the men’s team received the honor for the first time. A double major in business administration and finance, Dalton is in his third year as team captain. The central midfielder has scored a team-leading 16 points in 2008 and has an even 40 points (14 goals, 12 assists) for his career. 





The Muhlenberg football team is first in the South in the first NCAA regional rankings of the 2008 season.

These rankings are conducted by the NCAA Division III Football Committee, the same group that ultimately determines selections and seeding for the NCAA Tournament. The
top seed in the region at the end of the season can serve as the host for at least three rounds of the NCAAs, as long as it keeps winning.

In the national poll, which have no bearing on the postseason, the Mules (7-0) are ranked second by the American Football Coaches Association and fourth by D3Football.com.

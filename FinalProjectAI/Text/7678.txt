Men's Soccer Stays Undefeated with Hard-Fought Win
 Saturday, September 20, 2014 - page 4







					 







After going undefeated in nonconference play, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team opened up Centennial Conference play at home against the McDaniel Green Terror. Heading into the conference showdown, the Mules had only given up one goal, which came in the first game of the season. 



Their 429-minute shutout streak and undefeated run would not end.

The Mules walked away with a hard fought 1-0 decision to improve to 5-0-1 on the season – only the third time they’ve been undefeated through six games in the last 20 years. The hype, intensity, and competitiveness that is expected in Centennial play was met and exceeded in a game that could fittingly be described as a battle from start to finish.

Sophomore Nick Sarkos (left) netted his second goal of the season off senior Joe Adams’ throwin, which was launched into the box and flicked by senior Lance Dotzman, early in the second half giving the Mules a 1-0 advantage. Muhlenberg would not look back as McDaniel could not crack the Mules’ defense.
(corrected 9/24)
McDaniel managed to get off nine shots in the match with only one being on goal. Senior Danny Pinto handled the lone shot on target on his way to recording his fifth straight shutout.

“We stepped up to the challenge today,” said Adams, a starting back. “We matched McDaniel’s physicality from the first minute to the last.”

Muhlenberg was able to stifle the Green Terror surge that came late in the game. “We did what we needed to do. We protected our home turf,” Adams said. 

The Mules get a short break from conference play as they look to remain undefeated and extend their scoreless streak when neighboring DeSales visits on Wednesday before travelling to Gettysburg on Saturday in their first road game of the season.

“We’re excited about the games we have ahead of us,” Adams continued. “Each game is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves. We’re happy with the results we’ve gotten but now we’re just focused on DeSales and taking it one game at a time.”

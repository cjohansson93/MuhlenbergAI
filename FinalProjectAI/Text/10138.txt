Baccalaureate is an interfaith candle lighting service that occurs the week of Commencement for Muhlenberg students. In addition to readings and music offered by members of the class, President Harring provides remarks at the gathering, and several seniors offer reflections. The ceremony lasts about one hour.
This year's Baccalaureate ceremony will be limited to graduating seniors. It will be held prior to Champagne Brunch on Friday, May 20, 2022. Additional details will be shared in the Spring 2022 semester.

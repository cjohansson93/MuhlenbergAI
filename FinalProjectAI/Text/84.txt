Rosy-Crimson
Rosy-Crimson uses repeated language taken from multiple English translations of Homer's The Odyssey as the foundation for non-linear performance. The reassembled language centers around the phrase âdawnâs rosy fingers.â Exploiting the differences across translation, an ensemble of performers experiment with volume, pitch, pace, intensity, silence, and movement as conduits of meaning. Rosy-Crimson will be presented at sunset, a reciprocal to dawnâs central role.

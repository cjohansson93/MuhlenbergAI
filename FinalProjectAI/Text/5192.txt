Women’s lacrosse clinches playoff berth


In honor of the Plain White T’s concert tomorrow night at Memorial Hall, here are 1,2,3,4 things about the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team:

1 more game (at least). The Mules clinched a Centennial Conference 



Morrongiello’s goal with 15:44 left in the first half tied the game at 2-2.



playoff berth with a 16-12 win against Washington in their last game of the regular season.
2 consecutive playoff berths. The Mules (10-3, 6-3) had never been to the CC playoffs before last year.
3 seed in the CC playoffs. Muhlenberg will play the loser of next Tuesday’s game between Gettysburg and Franklin & Marshall at the site of the winner in a semifinal match next Saturday.
4 was the previous record for fewest CC losses. The Mules’ 6-3 mark was their best ever.

And none of those things would have been possible without 5: the five seniors (Marguerite Farrell, Sara 

Hiller, Farrin Jay, Ruth Morrongiello and Megan Wilson), who were honored before the game and could celebrate their 40th win as a class (the most for any class in program history) after it.

“Simply, we would not be where we are without them,” said 



Jay made her sixth career start against Washington.



junior Amanda McGovern. “They’re involved in everything, and they’re pushing us all the time. They’re all great leaders in their own way, on and off the field.”

Muhlenberg took a little while to get going against an opponent that was looking to close the season with three straight wins after starting out 0-6 in the CC. The Shorewomen (7-8, 2-7) led 4-3 with nine minutes left in the first half. Junior Danielle Scarrone tied the score with her 11th goal of the season, and with 6:50 showing on the clock McGovern gave the Mules the lead for good by netting her 100th career goal.

“It’s a nice achievement to have but I would not have gotten it without my teammates,” she said. “I see it as more of a team achievement.”

The ninth Muhlenberg player to reach the century mark, 

McGovern – and her teammates – kept on achieving. Junior Alyssa Bascelli converted a pass from Hiller 24 seconds after McGovern’s milestone goal to make it 6-4. 

After Washington scored to close the margin to one, the Mules scored twice in nine seconds to open up a three-goal lead, which they carried into halftime. Freshman Mary Ann Collins found cutting sophomore Danielle Rosen in front of the cage for the first goal, and McGovern won the ensuing draw and went right to goal for her third score of the game.

McGovern added her fourth goal in the first minute of the second half, and the Mules kept the Shorewomen at arm’s length the rest of the game, never letting the spread slip below three.

After nearly getting shut out in the second half of last Saturday’s win against Swarthmore and losing at Ursinus on Wednesday, Muhlenberg returned to form just at the right time.

“We were in a little slump, but we realized what was at stake and how good we can be. We knew we had to come out strong and finish off another tough game.”

McGovern and Rosen finished with four goals apiece – the sixth time this season both have recorded hat tricks. Sophomore Christine Van Hise scored two goals for the first time in her career, and sophomore Lauren DeCarle recorded six ground balls and four draw controls.

Two of the five seniors reached milestones in the win. Hiller notched two goals and an assist to reach the 150-point mark for her career. Morrongiello scored a goal and had six draw controls, breaking the school record of 59 in a season she set last year.

another record for faust


Make it two days, two records for junior Alex Faust of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team. After breaking her own school record in the pole vault
on the first day of the Bucknell Outdoor Classic, Faust etched her name into the record book one more time on the second day.

Faust ran the 400 meters in 57.97 seconds, placing sixth and topping the old school mark of 58.37 by almost a half-second. She now owns seven school records (all individual,
none in relays) indoors and outdoors. 

Faust also anchored the 4x100 relay team and led off the 4x400 team, both of which qualified for ECACs. The 4x400 quarter, which also included junior Janelle Mentrikoski
and freshmen Kimberlee Yalango and Jenna Schaffer, placed eighth.

Schaffer ran the 100 meters in 12.95, setting a personal best.

The men’s team also had an ECAC-qualifying performance from a relay team: The 4x100 (juniors Brendan Kirk, William Ryan and Jeremiah Lachaud
along with freshman Peter Rice) ran a 43.98, improving their season-best time on one one-hundredth of a second.

Brewer's sacrifice fly drove in the first of two Muhlenberg runs in the first inning of Game 2. The score remained 2-0 until Neumann broke through for four runs in the bottom of the fifth.

Junior Brittany Blohm hit her first home run of the season in the sixth, but the Knights got the run back in the bottom of the inning to take a 5-3 lead into the last inning.

Barber led off the seventh by drawing a walk and went to second on a single by freshman Erica Wenzel. One out later, freshman Kelly Kline singled in a run, and the next batter, senior Jess Kasza, doubled to bring in Wenzel and Kline with the tying and go-ahead runs.

The would-be dramatic win for Muhlenberg turned into a dramatic win for Neumann in the bottom of the seventh.

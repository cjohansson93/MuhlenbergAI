Torphy wins prestigious academic award





Junior Bobby Torphy of the Muhlenberg track and field team was named an NCAA Elite 88 award winner last night at a banquet at the 
Division III Indoor Championships at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana.

The Elite 88 award was instituted this fall and is presented 



to the student-athlete with the highest grade-point average competing at the 
finals site of each of the NCAAs 88 championships. 

A biochemistry major, Torphy (left) has excelled in the classroom in his time at Muhlenberg. He was selected to the Academic All-America 
third team last year and has been named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll each of the last two years.

Torphy has also proven himself an elite athlete. He is making his third trip to a national meet and has already placed once before. Last year 
he ran with the distance medley relay team that earned All-America honors, making him just the fourth Mule athlete in any sport to earn All-America and Academic All-America honors in the same year. 

He also competed in the cross country championships this fall, beating more than 100 runners at the meet.

At the NCAA meet, Torphy placed fifth in the first heat of the 800 meters. He was 10th overall, missing qualifying for the final by two places. The
other Mule athlete to compete on the first day of the meet, senior Jennifer Lynch (right), did not qualify for the final in the mile,
coming in 13th.

womens basketball run ends





The magic finally ran out for the Muhlenberg womens basketball team.

After posting back-to-back dramatic wins to reach the Sweet 16, the Mules did not have an answer for No. 2 Amherst as the hot-shooting hosts took control early en route to a 79-60 win in the third round of the NCAA Tournament.

After the Lord Jeffs opened the game with a 9-0 run, Muhlenberg finally got on the board when senior Kelly McKeon knocked down a jumper from just beyond the foul line.

Led by McKeon, who scored 12 of her game-high 22 points in the first half, the Mules (23-6) were able 





McKeon averaged 18.6 points and shot 52.3 percent from the field in five postseason games in 2011.




to pull to within seven when senior Alexandra Berlin found freshman Erin Laney alone for an easy layup with 6:58 to play before the break.

But from there, the Lord Jeffs (29-1) closed the half 



Rice Competes at NCAA Track Meet


Muhlenberg junior Peter Rice did not qualify for the final in the 400 meters at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships in Columbus, Ohio.

Rice finished fourth in his heat with a time of 50.31. The last qualifying time was 49.94.

Although the indoor season ended one day earlier than Rice would have liked, he will have more opportunities to return to the national meet when the outdoor season begins on March 26.

with a 22-6 run to go into the locker room with a 47-24 lead.

Although the Mules actually outscored Amherst in the second half, there would be no repeat of the comeback at Rochester as the Lord Jeffs shot 50.8 percent from the floor and stayed in control the rest of the way.

We actually didnt play that bad, Mule Coach Ron Rohn said of his team that shot 43.2 percent from the field. They just played really well tonight.

While the game may not have gone as they had hoped, the Mule faithful that made the long trip to Massachusetts waited after the game to give every player as standing ovation as they came out of the locker room.

The cheers were especially loud for seniors Berlin, McKeon and Sheila Cook, who all received big hugs from Rohn.

Berlin, who transferred to Muhlenberg before her junior season, scored 334 points during her two years as a Mule.

McKeon closed out her career in the top five in school history in assists (453, first), points (1,237, fifth) and rebounds (763, fifth).

Cook, who was hampered by injuries for the first half of the season, finished with 12 points to bring her career total to 974, good for 10th on Muhlenbergs all-time scoring list. 

McKeon and Cook are the first class in school history to record at least 20 wins in each of their four seasons. They were also a part of Muhlenbergs only two Sweet 16 teams, and their 91 wins are the second-most in Mule history, one behind the class of 2009.

And while her career may not have ended the way she had liked, Cook left LeFrak Gym proud of what she helped the program accomplish during her four years in Allentown. 

Obviously, knowing this is the last time I will put on a Muhlenberg uniform hurts a lot, she said. But at the same time, to be able to be a part of a special group like this and say I was on the only two teams to ever go to the Sweet 16 is something I will always cherish.

This is a great group of girls, and I will never forget the incredible memories we made together.

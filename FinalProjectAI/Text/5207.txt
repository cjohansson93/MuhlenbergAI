Men’s lacrosse evens CC record at 3-3 


Even though he was the star of the game, Mike Horowitz couldn’t celebrate a 10-8 win at Dickinson the same way as most of his teammates on the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team.

On the first night of Passover, Horowitz had to turn down



Horowitz improved his save percentage to .603.



 the Italian subs offered at the team’s postgame tailgate. “I was tempted,” he joked, “but I couldn’t do it.”

During the game, Horowitz let very little pass over, under, through or by him, making 24 saves as the Mules won their third straight game, 10-8, to move back to .500 in the Centennial Conference. 

Dickinson (5-6, 1-4) had a 52-32 advantage in shots but was turned away repeatedly by Horowitz, whose two dozen saves were the most by a Muhlenberg goalie since the sport was reinstated in 2003 and the most by a CC goalie since 2005.

“I was just hugging the post, and the defense was doing a good job giving me good angles,” said Horowitz. “They inverted our midfielders a lot and our 



Fletcher leads the Mules with 10 goals this season.



shorties did a nice job.”

Horowitz was under the gun right from the start, facing 22 shots in the first 

quarter alone. He saved 10 and let two get by, but the Mules (3-6, 3-3) also scored two goals and ended the quarter tied despite a 22-6 deficit in shots.

“In the first quarter they were really attacking the goal,” said Horowitz. “The first save I made was in tight; making that first save sets you up. It lets you know you’re seeing the ball well.”

After a mostly scoreless second quarter, Muhlenberg took the lead for good on a goal by freshman Clint Watkins with 2:25 to play before halftime. Senior Nick Fletcher scored a minute later to make it 4-2.

Dickinson put one in the net in the closing seconds of the half, but it did not translate into momentum coming out of the break. The Mules netted four goals in the first 6:06 of the third quarter to extend their lead to 8-3. 

The Red Devils never got closer than two goals the rest of the game, which ended with neither team scoring in the final 11:40.

Watkins, Fletcher and freshman Corey Aferiat each scored two goals for the Mules, who have won their three games by a total of five goals and find themselves in the same position they were in last year: win their last two CC games and qualify for the playoffs.

So why is this team different from the one that opened the year 0-6? “We had a team meeting and talked about doing the little things, winning ground balls and being physical,” explained Horowitz. “We’re a scrappy team. Our freshmen are starting to play like upperclassmen and learn what college lacrosse is about. We’re figuring out how to win games instead of just staying close.”

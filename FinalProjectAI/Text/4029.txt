Brewer honored aspitcher of the week



Baseball Edged Out; Men’s Golf Falters


The Muhlenberg baseball team put up a good fight against one of the top teams in the Centennial Conference but lost 3-2 at Haverford.

The Fords (23-4, 8-2), tied for first in the CC, received votes in both Division III polls last week and are likely to be nationally ranked when the
new polls come out tonight.

Sophomore Rob Shannon held Haverford to four hits over seven innings. He was particularly effective against the bottom of the Ford
order; the three through nine hitters were only 2-for-21 with a bunt single against him. Unfortunately, the other hit was a solo home run that
broke a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the seventh.

The Mules (6-22-1, 3-7) went down in order in the eighth and ninth.

Sophomore John Muha drove in both Muhlenberg runs with a groundout and a bases-loaded walk.

Senior Ashley Brewer of the Muhlenberg softball team was named the Centennial Conference 



pitcher of the week after going 2-0 and helping the Mules rise to the top of the conference standings.

Brewers big week started with a four-hit shutout in Muhlenbergs 7-0 win at Haverford on Wednesday. She struck out seven Ford batters to pick up the 10th shutout of her career.

Then on senior day, against McDaniel, Brewer once again went the distance, allowing only five hits in the Mules 4-3 win.

Brewer finished the week with nine strikeouts and held opponents to just a .176 batting average. 

Its the third time that she has been named pitcher of the week during her career; she was also named player of the week earlier this season.

The 2010 CC player of the year, Brewer is tied for the conference lead with seven wins and ranks in the top five in both opponents batting average (4th, .226) and earned run average (5th, 1.96). Her 41 strikeouts are the ninth-best total in the conference.

After going 3-1 last week, Muhlenberg (15-10, 6-2) currently holds a half-game lead over Ursinus for first place in the CC midway through the conference season.

This semesterâs program debuts with a lecture by Jacy Reese, Co-Founder and Research Director of Sentience Institute. Reese is considered a founder of the "effective altruism" movement, encouraging people, using science and evidence, to do the most good in the world. He co-founded Sentience Institute as a think tank to research humanityâs moral circle. His new book, "The End of Animal Farming," outlines a roadmap for humanityâs upcoming transition to a world without animal slaughter.
About "The Ethics of the Anthropocene: Crisis Earth"
The earth is experiencing an era of rapid environmental change. The impact of human activity is the dominant influence on the planetâs environment and can be found in the soil, water, air and rocks. Scientists have dubbed this new geological era the Anthropocene and are scrambling to understand how these changes affect ecosystems.  
Some businesses, communities, societies and political systems are responding to this change while others are not. Are these responses, or lack thereof, ethical? Who are the winners and losers as humans face down environmental catastrophe in the era of the Anthropocene? How can we face these environmental challenges ethically? When and why do we fail? This yearâs Center for Ethics event series, The Ethics of the Anthropocene: Crisis Earth, explores the ethical implications of addressing the environmental damage that humankind has produced.
The fall 2018 semester program included visits from climatologist James Hansen, artist Peter dâAgostino, journalist Andrew Revkin, historian J.R. McNeill, marine toxicologist and author Susan Shaw and professor Mona Bahn.
All Center for Ethics events are free and open to the public.

Men's Soccer Suffers First Loss in Double OT
 Friday, October 3, 2014







					 





It took one of the top teams in Division III extra time to hand the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team its first loss
of the season.

Franklin & Marshall, ranked third by D3soccer.com and eighth by the NSCAA, scored the game’s only goal with 4:06 left in the second overtime
to defeat the Mules in a matchup of two of the 14 undefeated teams in Division III. The Mules (7-1-2, 2-1-1) came in
ranked 21st in both polls.

F&M, an NCAA quarterfinalist last year, controlled play for much of the game, even though the shots were fairly even
(14-10). Muhlenberg’s best chance to score came in the second overtime after sophomore Jack Dusing
drew a foul outside the box. A rip off the free kick went wide right.

The Diplomats (10-0-1, 4-0) took the ensuing goal kick and moved down the field for the winning goal.

Although he was credited with only two saves, including a diving stop late in regulation, senior Danny Pinto (left) had a busy
day clearing away crosses.

Muhlenberg’s nine-game unbeaten streak to start the season goes down as tied for the sixth-longest in program history.

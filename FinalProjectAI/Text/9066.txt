Markets have been celebrated by many as a positive force for democratizing a standard of living previously accessible primarily to those of noble birth. However, with progress comes a dependence on markets that risks limiting our ability to constrain them through the social and political institutions that govern economic exchange. Indeed, Adam Smith, the "father" of modern capitalism, advanced the cause of free and open markets while simultaneously warning that unfettered economic activity might hinder human moral development. The observation that markets are embedded in economic, political, social, and cultural contexts begs the question of whether markets are âfreeâ or ânatural.â The interplay of markets and morality is at the heart of the program. We will examine historical and contemporary questions about markets and accompanying moral issues they raise in regard to intellectual property, environmental sustainability, health and education, identity issues such as race and gender, and interactive media as labor. What sorts of markets create incentives for morally problematic behavior? And what markets promote virtues that bring about a harmony of interests? Does market organization of economic activity have an ethical basis, and, if so, how can that basis be used to evaluate the moral legitimacy of particular markets and market outcomes? Does the distribution of wealth that results from market activity derive its justification from the moral legitimacy of the exchange process, or is market wealth distribution a valid object of ethical inquiry in its own right? In what ways do market structures mediate political discourse, cultural evolution, and national and post-national identity?

 Why Open Access Matters to You: A Faculty Panel Wednesday, April 10 Hoffman House, 4:30-6:00 PM
Panelists will address the benefits of "open access" publishing--the growing movement to provide free and unrestricted access to scholarship via the web. The open access model promises relief for library budgets, more readers and citations for researchers, and support for longstanding scholarly principles of openness and transparency. Panelists will also address early plans for a faculty-endorsed policy on open access at the college. A panel discussion for Muhlenberg faculty and staff, led by Adam Clark, Cliff Kussmaul, Sharon Albert, Kelly Cannon, Jeff Pooley and John Sullivan.

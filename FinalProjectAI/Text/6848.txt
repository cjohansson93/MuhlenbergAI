Golf Teams Finish Second in Home Tournament

The Muhlenberg Invitational in men’s golf was rained out in the middle of October and rescheduled for late April. When the tournament was finally played (with the women’s team added), 
 it still seemed like late-fall weather.

With the sun shining but a chilly wind in the air, both Mule teams finished second at the Muhlenberg Invitational.

The men were just two strokes behind Alvernia, which had a player score a hole-in-one. It was the sixth second-place finish for the Mules at their own tournament in
the last 10 years. The team’s score of 316 was its lowest of the spring.

Junior Christopher Lucarelli (left) led Muhlenberg and tied for third with a 77, one stroke better than freshman Jonathan Graulich and 
junior Chris DiMaio. Graulich scored a birdie-two on the seventh hole.

The women competed against two other Centennial Conference opponents, finishing 18 strokes behind Franklin & Marshall and 42 strokes ahead of Ursinus.

Sophomore Christina Bryde (right) came in second, eight strokes off the lead, with a 91. She shot a birdie-two on the 13th hole. 
Freshman Kerrilynn Lanza scored a birdie on the par-4 14th hole.

 Field Hockey falls in overtime  


For more than 70 minutes, the Muhlenberg field hockey team turned away everything Susquehanna could throw at it.

The Mules, despite being outshot 25-3, held the Crusaders at bay through a scoreless regulation and into overtime thanks to some slick goalkeeping from Kristen Dornenburg and a trio of masterful defensive saves.




Courtney DeAngelis and her Mule teammates turned away 24 of Susquehanna's 25 shots.





Time after time the Crusaders were sent away goalless until they finally connected  4:32 into overtime when  Ally Bradley lofted a shot into the upper right corner of the net for the game winner.

It was the third year in a row the Mules (0-1) and Crusaders (2-0) went into an extra period in the Mule Classic. Muhlenberg beat Susquehanna 3-2 in overtime last season, while the Crusaders won in penalty strokes in 2008.

Muhlenberg's defense flustered Susquehanna, which scored 11 goals in its season opener, including stopping three shots at open nets.

Junior Brittany DeAngelis, who led the Mules with five defensive saves in 2009, got the new season started in similar fashion when she turned away a shot four minutes into the first half.

Then with less than two minutes to play in regulation, the Crusaders once again found an open net, but Devon Barber got her stick on the goal line at the very last second to momentarily save the game.

DeAngelis added her second defensive save of the day less than four minutes into overtime.

It was another tight contest for the cardiac Mules, who played in four overtime games last fall, and had 11 of their 17 games decided by one goal.

Dornenberg was solid in the cage all night, making 15 saves.

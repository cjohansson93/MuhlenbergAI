VOLLEYBALL RALLIES FOR DRAMATIC WIN


Three days before the start of the Buttermaker Tournament, named for a frog who refused to give up, the Muhlenberg volleyball team displayed that kind of persistence in its first home match of the 2007 season.

The Mules (3-2) staged two comebacks to edge defending New Jersey Athletic

Women’s Soccer Ranked in Region



The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team is 10th in the first NCAA Middle Atlantic regional rankings of the 2007 season.

The Mules opened their campaign by going 1-0-1 at Kean’s Cougar Classic, including a 3-3 tie with the host school, which is ranked eighth in the region.

Four other schools in the regional top 10 are on Muhlenberg’s schedule this season: Messiah (second) and Centennial Conference foes Johns Hopkins (third), Swarthmore (fifth) and Gettysburg (ninth).

The Mules have appeared in the regional rankings every year but one since 1998. Last season, they were 10th in the final regular-season poll.

two games, Muhlenberg found itself in a 28-24 hole late in the third game. The Mules roared back to tie the score at 29 on a combined block by sophomores Amy Cohen and Liz Dean, then won 32-30 when the Ospreys (0-3) committed a service error and attack error on back-to-back points.

Muhlenberg used the momentum of the comeback to sprint out to a 12-4 lead in Game 4, but this time it was Stockton that persisted, forcing a decisive fifth game with a 30-24 victory.

The Mules led 12-9 before the Ospreys scored the next four points. A kill by sophomore Liz Leslie tied the game back up at 13-13, but Muhlenberg’s next serve went into the net, putting Richard Stockton one point from victory.

Dean’s 11th kill of the match evened the score again. A kill by junior Megan Eiser gave the Mules a 15-14 lead, and Eiser teamed with junior Ally Ivaniski for a block to end the match.

Leslie and senior Jess Anselmi led Muhlenberg with 13 kills apiece, and Ivaniski added eight. Eiser had an outstanding all-around match, with 43 assists, 18 digs and six kills. Senior Megan Young recorded 28 digs.

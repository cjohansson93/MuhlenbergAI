Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow Carroll Bogert leads Q&A following screening


	 Wednesday, October 29, 2014  09:29 AM

Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow and Center for Ethics guest Carroll Bogert of Human Rights Watch will screen a new film entitled "E-Team" on Wednesday, October 29 at 8:00 p.m. in Seegers 113. The film, released by Netflix, was made by Academy-Award winner Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny and won the 2014 Sundance Film Festival Award for Cinematography in a U.S. Documentary. Following the film, Bogert will lead a Q and A session.  About the film: Anna, Ole, Fred and Peter are four members of the Emergencies Team - or E-Team - the most intrepid division of a respected, international human rights group (Human Rights Watch). Trained to deal with unfolding crises, the E-Team flies to hotspots all over the world as soon as allegations of human rights abuse surface. The documentary follows the E-Team members to Syria and Libya, where they uncover evidence of human rights violations. Cinematographer James Foley, who was murdered by ISIS in August 2014 contributed to the film.
For more about the film, see: http://www.eteamfilm.com/#!home/mainPage.
This event is part of the year-long Center for Ethics series, Civility and Disobedience, under the direction of Brian Mello, associate professor of political science, and Christine Sistare, professor of philosophy.
Each year, the Center for Ethics sponsors an intensive series designed to encourage discussion and reflection on a timely, pertinent topic. Center for Ethics programs are free and open to all members of the Muhlenberg campus and the local community.
Bogert’s visit to campus is a part of the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow program.  Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellows connect a liberal education with the world beyond the campus by bringing thoughtful and successful practitioners to colleges for a week of discussions with students and faculty.   Fellows are scheduled for formal presentations in classrooms, panels, and public platforms, and informal encounters at meals, in student centers, clubs, dormitories, career counseling and individual sessions. The week-long visit allows Fellows to explicate their ideas fully and often leads to continuing ties.
The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation has developed and conducted programs in higher education since 1945. More than 200 colleges have participated in the Visiting Fellows program since 1973. Dr. Lynda Yankaskas, assistant professor of history, is the chair of the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow Committee.

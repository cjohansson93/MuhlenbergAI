Women's Basketball Clamps Down on Dickinson
 Thursday, January 30, 2014







					 






Senior Katy Mitton hit this jumper from the paint to give the Mules their first double-digit lead, 22-12, with 2:11 left in the first half.






Laney scored six of Muhlenberg's first seven points en route to reaching double figures for the eighth time this season.



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was delayed about 45 minutes on its way to play Dickinson due to heavy traffic on I-81.

In the game, it was the Mules who put up the roadblocks.

Muhlenberg put forth its stingiest defensive effort in a Centennial Conference road game in eight years, allowing only 12 field goals in a 48-35 win.

Junior Leanna Tallamy (19 points, 9 rebounds) and senior Erin Laney (10 points, 8 rebounds) just missed  double-doubles for the Mules, who last gave up so few points on the road in a 75-34 win at Washington during the 2005-06 season.

With their fourth straight win, and sixth in the last seven games, the Mules (11-7, 8-4) remained a game behind third-place McDaniel, their opponent at home on Saturday, in the CC standings.

Muhlenberg hit some snarls of its own on offense at the start of the game and trailed 10-9 with about nine minutes left in the half. But the Mules held the Red Devils (4-13, 1-11) to just one field goal over a span of more than nine minutes, closing the half on a 21-6 run to take a 14-point lead into the locker room.

Tallamy scored nine of her points in the run, two after hustling after a teammate’s airball, throwing the ball to junior Nicole Pepe while falling out of bounds, and getting a return pass from Pepe for a jumper that beat the shot clock.

Pepe punctuated the half-ending surge by nailing a three from the wing at the buzzer.

Muhlenberg led by as many as 17 points in the second half. Dickinson drew to within six with 6:30 left, but again the Mules closed out strong, not allowing a field goal the rest of the way.

Tallamy, who led Muhlenberg in scoring for the seventh straight game, also blocked two shots.

Cross Country Performance is Not "Two Shoddy"
 Friday, September 30, 2011 - page 2







					 


The Muhlenberg cross country teams broke out sharp new red uniforms, replacing the old grey ones, for the Paul Short Run at Lehigh. For one 



of the Mules, though, the uniform change was even more extreme.

Junior Nate Crossette lost one of his shoes during the first mile but still managed to finish as one of the top five runners for the men’s team. His outstanding effort was part of an encouraging day for the Muhlenberg teams in one of the largest cross country meets in the nation.

The Mule women (right) came in 26th out of 44 teams in a field that included teams from all 



three divisions, who traveled from faraway places like Buffalo, Nebraska and Florida. Out of the 13 Division III squads in the race, Muhlenberg came in eighth. 

One of the teams the Mules finished ahead of Marywood, which entered the week ranked fifth in the Mideast Region, three spots ahead of Muhlenberg. The seven teams to finish ahead of the Mules are all regionally ranked.

Junior Samantha Mayden led Muhlenberg in 67th place, 18th among Division III runners, in a field of 386. Sophomore Nicki Cronin was right behind her in 73rd. 

Junior Erica Bash, the Mules’ fifth runner, cut 22 seconds off the time she ran on the same course at the season-opening Lehigh Invitational four weeks ago.

The men were 35th out of 46 teams, 15th out of 18 in Division III. One of the teams they finished ahead of was 38th-place DeSales, which beat Muhlenberg at the Lehigh Invitational.

Senior William Lowrey (left) ran a very solid race, coming in 62nd out of 382.

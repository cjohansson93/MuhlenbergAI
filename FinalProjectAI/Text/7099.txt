Men's Golf Earns Matte Award Point
 Tuesday, October 8, 2013







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished second at the inaugural John Makuvek Cup, named after the longtime Moravian golf coach.

The Mules were six strokes behind DeSales but finished two ahead of Moravian, earning a Matte Award point. In the two previous tournaments in which both schools
competed, Moravian finished ahead of Muhlenberg, but the Makuvek Cup was designated as the Matte Award contest.

The annual all-sports competition is tied 2-2. The next scheduled contest is a women’s soccer match at Moravian on October 30.

Freshman David Barkley tied for third, three strokes off the lead, with a 79. Senior Christopher Lucarelli was one stroke behind.

Of the 15 golfers in the field, only three shot a birdie on a par-3 hole: the medalist from Moravian, who did it twice, Lucarelli and freshman John Froberg (right).

women’s basketball hops past hopkins





Although she did not score a point, sopohomore Kaitlyn O’Malley 
dished out a game-high five assists and blocked three shots.



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team kept making steady steps in
the Centennial Conference, adding another game to the winning column. 

The Mules (11-3, 6-1 CC) extended their winning streak to six games after
defeating the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, 67-52, at Goldfarb Gymnasium in
Baltimore.

It was the second straight year the team traveled to Baltimore and came
home happy with a win. Prior to last season, Muhlenberg had never won a
regular-season game at Johns Hopkins.

Freshman guard Kelly McKeon scored a career-high 22 points, grabbed
eight rebounds and dished out three assists. She shot 10-of-12 from the
free throw line, including six consecutive successful attempts in the
final two minutes. 

“Coming to Johns Hopkins, we knew we had to hustle and play
hard,” McKeon said. “It was a big win for us against a tough
opponent.”

After exchanging the leadership with the Blue Jays in the beginning of the
game, the Mules established a 17-11 lead on a layup by McKeon with 8:33
remaining in the first half. 

The visitors entered the second half leading 27-23. Muhlenberg kept
steadily building on the advantage, which reached eight points (43-35)
midway through the second half.

Johns Hopkins managed to cut the deficit to as many as four points (45-41)
on a three-pointer by Kristin Phillips with 9:27 left, but the Mules went
on an 8-0 spurt, establishing a comfortable 53-41 cushion, which they
maintained until the final whistle. 

In the waning seconds, McKeon demonstrated stable nerves from the free
throw line.

“I tried not to think about the free throws, ” McKeon said.
“Theres always pressure, but I tried to relax and make them. ”

Junior Lauren Boyle added 16 points for the Mules, moving into the
top 10 on the team’s all-time list with 894 career points. Freshman
Sheila Cook finished with nine points, and senior Michelle
Feldman contributed seven rebounds and four points.

Muhlenberg limited its opposition to 26.4-percent shooting from the floor,
despite being outrebounded by the Blue Jays, 55-40.

remembering Tom grace
 


Family, friends and many Muhlenberg athletes and coaches packed Egner Memorial Chapel last night for a 


memorial service for Tom Grace.

Grace, who was forced to retire 

as the Mules’ equipment manager last spring because of ALS, passed away at the age of 74 on November 3.

Remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather and a 

killer racquetball player, Grace was described as a “friend, mentor, and for some a surrogate parent” in a eulogy by former Dean of Students Rudy Ehrenberg.

“It was like he woke up every morning asking, what can I do to make someone happy today,” said Ehrenberg, who said he talked to him about things that were going on because he had a huge heart, was bright and very perceptive.

Ehrenberg also related a story from last football season, when Grace was on the sidelines in his motorized scooter at a Muhlenberg game. On two different occasions, 
Grace saw something that needed attending, so he got out of his scooter, walked over to the problem and fixed it. Unfortunately for Tom, the game was being televised live, 
and he got an angry cell phone call from his wife, Becky, who was watching at home.

Tom’s love for Becky, Muhlenberg’s assistant director of residential services, came out throughout the service, which included a poem written by assistant athletic trainer Lindsay Weiss.

Muhlenberg’s coaches also had high praise. “The one thing I will always remember about Tom Grace is that he always called you Mr. or Mrs.,” said track and field coach Brad Hackett. “He was the only guy I ever knew who did that and it always made me feel good and respected. Tom Grace always treated the coaches great and with the upmost respect.  He loved the students, and not just the athletes. His awareness of Muhlenberg College went outside athletics.”

“Tom Grace was a wonderful person and a great friend to me,” said women’s tennis coach Linda Andrews. “He worked closely with tennis and every time I pick up the equipment to fix down the nets, I am reminded of him and his help.”

Nothing summed up his life more than the title of the first hymn sung during the service: “Amazing Grace.”

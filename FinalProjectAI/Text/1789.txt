Citation Guides



Library Home|Research|Citation Guides






Always ask your instructor which style of scholarly citation you need to use for a particular paper or project. Knowing when and how to document your sources allows you to build a foundation for your own ideas, take part in a scholarly conversation, and avoid any charge of plagiarism. You can see the College's 
			official plagiarism policy.

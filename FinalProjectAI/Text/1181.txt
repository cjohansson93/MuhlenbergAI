The Muhlenberg Mathematics and Computer Science department includes the disciplines of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics and computer science. Our structured curriculum prepares students to develop their appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics, pursue graduate work in mathematics, computer science and related fields, leverage the applications of mathematics or computers in the natural and social sciences and provide a strong foundation for those entering the teaching profession.
Our program provides a course of study that can be customized to individual's goals and interests, while at the same time exposing students to multiple facets of mathematics and computer science. Our faculty recognize a responsibility to students with other majors and offer courses designed to equip those students with the mathematical knowledge and tools required for their chosen fields of study.

Alumni Update
Carrie Jablansky '15 â Sociology Major, Business Minor, Active Theatre Community Member
Carrie Jablansky started work in January 2019 as the Assistant Company Manager for the National Tour of The Book of Mormon! She hits the road after spending six months as Assistant Company Manager on the Broadway production of KING KONG.
The tour will keep her on the road for the next year or soâ¦ look for the tour to swing through Philly in late May and early June.
âIâm so grateful for the experiences Iâve had,â Carrie says. âFrom the management side, we get to see the full picture of putting on a Broadway show. It truly takes a village â it goes beyond the people on stage and backstage. Itâs working with press teams, marketing teams, data and analytics teams who look into sales trends and ticket prices, to the people who create the show merchandise, to travel agents, to so much more. Iâve gotten to meet many amazing and talented people who all help get the show up 8 times a week. Itâs the best!â

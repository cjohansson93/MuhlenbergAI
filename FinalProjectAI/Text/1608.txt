Dr. Penelope Dunham, associate professor of mathematics at Muhlenberg College, was honored with the prestigious Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching at the College’s 157th Commencement ceremony last Sunday.

For more than thirty years, the Lindback Foundation has generously provided Muhlenberg College with funds to be used for special awards, and the winner of the Christian R. and Mary F. Lindback Award is a professor whose distinguished teaching makes a profound contribution to the intellectual growth of his or her students.

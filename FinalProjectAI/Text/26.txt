Why study Russian at Muhlenberg?
Historically, Muhlenberg was among the first colleges in the United States to offer undergraduate students the opportunity to study the Russian language and culture. Today, Muhlenberg's dynamic Russian Studies program continues to be responsive to the changing times in Russia without neglecting the country's rich cultural and historic heritage.
Muhlenberg's Russian Studies Program is interdisciplinary in nature, providing students with a balanced combination of courses in language, literature, history, politics, music, and art as well as sociological and anthropological topics.
The interdisciplinary nature of the program combines well with other majors and minors and enables students to fulfill academic requirements in the humanities and social sciences.
The program helps to develop an understanding of and respect for human diversity and prepares students for today and tomorrow's global community. The program is particularly appropriate for students who wish to pursue graduate work and research, as well as careers in international relations, business, law, politics, government service, teaching and other fields.
Instruction in Russian Studies courses takes place in small classes which provide opportunities for individual attention from Russian Studies faculty. Peer tutoring by native speakers of Russian is also available.
Independent Study allows students to research and examine areas of their particular interest in greater depth.
Classroom instruction is supplemented by a wide range of multimedia materials: faculty-designed and commercial computer software, multilingual word processors and dictionaries, collections of online resources for the study of Russian, video materials, films, and satellite television.
The College's Trexler Library offers a rich collection of books on Russian and Slavic topics, both in Russian and English. A representative selection of periodicals, documentaries, and feature films is also available.
Through the Russian Studies Program and the Russian Club, students are constantly engaged in extracurricular activities including visits to Russian exhibits, theater and opera performances, as well as Russian cuisine in nearby cities. Russian Studies students can also take advantage of links to the local Russian immigrant community.
Students are encouraged to participate in established study abroad programs through other colleges or organizations such as the American Council of Teachers of Russian.

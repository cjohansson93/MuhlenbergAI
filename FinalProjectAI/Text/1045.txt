About Me
I choose to work at Muhlenberg College because of the close-knit community I feel with the incredible staff and unique students on this campus. I look forward to being a part of an inclusive campus and observing a comprehensive feel of safety and growth here.
Currently in my 6th year of working in Student Affairs with a focus on Housing and Residence Life, I began my career by earning my Bachelorâs in English from Rutgers University - Camden, New Jersey and my attained Masterâs in Conflict Analysis and Dispute Resolution at Salisbury University in the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland. I have a passion for crisis management, appreciative coaching, and making students feel welcome and capable as they grow.
Just some things about me: I am a US Army Veteran with 2 combat tours in Operation Iraqi Freedom, I love good books and video games with great stories, and I have an affinity with Marvel comic characters.

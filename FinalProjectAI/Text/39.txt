 Kerri Cossean '11 Majors: Russian Studies/History Masters in History
Florida International University (2014) Current: Program Assistant, Dept. of State Foreign Service Institute Past Internships: Executive Office at US Embassy in Moscow, Russia Southern Command
I graduated Cum Laude from Muhlenberg College in 2011 with a double major in History and Russian Studies. I decided to continue my education at Florida International University. In Spring 2013, I was chosen to intern in the Executive Office at the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia, where I  worked alongside former American Ambassador Michael McFaul. This past spring I did an internship at Southern Command, an integral part of the Department of Defense in Doral, Florida. I graduated this past May with a Master’s degree in History. Going forward I am interested in working for the U.S. government.

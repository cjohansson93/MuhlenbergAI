O'Hara, Liddic, Killing Put Up Big Numbers in Men's Basketball Loss
 Saturday, January 21, 2012 - page 2







					 





Killing made all eight of his free throws and is shooting 81.0 percent from the line this season.


It was anything but a winter wonderland for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team at Washington.

Despite holding the lead at the half, the Mules could not get a bounce to go their way after the break and fell to the Shoremen, 86-78.

In the loss, junior Matt O’Hara became the first Mule since 1997 to reach double figures in assists, dishing out 10 helpers. Senior Spencer Liddic recorded the 38th double-double of his career with 21 points and 11 rebounds. He moved into fifth place in Mule men’s basketball history with 1,523 career points and grabbed his 900th career rebound.

The game was tight from the opening tip as neither team was able to create much separation. The Mules (10-6, 4-6) led by five 
twice, the largest advantage in the opening 20 minutes, but went into the locker room up just 35-34.

Sophomore Kevin Hargrove scored 10 points and pulled down five rebounds in the half to lead the Mules, who only turned the ball over twice in opening frame.

But Washington (11-6, 7-3) caught fire out of the break, hitting five of its first six shots, including a pair of threes, to outscore the Mules 15-4 and grab a double-digit lead less than five minutes into the second half.

And whenever the Mules were able to cut back into the lead, the Shoremen responded. Muhlenberg got to within a possession four times in the final 5:28, but could never pull in front.

Junior Hunter Forsman – who also had two dunks in the game – made it 72-69 with a layup off a feed from freshman Malique Killing with 2:53 to play. Then Washington missed a 3-pointer on its next possession, and the ball bounced off a Shoreman going for the rebound, but then it deflected off of a Mule before falling out of bounds.

Washington got a layup off of that possession to make it a five-point game and never looked back as it shot better than 51.5 percent in the second half.

Killing scored a game-high 25 points.

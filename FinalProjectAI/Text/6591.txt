Field Hockey Wins Third Straight
 Wednesday, October 3, 2012 - page 3







					 



Winning by four goals felt so good, the Muhlenberg field hockey team tried it again.

The Mules built some more momentum for their key upcoming stretch of Centennial Conference games by knocking off Bryn Mawr, 5-1. Prior to Saturday’s 4-0 win at Dickinson, Muhlenberg (7-3, 3-2) hadn’t won a game by more than one goal this season.

The nine goals in two games were the most by the Mules since 2008, when one of the games was an 8-0 win against Bryn Mawr. They hadn’t won back-to-back games by four goals since 2007.

Muhlenberg (7-3, 3-2) began the scoring early, with sophomore Christine Germaske converting a pass from classmate Kayleigh Thies just 7:20 into the game. It was the 10th career assist for Thies, making her the 15th player in team history to reach double digits.

Junior Dayna Hovern made it 2-0 by putting in a rebound for her 10th career goal midway through the half.

The Mules put the game away by tallying three goals in a span of a little more than five minutes in the second half. Sophomore Samantha Swire scored the first two just 99 seconds apart to take over the team lead with five on the season. Junior Erin Cummings capped the run with her third goal in two games.

Junior Mariah Alston (right) assisted on two of the three goals for her first career multiple-point game.

The Owls (5-5, 0-4) who came into the game as the top-scoring team in the CC, put one in late to snap Muhlenberg’s unscored-on string at 221 minutes.

The Mules will take their three-game winning streak into Saturday’s key home matchup with 2011 CC playoff qualifier Washington. Of the five remaining CC games for Muhlenberg, three are against teams that made the playoffs last year.

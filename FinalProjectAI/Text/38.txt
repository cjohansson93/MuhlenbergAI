 Sydney Yonak '13 Major: Political Science Minor: Russian Studies Current: FHI 360, Open World Program
I currently work as a Program Assistant at FHI 360 which, is a nonprofit human development organization dedicated to improving lives in lasting ways. I work specifically in the Open World Program that is sponsored by the U.S. Congress, which brings emerging leaders from participating countries to the United States. Open World delegates, who are selected by U.S. Embassies in collaboration with the Open World Leadership Center, represent a broad diversity of technical areas. My job combines several things which I am passionate about; Russian, charity and working with people from former Soviet Union Republic countries such as Ukraine and Kazakhstan. It is incredibly varied and no two days are alike. I am able to really contribute towards something worthwhile and something of interest to me personally.

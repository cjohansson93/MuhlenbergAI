Besher Tolaymat â15 sees similarities between the research he did at Muhlenberg with Professor of Chemistry Joseph Keane and the diagnoses he hopes to make as a doctor. Research starts with a question, a premise to look into. A patient comes in with symptoms, something to investigate further. In both, you follow the evidence until an answer appears. âI understood [going into medical school] what it was like to go into the unknown,â Tolaymat says.
Thatâs not the only connection between Tolaymatâs experiences as a chemistry and music double major at Muhlenberg and as a fourth-year medical student at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. As an undergraduate, Tolaymat worked as a chemistry tutor. Thatâs when he unknowingly began to practice a surgical axiom common among medical students: See one, do one, teach one. âIt helped me in chemistry,â he says. âWhile I was tutoring others, it helped my own work.â Itâs something that he sees now as a medical student, learning from residents who only a few years ago were in his shoes.
Though Tolaymat entered Muhlenberg knowing he was going to be a chemistry major, he quickly found that he also wanted to explore his love of bass guitar and music. He decided to add a double major in music, and he uses that training today.
âMy choice of medicine reflects my double major,â he says. âThereâs the medicine stuff, but then thereâs the aspect of applying it to a person. You can know the science, but if you donât develop a bond theyâre not going to trust you. You have to be aware of a lot of other things. I can give them the perfect plan, but other things may get in the way. You canât lose the humanity.â

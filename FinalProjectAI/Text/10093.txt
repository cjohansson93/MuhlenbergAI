The Edwin W. Miller Awards in Writing were established by Edwin Millerâs wife, Lillian Krumholz Miller, in honor of her late husband. Edwin Miller was a publisher and editor who founded POB Publishing Company, and its namesake monthly magazine, POB (Point of Beginning). The company also published technical and historical books in the field of surveying, mapping, and engineering. He was a life-long supporter of higher education and the arts, but his passion was editing. In honor of his fifty years in the editing and publishing field, this writing award will, in a small way, continue his passion: supporting writers and their work.

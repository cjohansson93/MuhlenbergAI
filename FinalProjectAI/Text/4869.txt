WOMENS LAX GOES FOR ONE LAST RIDE IN DISNEY 





Shegoski doubled her career goal total with her performance against Kings.





Space Mountain may be one of the biggest attractions in Disney World, but on its final day in Orlando the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team put a mountain of space between itself and its opponent.

The Mules rolled early, scoring 10 goals in the first 12 minutes, and then coasted to a 20-1 victory over Kings, ending its spring break trip with another massive win and upping its winning streak against non-conference opponents to 29 games.

Muhlenberg scored the first six goals of the game  including the first just 46 seconds in  in the opening 4:44 of action. A goal with 9:46 to play in the first gave the Mules a 14-1 lead, but they could not come up with another to tie the school record for goals scored in a half (something theyve already done once this season).

 Muhlenberg added six more in the second and kept Kings off the board, allowing the Monarchs just six shots total for the game while firing 32 of its own.

Junior Danielle Rosen had her third straight monster game, putting up the exact same career-best line  five goals and four assists  as she did in the season opener. Senior Amanda McGovern also posted her second five-goal game in the last three and added two assists, falling just one point shy of her career high of eight.

Muhlenbergs two other seniors also had big days. Alyssa Bascelli scored a hat trick, and Danielle Scarrone set new career highs for assists (four) and points (five).

Several Mules also recorded career firsts. Freshman Mallori Seliger netted her first career goal and later scored another, and classmate Alex Bellini and sophomore Maggie Hare also tallied their first career goals. Sophomore Jessica Shegoski scored twice, recording her first career multi-goal game.

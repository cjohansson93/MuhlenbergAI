The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team swept the doubles and went on to defeat Gettysburg, 8-1, for its first Centennial Conference win of the season.

The Mules, who won only one of nine doubles matches in their first three matches of the spring, took close contests at No. 1, where seniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szukman teamed up for an 8-6 victory, and at No. 3, where junior Jennifer Goldberg and senior Gabriela Contino prevailed, 8-5.

In between, the team of freshman Sara Finger and junior Sharen Resnikoff had a more comfortable 8-1 win.

Finger (right) went on to breeze to a 6-0, 6-1 win at No. 1 singles, remaining undefeated for the spring season. Sanders and Szulman also won in straight sets, with Szulman coming out on top against an opponent who was previously undefeated.

Goldberg and freshman Jamie Rosenblum added singles wins in pro sets.

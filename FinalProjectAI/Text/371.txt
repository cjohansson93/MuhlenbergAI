About Muhlenberg College School of Graduate Studies



          Why should I choose a Muhlenberg College master's degree?



  








As a Muhlenberg graduate student, youâll be part of an academically strong learning community with a reputation for fostering close relationships with faculty and among students. Our instructors bring both strong academic credentials and deep industry experience, and they are committed to preparing you for success. You will also build your professional network through interactions with other students who bring varied backgrounds and interests to the classroom, making for a rich and dynamic experience. 







          What graduate programs are offered at Muhlenberg?
  








As a graduate student, you can elect to enter either a masterâs degree or graduate-level certificate program. Our masterâs degree programs are designed to give experienced professionals and recent college graduates the skills and expertise to be highly successful in their field. Currently, you can earn a masterâs degree in one of the following areas:

Applied Analytics for Organizations
Organizational Leadership.

Graduate-level certificate programs can give you in-depth knowledge in a particular field to expand your skills, give you an edge in hiring and promotion, and/or help you transition to a new career. If you complete a graduate certificate, your credits will fully transfer into the corresponding masterâs degree program.. Currently, you can earn a certificate in Applied Analytics for Organizations or Organizational Leadership.






          Are the graduate programs accredited?



  








Muhlenbergâs graduate programs and certificates are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.







          How long will it take me to complete a program?
  








You can complete a masterâs degree within two calendar years and a graduate certificate in one calendar year. For both programs, two consecutive eight-week courses will run each fall, spring and summer term.
 






          How many courses will I take?

  








The number of courses required to complete the masterâs degree and/or the graduate certificate may vary depending upon the particular program. Muhlenberg uses a system of course units. Each course is of equal value and should be considered the equivalent of four credits for conversion purposes. In general, the masterâs will consist of 10-12 course units, and the certificate 3-6 units. For the most up-to-date information, review the program pages in the student catalog. 






          What is the typical workload for graduate school?

  








Our programs are designed to be flexible so that you can make them fit in your schedule. The fastest path to finishing either the degree or the graduate certificate course requirements is to take two consecutive eight-week courses a semester. 






          What does it mean that the courses are blended?



  








Courses are taught in a blended (also called hybrid) model, combining online learning with face-to-face meetings, service learning and self-directed study. This blended method is a great way to add a graduate program to your busy life. The syllabus for each course will include specific requirements including, but not limited to, required meeting times for classes, oral and/or written examinations, written papers and presentations, and research.
 
 
 






          What are the requirements for graduation?
  








Fulfill all your course requirements with a minimum GPA of 3.0, then complete the Application for Degree form to order the diploma, cap, and gown as well as to provide the College with legacy, activities, and local newspaper information. 
 






          How does parking work?



  








All graduate students must register their vehicle(s) with campus security and display a parking decal.  Permit fee(s) are included in your tuition. Registering your car can be done online. There are student designated parking lots as well as on-street parking.  Handicapped spaces are available for those who qualify for a state issued license plate/placard, which should be visibly displayed on the vehicle.
 
 






          What are the technology requirements?



  








At the minimum, you should have access to a laptop with reliable connection to the internet. Laptops are small and light enough to carry to classes for notes, the library for research, elsewhere on campus, or home and office to work on assignments. Consider where you will want to use your computer when deciding between a desktop and a laptop. Note that there are wireless hotspots on campus, and those spots continue to expand. Desktop computers are larger and weigh more than a portable, but are generally less expensive. They have more computing power for a given price.  Please note the Office of Information Technology only provides on-campus service for student computers. Therefore students are required to carry their computers to the Student Help desk if they require assistance.
When youâre admitted, you will be assigned a secure Capstone Online account, so you can access your academic (schedules, grades),  billing records, and login credentials for our learning management system, Canvas, a space where you can connect with and interact with course content. This can include posting/submitting assignments, participating in discussions, taking online quizzes/tests, etc. Helpful information and a Canvas Student User Guide are available.



Graduate Admission



          What are the requisites for admission?
  








We encourage you to visit our campus and meet with the VP Executive Director, Dean of Graduate Studies, or other Graduate Admissions advisors. Visiting prior to applying is not necessary, but it can be a chance to explore the fit between you and Muhlenberg College School of Graduate Studies and give you a chance to develop a relationship with a graduate advisor who can be an advocate and resource for you.
Our Graduate Studies admissions team welcomes the opportunity to talk with you.  You should have:

An undergraduate degree from an accredited school in the U.S. or equivalent foreign degree
Prior positive academic performance, career accomplishments, community engagement through volunteerism, and other leadership activities that demonstrate your potential for graduate study and how you plan to contribute to your profession and to the community

If you are applying for the Master of Organizational Leadership (MOL), you should have a basic foundation in accounting and finance, such as financial accounting or principles-level economics and two-years of work experience. If you are a senior or recent graduate you may meet this requirement through appropriate professional work experiences through internships, summer work, externships, and projects that may be sufficient.
If you are applying for the Master of Applied Analytics for Organizations (MAA), you should have successfully completed statistics and calculus courses within the last five years. If you havenât taken these courses, or if you would like a refresher, donât worry! We offer a half-unit pre-course that covers mathematical concepts integral to success in the program.
If you are a college junior or senior interested in the MAA or MOL, you may be able to enroll in conjunction with your bachelorâs degree, with certain graduate courses fulfilling both undergraduate and graduate requirements. You will need approval from your current academic advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies before you apply and enroll.
 
Financial hardship should not be a barrier to enrollment. Please contact an advisor to discuss options






          Do I have to take graduate entrance exams?


  








GRE/GMAT test scores are optional.






          Which graduate exam should I take?

          Are interviews required?
  








An interview is not required prior to applying. However, after you have submitted your application you will be contacted to arrange a personal interview.  The interview can be in-person or, for convenience, scheduled using web video conferencing.
 






          What does Muhlenberg look for in a qualified candidate?


  








Graduate admissions will evaluate an applicantâs portfolio (transcripts, grades, writing sample in the form of a personal statement, any standardized test scores, and resume).  Overall, we are looking for students who are academically prepared for graduate level coursework; possess effective writing skills; demonstrate a spirit of inquiry in their field of study; have a clear vision of how the graduate program will help them achieve their goals; are a good fit through shared values and attitudes.

Prospective graduate students should value and desire to further develop themselves in:


vigorous and open-minded debate 
critical independent thinking and ability to challenge intellectual orthodoxy
research and the creation of new knowledge
analytical and creative efforts
working collaboratively with others and support to each other, while challenging each other to excel
developing ethical standards
stretching personal limits of knowledge and understanding through risk-taking 
contributing to a distinctive campus climate characterized by warmth, friendliness, a strong sense of community, and close relationships among students, faculty, and staff
mutual respect for differing ideas, perspectives, experiences, and personal identities
participating in a culture in which fairness, equality, human diversity, and justice are successfully integrated with the healthy clash of ideas and beliefs
being good neighbors and good citizens, particularly in the greater Lehigh Valley region, and to improve the lives of those inside and outside our economic ecosystem


 






          How do I apply for the Masterâs Program?
  








Before you begin the online application, we recommend you have on hand the following items.  With these items on hand, it should take you about 10 minutes of your time to complete our online application.

About the Graduate Programs



          Are there any prerequisites needed to enter a program?
  








All applicants must have completed a four-year baccalaureate degree or international equivalent or an appropriate US/Canadian alternative degree from a regionally accredited or recognized international college or university.


Applicants for the Organizational Leadership (MOL), Masterâs Degree will typically have two or more years of work experience. We also recommend that entering students have had some college or working experience related to leadership, such as in human resources, planning, management, public administration, and/or organizational psychology. College seniors or recent graduates may meet this requirement through appropriate professional experiences, such as internships, summer work, externships, athletics, creative activities, and projects.

Applicants to the Master of Applied Analytics (MAA) for Organizations will have successfully completed statistics and calculus courses within the last five years. For those who do not meet this requirement or who desire to refresh their knowledge and skills, Muhlenberg College offers a half-unit pre-course covering mathematical concepts integral to a studentâs success in the masterâs program.







          How long do I have to complete the program?
  








Typically, a masterâs degree will be completed within two years of the initial enrollment and will not exceed five years with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate certificate will be completed in one year or less and will not exceed three years from the initial enrollment.
 







          What is the difference between a graduate certificate and a masterâs degree?
  








Both the graduate certificate and the masterâs degree provides the mid-career learner who is seeking to advance their education beyond the baccalaureate level either for personal or professional reasons with academic credentials validating their specialized studies.  For the traditional student, graduate studies enhance their undergraduate academic training by adding substantial depth in a focused area of study. Choosing a graduate certificate or masterâs degree depends on the individual's specific career objectives.  
Masterâs
Individuals typically seek a graduate degree to build skills in their industry, gain skills to transition to a new field, or to promote into a higher level position within their area of expertise. A masterâs degree is a complete program in a field of study from a recognized accredited institution. The graduate degree shows you have obtained mastery in a field of study, rather than a single subject. 
Graduate Certificate
For those who have been away from academic studies for a number of years, and/or may have time and budget constraints, returning by completing a graduate certificate is a shorter duration commitment while providing a future pathway to completing the full masterâs degree at a later time.  A graduate certificate does not take the place of a masterâs degree, however it does provide students an option to gain knowledge and skills to become employable or eligible for a specific job more quickly.
We encourage you to meet with one of our graduate advisors to consider which is a better solution for your career or personal goals.  When considering a graduate certificate or masterâs degree, it is a good idea to have your end goal in mind. Do your research by examining regional labor statistics, market demand, employer expectations, and trends.






          What are the program start dates?
  








Our program is built on a cohort model to optimize the relationships you will build with your faculty and fellow graduate students.  The programs will be starting this Fall semester on August 31, 2020 and run on a full-year schedule (3 semesters: Fall, Spring, and Summer).







          When are the application deadlines?
  








Graduate program applications are accepted at any time.  Once accepted, you will work with your graduate advisor to schedule into the next available cohort.  However, if you desire to start on a specific date, your application is required two weeks prior to the start of the first course.






          Is this a full-time or part-time program?
  








The Masterâs of Organizational Leadership and the Masterâs of Applied Analytics are full-time and can be finished in two calendar years. The graduate certificate programs in Organizational Leadership and Applied Analytics are also full-time and can be finished in one calendar year.
 






          Are there any residency requirements?
  








It is recommended that you follow the schedule of two courses per semester, which will enable you to finish the degree in two years and the certificate in one (each course takes eight weeks). Our programs offer a blended course design combining online learning with face-to-face meetings, service learning and self-study. This blended method is a great way to add a graduate program to your busy life. The syllabus for each course will include specific requirements, including but not limited to required meeting times for classes, oral and/or written examinations, written papers and presentations, and research. Students must maintain at least a one-course presence each semester.
 






          What if I need to take a leave of absence?
  








There are several situations in which your graduate studies may be interrupted, including medical, military, and other personal leaves of absence. A leave of absence enables you to suspend your enrollment at Muhlenberg. A student requesting a leave of absence should consult with their graduate advisor and/or the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies. A student may withdraw from a course and any refund will be according to the Collegeâs refund policy.

          How much does a graduate program cost?

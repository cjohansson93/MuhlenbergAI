Teaching Interests
I use journalism as a launching pad for exploring what it means to be an engaged citizen and to encourage students to ask big questions about the human condition. As a researcher and reporter, I have a keen interest in journalism ethics and fact-based reporting and my classes provide a blend of journalism case studies, ethical discussions and hands-on writing and reporting. 
I firmly believe that the real lessons of journalism happen outside the classroom, which is why I consider my role as faculty advisor to the Muhlenberg Weekly a significant aspect of my teaching at Muhlenberg. I publish my students' work on Berg Beat, an online magazine that is an adjunct to the Weekly as well as a website I maintain for environmental journalism-related work, Lehigh Valley Almanac.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsFor over 20 years I have worked as a reporter and editorial researcher/fact-checker for magazines, book authors and websites including Menâs Health, Success, Cooking Light, whattoexpect.com, parenting.com and The Newish Jewish Encyclopedia.

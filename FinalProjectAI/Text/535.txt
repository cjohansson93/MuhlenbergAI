Today, LâOrÃ©al Paris announced that Val Weisler â20, whoâs pursuing a self-designed major in educational advocacy, is one of the 10 recipients of the companyâs 2017 Women of Worth awards. That means sheâll receive $10,000 to support her teen-empowerment organization, The Validation Project, with a chance to earn another $25,000 if she can get the most votes here.
The award is appropriate because, as Val says, The Validation Project is focused on âshowing teens that they have worth.â And thatâs been Valâs focus since the first act of kindness that inspired her to start the organization.
In Valâs first year of high school, kids bullied her for being shy. âPeople would come up to me and ask if I was physically able to talk,â she says. She was, and she used her voice to empathize with another student she saw being bullied: âYou matter,â she told him. He then confided in her that heâd been planning to commit suicide that night, but that her kind words had âreally validated him.â
That evening, Val built a website that addressed her schoolâs bullying problem and shared it on Facebook. Classmates chimed in with their stories of victimization, and they started a lunchtime meetup group. This website and group grew into The Validation Project.
At first, the goal was to reduce bullying through what Val calls âtwo-part validation:â the group would pair a student with a mentor who would teach them more about something they were interested in, and then the student would âpay it forwardâ by using those skills for good in their community. âBullies see they can feel big not by hurting someone else but by helping someone else,â Val says. Itâs a pro-kindness, entrepreneurship curriculum meant to replace the anti-bullying curriculum that proved ineffective at Valâs school.
Since then, though, the groupâs objectives have become more diverse, as its reach has grown to include 105 countries (including Myanmar, where the photo at right was taken) and 1,000 schools. âNow, we donât just focus on bullying but whatever issues teenagers are going through, whether thatâs a lack of education for female students in a developing country or the experience of coming out as gay in Oklahoma,â Val says.
At Muhlenberg, Val has organized campaigns on campus, including one in which young women wrote encouraging letters to girls after last yearâs presidential election. Sheâs also brought on board her friend Olivia Gaynor â20, a media & communication major, to help spread the word about The Validation Project. Olivia created the Projectâs celebrity ambassador program, which includes Jazz Jennings (of TLCâs âI Am Jazzâ) and Nia Frazier (of Lifetimeâs âDance Momsâ), and helps manage the groupâs social media presence.
âItâs all about inspiring young people to be themselves and do whatever they want to do in life, which is something everyone can benefit from,â Olivia says. âI thought Valâs message should be projected out to more people because she was doing such great work.â
The Women of Worth award money will help with that effort: Val hopes to build an app that would help users learn what action they can take in their communities at any given time, and to host a Validation Project conference. âItâd be great to have all the chapters and teens meet each other face to face,â Val says. âSome of them have been communicating online for the past five years.â
This fall, Val is balancing a series of speaking engagements at Canadian WE Day Eventsâstadium-sized gatherings of young people that focus on enacting positive social changeâwith her schoolwork. âIâm really lucky that my professors are really supportive of what I do,â Val says.
Education professor John Ramsay, whom Val counts as one of her mentors, is one such professor. âVal brings an intense intellectual curiosity about difficult human problems, the honesty to confront inconvenient facts, an eagerness to explore the gaps between academic models and real world behaviors and a hunger for feedback about what she's misreading or not entirely grasping,â Ramsay says. âShe's building this Validation Project, growing it, making it resilient and durable.â
It means a lot to Val that her professors are able to speak to the important work sheâs doing outside the classroom. âOne of the reasons I love Muhlenberg is itâs a small college and the professors care about you,â Val says. âYouâre not just a name on a sheet; youâre a student with a personality.â

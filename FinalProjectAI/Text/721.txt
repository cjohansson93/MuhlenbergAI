 Lindsey Aspinall An Anti-Smoking Public Health Campaign: No Ifs Ands or ButtsAccording to the American Cancer Society, there are over 400,000 smoking-related deaths each year in the United States. In addition, according to the Campus Tobacco 101 studies, 30% of college students are smokers. These staggering statistics were the inspiration for an Anti-Smoking Campaign implemented within Dr. Kahlenberg's Health Communication class. Our group of ten students organized a semester worth of data and studies into a campus-wide effort to make Muhlenberg students more aware of the health consequences of smoking. Following the method of producing a Public Health Campaign, we gathered data through surveying students (to produce an Audience Segmentation), studied past anti-smoking campaigns (producing an extensive Review of Literature), and developed an overall proposal to implement two days-worth of anti-smoking events on Muhlenberg's campus. This semester-long research, is a project that I sincerely dedicated myself to, and am excited to share with others.

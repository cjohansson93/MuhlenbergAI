Men’s Lacrosse Falls on the Road, Softball at Home


The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team fell behind 2-0 in the first four minutes and never caught up, falling at Swarthmore, 9-6.

The Mules (2-6, 0-2) trailed by one goal at halftime, 6-5, but were blanked in the third quarter and scored just one goal in the fourth.

Jon Thomas scored three goals to become the first Muhlenberg freshman since 2009 to record a hat trick.

The regional rankings predicted a close match between the Muhlenberg and Swarthmore women’s tennis teams, and the rankings proved to be right.

Swarthmore, ranked 11th in the Atlantic South Region, swept the doubles and hung on to defeat Muhlenberg (ranked 12th), 5-4, in a match between two teams that reached the Centennial Conference semifinals last year.

The decisive match proved to be at No. 1 doubles, where the Garnet saved two match points en route to a 9-8 (9-7) win. 

The loss left the Mules in a 3-0 hole, but they rebounded nicely to capture four of six singles matches. Sophomore Emily Szulman, who was part of the tough doubles loss, played exceptionally well in winning her No. 2 singles match, 6-1, 7-5.

Freshman Jennifer Goldberg made a comeback of her own, winning the third set 6-1 after a 6-0 loss in the second. Freshman Sharen Resnikoff (pictured) and junior Amanda von Taube both picked up their first singles wins of the spring in straight sets.

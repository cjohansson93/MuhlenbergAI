Dr. Coutinho is a specialist in early Chinese philosophy with an emphasis on early Daoist texts. He studied at University College London, where he did his B.A. in analytical philosophy, and M.Phil in the phenomenology of Husserl. At the University of Hawai'i, he completed his Ph.D. in Chinese and Comparative Philosophy under the supervision of Roger Ames, and studied classical Chinese with David McCraw.
He has taught at the University of London, the University of Hawai'i, and Towson University. He came to Muhlenberg College in 2005, where he teaches courses in Philosophies of China, Philosophies of India, Daoist Philosophies, Logic, and Philosophy of Language. 
His first book, Zhuangzi and Early Chinese Philosophy: Vagueness, Transformation and Paradox, was published by Ashgate in 2004, and has been reprinted with Routledge, 2018. His second book, An Introduction to Daoist Philosophies, was published by Columbia University Press in 2013. His third book, Philosophers of the Warring States: A Sourcebook in Chinese Philosophy, is an anthology of his original translations of the ancient Chinese philosophical texts, together with philosophical commentaries. It was co-authored with Dr. Kurtis Hagen, former Dept. Chair at SUNY Plattsburgh.
Dr. Coutinho has presented papers at the East West International Philosophers Conference, the Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy, the American Philosophical Association, and the Association for Asian Studies. He has published articles in Philosophy East and West and The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, and has written the entries on âLieziâ and âZhuangziâ for the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

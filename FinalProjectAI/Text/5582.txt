goldwein scores gold win for men’s tennis





Freshman Wayne Mitchel reaches in front of senior Jamie Goldman to return a shot in their No. 3 doubles match. The duo lost the close match in a tiebreaker, but both dominated their singles matches, limiting their opponents to a total of three games.


With the score 4-3 in favor of King’s, sophomore Robbie Goldwein and junior Brian Wernick had to prove why they are Mules’ No. 1 and No. 2 rackets. 

And both of them lived up to expectations, clinching huge three-set wins for the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team, which registered a 5-4 triumph against visiting Monarchs.

Already with experience in this type of situation, Wernick turned in a fabulous comeback performance after falling 6-4 in the first set. 
With his focus back for the remainder of the match, the Reading, Pa., native took the second and the third sets, 6-4 and 6-1. 

Less than a week ago, Wernick recorded a crucial victory at No. 2 singles to bring the Mules a 5-4 victory over Moravian.

Wernick’s match over, Goldwein was still fighting for the win at No. 1 on the adjacent court. 

After Muhlenberg’s first racket exchanged 6-4 sets with Nick Hojsack, the team success was on the line in the third. Goldwein came out victorious in the 
decisive set, 6-4, in a sizzling showcase spectacle by the two players.

The Mules claimed their fourth consecutive win and are riding on their longest winning run since the 2003 season. The team also hasn’t suffered a defeat to non-conference opposition in eight successive matches.

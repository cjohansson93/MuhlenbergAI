Commencement Update: July 21, 2020



A message from President Harring to the Class of 2020 and their Families

Tuesday, July 21, 2020

Dear Class of 2020 and Families,
It is with a heavy heart that I share the Collegeâs decision to cancel the in-person October 17-18 commencement for the Class of 2020. We based this decision on the guidance from the CDC and American College Health Association and the current state restrictions on the number of people who can gather in either indoor or outdoor settings. The state policy restricts outside gatherings to no more than 250 individuals. Inside events are limited to no more than 25 people with exceptions for in-person instruction and campus dining where physical distancing is possible.
We hoped that the pandemic would have taken a different course. While the Lehigh Valley has not seen significant surges in the number of cases, elsewhere in Pennsylvania there has been an increase in infection rates. Thus, the state restrictions have not been lifted. We have already begun to alter plans and modify Alumni Weekend to be held virtually and are cancelling our annual fall family weekend. No large-scale events are being hosted in person on campus. 
We were cautiously optimistic in continuing with plans for an on-campus event in the fall, though with the continuously changing landscape of the pandemic, we are not able to predict when we can safely host all members of the Class of 2020 and their families for a large-scale event on campus. I realize this is incredibly disappointing news. I also recognize that many of you may have already begun to make travel plans and apologize for any inconveniences caused by this change.
We are committed to including as many of the traditional elements of the commencement ceremony as possible through a virtual platform on Sunday, October 18, the postponed date for the campus ceremony. We recognize the importance of having an opportunity for the members of the class to come together to celebrate in person and, circumstances permitting, will plan to hold a celebration event on campus during Alumni Weekend in the fall of 2021. 
We hope to share the details of the October virtual ceremony in early September. Thank you for your patience and understanding of the need for this change in plans. The Muhlenberg Class of 2020 is very special to our community. We want to honor and recognize your accomplishments in the fall and again when the class can be together on campus. 
Sincerely,Kathleen HarringPresident

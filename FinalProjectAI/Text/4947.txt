faust breaks record in 2010 track opener



The Muhlenberg track and field teams opened their 2010 seasons indoors at the Golden Bear Invitational at Kutztown, and senior Alex Faust
got off to a flying start.

Faust pole vaulted 12-1¼, breaking the school and Centennial Conference record she set last year. Faust also hit the NCAA provisional qualifying
standard and took the early lead atop the Division III ranked performance list. She narrowly missed in her attempt to clear the automatic qualifying
height of 12-7½.

In addition to her record vault, Faust finished second in the 55 meters, just seven one-hundredths of a second off her school record, and ran the
lead leg on the 4x400 relay team that came within five seconds of the school record.

The Mules’ other NCAA qualifier last indoor season, senior Jennifer Lynch, also rang up a pair of impressive performances for the first
meet of the season. She won the 3,000 meters with a time that was two-and-a-half seconds short of the school record she set last year, and her time
of 2:22.71 in the 800 meters broke her personal record by nearly two seconds.

The veterans picked up where they left off, and the freshmen started off on the right foot. Tara Keegan placed fourth in the triple jump and
sixth in 400 and long jump, and Amanda Brennan was third in the 55 hurdles, sixth in the triple jump, seventh in the high jump and eighth in
the long jump. Brennan was one of two Mule freshmen to qualify for the finals in the 55 hurdles; Mallory Davis posted the third-best prelim time.

Sophomore Nicolette Miller led a Muhlenberg 1-2 finish in the 1,000 meters. Sophomore Kimberlee Yalango, who was second, also anchored the
4x400 relay team.

For the men, junior Matt Lauletti won the 3,000 meters. Sophomore Peter Rice ran a 51.95 in the 400 meters (close to his personal record
of 51.78) and anchored the second-place 4x400 relay. Sophomore Marc Brookland’s distance in the triple jump was just five inches off his 
personal best and 13 inches from the school record.

O War
March 28-31, 2019
Part Two of Holly Cateâs adaptationof Shakespeareâs War of the Roses tetralogyDirector: Troy DwyerChoreographer: Jeffrey Peterson
Holly Cateâs fierce, unblinking adaptation picks up where it left off at the end of last seasonâs Glory â with the Duke of Suffolkâs head in a box. Tensions that simmered under the surface threaten to boil over into outright civil war. The king is weak, his rivals greedily eye the throne, and the commoners are rising, even if they donât quite know why.
War is coming â and when it arrives we find that being in war is like looking at your moral compass in a funhouse mirror. You may make it out alive, but will the world ever look the same?
Shakespeareâs account of Englandâs bloodiest chapter is visceral and incisive, and Cateâs adaptation brings to the narrative a terrifying urgency, and an uncomfortable proximity to the violence of war.
For mature audiences.
Thursday, Mar. 28, 8 p.m.Friday, Mar. 29, 8 p.m.Saturday, Mar. 30, 2 & 8 p.m.Sunday, Mar. 31, 2 p.m.

Be Boundless with Us
There was never a more exciting time to give to the College than now - during Boundless: The Campaign for Muhlenberg.
In the midst of a liberal arts renaissance, Muhlenberg is poised to lead the way. With your help, students will have more opportunities for integrative learning, they will experience enhanced services through the career center and increased access to financial aid. And, they will have newly renovated or brand new buildings on campus to house expanded academic offerings such as a maker space for budding entrepreneurs.
Learn more about how you can be boundless with us here or reach out at any time with a question about how you can best support our students.

Pair of Mule XC runnersearn regional honors





Mayden is the first Mule woman to be named all-region since 2008.





Torphy is looking for his second trip to the national meet in two years.




It was a youth movement for the Muhlenberg women, while the Mule men were paced by a pair of veterans as both teams finished in the top 15 at the NCAA Mideast Regional meet hosted by Carnegie Mellon.

Sophomore Samantha Mayden and freshman Nicole Cronin both ran top-40 times to help the Mule women finish 12th out of 45 teams.

Muhlenbergs mens squad got a career best 20th-place finish from senior Bobby Torphy, while junior Will Lowery came in 50th as the Mules beat two teams they finished behind at the Centennial Conference meet (Swarthmore and Gettysburg) to end the day ninth out of 47 complete teams.

Torphys time of 25:50.1 earned him all-region honors for the second year in a row and also put him contention for a possible bid to next weeks NCAA Championships. 

He finished eighth among runners not from the two teams (Haverford and Dickinson) that automatically qualified for the NCAA Championships. If the NCAA awards an at-large bid to third-place Carnegie Mellon, Torphy would move up to sixth among runners from non-qualifying teams. The top seven in each region receive invitations to the national meet. The at-large bids will be announced on Sunday afternoon. 

Mayden, meanwhile, also earned all-region honors for her 27th-place finish. She finished the 6-kilometer Coopers Lake Campground course in 23:19.9, less than six seconds ahead of Cronin, who just missed out on all-region honors by finishing 36th.

The Centennial Conference showed its strength once again by placing the top two teams in each race. Haverford took the mens team title, followed by Dickinson. Johns Hopkins won the womens race, while the Red Devils once again finished runners-up.

Both the Mule men and women beat Moravian to give Muhlenberg a one-point lead (4-3) in the Matte Award standings heading into the winter sports season.

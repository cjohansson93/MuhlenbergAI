faust, lynch honored by lvaiaw





The LVAIAW luncheon marked the second time this year that Faust (left) and Lynch both came away from an event with awards. Above, they are shown with their
Most Outstanding Performer trophies from the CC Indoor Championships.




Earlier this month, Muhlenberg seniors Alex Faust and Jennifer Lynch were honored at the annual Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW) 
luncheon.

Faust was named Muhlenberg’s Outstanding Athlete. The owner of eight school records in track and field, Faust earned All-America honors in the pole vault at the NCAA Division III
Championships outdoors in 2009 and indoors in 2010. A 14-time Centennial Conference gold medalist, she was named Most Outstanding Performer for field events at the CC
Championships both indoors and outdoors in 2010. Faust is the only athlete in CC history to win same event indoor and outdoors all four years and added four silvers and eight bronzes 
during her career.



Lynch was voted the Outstanding Athlete in women’s track of all the schools in the LVAIAW (Cedar Crest, DeSales, Kutztown, Lafayette, Lehigh, Moravian and Muhlenberg). 
She helped break eight school records on the track in her two years with the program and was named Most Outstanding Performer for track events at the CC Indoor Championships
after winning two gold medals. Lynch competed in the NCAA Indoor Championships each of the last two years and is a provisional qualifier outdoors this season.

Founded in 1978, the LVAIAW promotes women’s sports in the spirit of collegiality among the schools in the area.

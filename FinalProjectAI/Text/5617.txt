three fall teams honored for academics



  



Three Muhlenberg fall sports teams were honored recently by their respective coaches associations for academic and athletic excellence.

The women’s and men’s cross country teams were both named to the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) All-Academic Team.

For a team to be considered for the USTFCCCA All-Academic Team award, it must have competed and compiled a team score at an NCAA Regional Meet.
The team must also have a minimum 3.10 team cumulative grade-point average. A total of 141 women’s teams and 99 men’s squads earned the honor in Division III.

Senior Sara Gearin was one of 203 female student-athletes to make the USTFCCCA All-Academic Team. To be eligible for the award, student-athletes must carry a 
minimum 3.5 cumulative grade-point average and finish in the top 25 percent of the field at their respective NCAA regional meet.  

The Mule field hockey squad was one of 83 in Division III to win the National Field Hockey Coaches Association (NFHCA) National Academic Team Award, which 
recognizes those institutions that achieve a minimum GPA of 3.0 during the first semester of the 2007-08 academic year. 

In addition, seven team members were named to the National Academic Squad, which recognizes those collegiate student-athletes who have achieved a minimum 
cumulative GPA of 3.30 through the first semester of the 2007-08 academic year. Muhlenberg’s honorees were seniors Nikki Rhoads, Lauren Rutt and
Kelly Shetron, juniors Michelle Consiglio and Cara Rothacker and sophomores Tara Cohn and Kristen Sabia.

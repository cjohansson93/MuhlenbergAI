was second with 43 goals and third with 33 ground balls. McGovern ended the regular season tied for second in the CC in points per game and was fourth in assists per game 
and sixth in goals per game. 

The midfielder scored at least one goal in the final 35 games of her career, the second-longest goal-scoring streak in Muhlenberg history.

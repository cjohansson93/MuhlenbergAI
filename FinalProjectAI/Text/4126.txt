Rosen, DeCarle named All-CC




A pair of seniors closed out their Muhlenberg women's lacrosse careers by being earning All-Centennial Conference recognition.

Attacker Danielle Rosen was named to the first team, while defender Lauren DeCarle earned second-team honors.

A two-time all-conference honoree, Rosen (left) ranks second in the conference in points and assists, and third in goals. 

She scored 76 points, the third-highest single-season total in school history, and dished out 28 assists during her senior campaign.

Rosen ended her Mule career second in program history in points (212), fourth in assists (70) and sixth in goals (142). She is the 10th Mule to be named All-CC at least twice.

DeCarle (right) earned the first All-CC honor of her career after leading the Mules, and ranking third in the conference, in draw controls and finishing third on the team in ground balls.

She finished her career fourth in school history with 106 draw controls and added 107 ground balls and 57 caused turnovers.

It's the fifth consecutive season Muhlenberg has had multiple all-conference honorees. The Mules have also had at least one player named All-CC every season since the conference started play in 1994.

Liddic Named to Preseason All-America Team

Although the fall seasons are just about at their halfway points, the winter sports are less than two weeks away from beginning practice. And when
the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team rolls out the balls, it will have a preseason All-American on the floor.

Senior forward Spencer Liddic was named a second-team preseason All-American by Sporting News.

One of two Centennial Conference players named to the second team, Liddic is coming off a tremendous junior campaign in which he was named
to the D3hoops.com all-region first team and was a unanimous All-Centennial Conference selection for the second consecutive year.

Liddic led the CC in scoring (20.4 points per game) and rebounding (9.8 rebounds per game) last winter and broke a 40-year-old school record by scoring 509 points. 
He scored in double figures in all but one game and led the CC with 13 double-doubles. Also a first-team Academic All-American, he will enter his 
senior season 15th on the Mules’ all-time scoring list with 1,221 career points. 

Muhlenberg is scheduled to open the 2011-12 season with a game at Moravian on Tuesday, November 15,
before hosting the 30th Scotty Wood Tournament that weekend.

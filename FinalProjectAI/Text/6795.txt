Women's Tennis Shows Improvement in First Win

Last year, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team lost to Gettysburg for the first time in 12 years, dropping a tough 6-3 match in which two singles matches came down to third-set supertiebreakers.

There was no such drama this year.



The Mules put on an impressive performance, defeating the Bullets 8-1 for their first win of the year. Muhlenberg swept the doubles and lost only 14 games in its five singles wins.

“It’s nice to think that we’ve improved,” said junior Nina Sanders.

Sanders and junior Emily Szulman helped set the tone for the match with a convincing 8-2 win at first doubles.

“I was thrilled because this was our first doubles win [of the year],” said Sanders, who studied abroad in the fall. “This is our third year together and we hope to have a winning record.

“We fed off that energy in our singles matches,” she added. “There was not as much pressure on us.”

Muhlenberg won 8-5 at both second and third doubles. At No. 3, senior Amanda von Taube and junior Gabriela Contino defeated a Bullet duo that won at second doubles in last year’s Muhlenberg match.

Von Taube pulled off a similar turnaround at No. 5 singles, scoring a 6-2, 6-1 victory against a player who defeated her in two close sets (7-5, 6-4) last year.

Sanders and Szulman won at straight sets at the top two singles spots, and sophomores Jennifer Goldberg and Sharen Resnikoff (left) lost a game apiece in winning at No. 3 and No. 4.

The win made for a good start to a long stretch of competition for the Mules. Beginning with the Gettysburg match, they have 12 matches in 25 days, mainly due to weather-related postponements.

 Men's cross country, men's soccer rankings

Football players rank among nations best




As it ascends into the American Football Coaches Association Division III national poll, the Muhlenberg football team is also making its mark on the national statistical rankings as well. Three Mules cracked the top 20 in their respective categories this week.

Chase Nadell leads Muhlenbergs contingent with the lone top-five mark. The reigning Centennial Conference special teams player of the week checks in at fourth in the country in kickoff return average. Nadell has returned eight kickoffs for 263 yards this season, good for an average of 32.88 yards per return. Last week against Johns Hopkins, he returned five kicks for 165 yards.



Fellow special teams ace Chris Hartzell is tied for eighth in Division III in passes defended. The junior cornerback has broken up eight passes this season, for an average of two per game. Hartzell (left) also blocked a punt against Johns Hopkins and deflected the Blue Jays final pass attempt of the game to Kevin Ryan, who grabbed the ball for the game-clinching interception.

Another stalwart of the Mule defense, Patrick McDonough, is ranked 20th in the nation in tackles. The senior linebacker has made 46 stops on the year, an average of 11-and-a-half per game. A first-team All-CC selection a year ago, McDonough (right) is also tied for the conference lead in tackles per game.

Muhlenberg College offers several different types of funding for international students, all of which are grant funds from the College that do not require repayment. All funding is intended to supplement the difference between the cost of a Muhlenberg education and the amount that a family is able to pay.
Tuition and Fees
Need-Based Financial Aid - Timing is crucial in the financial aid process, so please follow these instructions carefully and submit required forms by the published admissions deadlines:

Indicate on your Common Application that you wish to be considered for need-based aid. It is too late to apply for aid after you have been admitted.
Submit the Certification of Finances, which is available in the Student Application Portal.

Financial aid recipients will receive an award for their first academic year, which will be renewable for each of the following three years without submitting additional materials. Your award will be calculated based upon the documentation and information you provided with your admissions application. 
Merit Scholarship - Muhlenberg College is committed to enrolling a diverse and highly qualified student body. In that spirit, we offer a limited number of merit scholarships to the most accomplished international students. Please understand that this is a highly competitive process, so we must receive your completed admissions application by the published deadline in order to consider you for a merit award. No additional documents are required to apply for merit funding.
Talent Grant - $1,000 to $4,000  grants are awarded on the basis of audition or portfolio to students in performing arts or visual arts who intend to continue performing during college (not necessary to major in Music, Theater Arts, Dance  or Art; simply must contribute to performing groups at the College while at Muhlenberg). Find more information on applying for a talent grant here. 
Additional International Scholarship Programs
Muhlenberg College is pleased to partner with these organizations to provide opportunities for their scholars to enroll in the College:
SHE-CAN - An organization that empowers low-income young women from post-conflict countries to become leaders. There are currently 25 partner institutions in the SHE-CAN Scholarship Coalition, providing $15 million in scholarship funds since 2011. Muhlenberg provides one full scholarship per year to a SHE-CAN scholar who has been vetted through the organizationâs application process.
The Next Genius - A foundation that partners with US colleges and universities to offer full and partial tuition scholarships to outstanding Indian high school students. Founded in 2014, Next Genius is the largest undergraduate abroad scholarship fund in India. The program and its partners have awarded over $18 million in scholarships to over 212 students.

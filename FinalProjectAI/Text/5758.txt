johnson, grube win cc honors



 
Seniors Matt Johnson and Jordon Grube of the Muhlenberg football team were honored by the Centennial Conference for their contributions to the Mules’
title-clinching 31-7 win at Ursinus.

Johnson (right) was named co-offensive player of the week after catching eight passes (one short of the CC record for a tight end) for 116 yards (two short of the school record
for a tight end) and two touchdowns. He caught a 57-yard pass in the first quarter to give Muhlenberg a 14-0 lead, then capped the scoring with a 25-yard grab in the third.
It was the second straight two-TD game for Johnson, who needs two receptions to break the school record for catches by a tight end in a season.

Grube (left), the special teams player of the week, made one of the biggest plays of the game when he recovered his own onside kick after the Mules’ first touchdown. Two plays later, Johnson caught his first
touchdown pass. Grube also was perfect on his five kicks, converting four extra points and a field goal.

The CC weekly honor was the second for both Johnson and Grube; ironically, both previously were recognized as freshmen – Johnson (then a running back) after
running for 131 yards and three touchdowns in a 21-0 shutout of Gettysburg and Grube for kicking three field goals in a 9-6 win at Johns Hopkins. Johnson is the third
different Muhlenberg player to be named CC offensive player of the week the last three weeks.

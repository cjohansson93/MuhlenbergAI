Women's Soccer Falls in CC First Round
 Thursday, November 1, 2012







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team did just about everything right in its home Centennial Conference playoff game against Swarthmore, except for putting the
ball in the net.

The Mules had numerous chances but could not capitalize and suffered a season-ending 1-0 loss. The fifth-seeded Garnet advances to the semifinals to take on top-seeded
Johns Hopkins on Saturday.

Swarthmore scored with just 15 seconds left in the first half when a rebound of a saved shot was put in before the Mules could clear the ball away.

Muhlenberg came out on fire in the second half and applied considerable pressure, taking seven corner kicks and getting off several dangerous crosses in the first 20
minutes. 

For the game, the Mules had advantages of 18-8 in shots (9-2 in the second half) and 12-4 in corner kicks. Twice, Garnet defenders cleared the ball off the line to
prevent goals.

The game was the last for the four Muhlenberg seniors, Alyssa Meola (left), Jillian Moretto, Maggie Neary and
Natalie Wizel.

The Mules ended the season with a record of 8-9-2, with seven of their losses coming by a 1-0 final. Their last 16 games all ended in shutouts.

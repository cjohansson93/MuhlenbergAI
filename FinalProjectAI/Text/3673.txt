Season Preview
Men’s basketball defensiveabout 2010-11 season





Liddic finished 20th in Division III with 10.4 rebounds per game last season.




Losing four of its top six scorers would put any team in a bind. Add to that a roster that features 11 underclassmen and the task becomes even more daunting.

But instead of fretting over who is going to step up and produce the lost points, the Muhlenberg mens basketball team has a different plan. With a roster heavy on youth, the Mules want to make life miserable for opposing offenses.

So at every practice this season, the six upperclassmen have preached giving maximum effort each play and being aggressive at both ends of the floor.

And according to senior captain David Gwyn, with Mondays season opener against Lehigh Valley rival Moravian just a few days away, the younger players have done a good job of grasping those concepts. 

Were bringing a lot of intensity in practice, Gwyn said. Its going to be important for us to bring intensity every night. We cant just rely on talent or playing well offensively; well need to bring a lot of intensity on the defensive end and create some turnovers.

Were going to have to work hard because were not going to be near the top of our league if we cant do that every night.






Gwyn is a key part of Muhlenberg's press.



While the Mules lost more than half of their offensive output from last seasons 13-14 squad, they do welcome back one of the best players in Centennial Conference, as well as the region.

Junior forward Spencer Liddic finished in the top seven in the CC in scoring (7th), rebounding (1st) and blocks (2nd) en route to earning first-team all-conference and third-team all-region honors.

The 6-foot-5 post player finished his sophomore season with 466 career rebounds, the most by a player after two seasons in CC history. He also finished with a conference-high 13 double-doubles.

While Liddic pounds away on the inside, senior guard Evan Tozer gives the offense a potent perimeter shooter.

The senior captain finished fifth in the CC with 45 three-pointers last year and averaged 8.0 points a game. And with coach Scott McClary back for his second season on the bench, Tozer said the returning players are a lot more comfortable with his system and coaching style. 

Coming back we know what to expect and everythings coming to us quicker, Tozer said. We already know most of the sets, so we can work on making them better. We do not have to learn from square one like we did last year.

Matt OHara and Justin Greenstone join Liddic and Tozer as returning starters. 

OHara was forced into the starting point guard role as a freshman and responded well. He finished the season with a team-high 68 assists and 21 steals. He also finished in the top 10 in the conference in assist-to-turnover ratio.



Greenstone started 11 of the final 12 games of the season and is a strong on-the-ball defender. Sophomore guard Rob Berish also provided quality minutes off the bench last season, playing in all 27 games and averaging 4.4 points per contest.

Add to that nucleus what Gwyn called a talented group of underclassmen, and the Mules have high expectations for this season.

After finishing 10-8 in the conference, the Mules picked up their first postseason road win in nine years when they beat Ursinus in the first round of the CC playoffs. Muhlenberg then went on the road again and fell to eventual national quarterfinalist Franklin & Marshall.

But this team wants more, Gwyn said. While a large portion of the roster might be considered inexperienced, he said the group has really started to play well as a unit. And thats important, he added, because while the Mules may feature one or two potential standouts, it will take solid efforts from the entire lineup to achieve their goals.

We want to win the league. I dont really think theres anyone in our league whose goal is different than that, Gwyn said. I think we have the talent; we have some great players coming back. We lost a lot, but I think we gained a lot in terms of chemistry and out teamwork.

It took a week or two to figure out everyones talents and how everyone fit in, but I think were starting to figure each other out and work well together.

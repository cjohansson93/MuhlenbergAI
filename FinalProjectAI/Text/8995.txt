STUDY ABROAD Studying abroadâwhether for a full year, for a semester, or as part of a short-term program during the summerâcan be a central component of any History majorâs or minorâs program at Muhlenberg. Most, if not all, study abroad programs include courses that, with prior approval, can count towards the requirements of the History major or minor program. Indeed, in past years, History students have completed programs in many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East; others have participated in the Lutheran College Washington semester program in Washington DC. More important, as those who have completed such programs can testify, studying off-campus gives one a hands-on familiarity with other places, peoples, and cultures that is invaluable to understanding the past and present of the interconnected world we live in today. Studying abroad offers a chance to see and live history around the globe.

women’s basketball sneaks past desales


Lauren Boyle had her shooting shoes on for Muhlenberg’s women’s basketball game against DeSales.

The junior scored a 



Boyle is averaging a team-best 17.6 points per game.



game-high 22 points, including four tie-breaking free throws in the final minute, to lead the Mules past their Lehigh Valley rivals, 67-63.

Boyle was playing with a new pair of 

sneakers after suffering a blowout during practice earlier in the week. Suffering a blowout was also the fate of the first four opponents for the Bulldogs, who came in with an average margin of victory of 19.5 points.

“DeSales came in 4-0 and they have great chemistry; they’ve been playing together for a while,” said Boyle. “We’re a young team so even though this was a non-conference game, it was a good win for us.”

The game was tied eight times in the second half, the last at 63-63. With 50 seconds left, Boyle was fouled while attempting a jump shot in the lane and sank two free throws to put Muhlenberg (3-2) ahead to stay.

DeSales missed a shot and a putback at the other end, and sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley chased down the rebound with 30 seconds on the clock. The Bulldogs had only three team fouls up to that point, and until they fouled Boyle for their seventh only 14.1 seconds remained.

Boyle made both ends of the one-and-one to provide the final margin of victory, giving the Mules their third straight win against DeSales.

Muhlenberg went on a 12-2 run that featured a pair of O’Malley three-pointers to open up a 10-point lead late in the first half. The Mules were up by seven at halftime, but the Bulldogs opened the second half on a 9-2 run to draw even and set the stage for a thrilling finish.

DeSales took its biggest lead, at 47-42, with 12:37 to play, but Muhlenberg came right back to tie the score on junior 
Kaitlin Strumph’s putback of a missed free throw. 

The teams were tied again at 55 at the 5-minute mark before Muhlenberg took a six-point lead with back-to-back three-pointers by O’Malley and freshman 
Kelly McKeon, the latter coming at the shot-clock buzzer. The Bulldogs responded with back-to-back threes of their own, knotting the score at 61.

With the shot clock winding down again, McKeon hit a jumper with 1:39 left, giving the Mules a 63-61 lead. DeSales tied the score with 1:10 on the clock.

Boyle finished with team highs of five assists and six rebounds to go along with her 22 points. O’Malley and McKeon had solid games off the bench, with O’Malley scoring 14 points and McKeon recording nine points, six rebounds, three assists and three steals.

men’s basketball learns lessons


Two days after the end of the final exam period for the first semester, the Muhlenberg mens basketball team went 




Junior Evan Tozer led Muhlenberg with 13 points.


back to school and learned some important lessons in a 72-61 loss at Elizabethtown.

One was that the Mules will have to step up their game against high-quality competition. After winning four in a row against teams with a combined record of 5-26, Muhlenberg faces the other three 2009 Centennial Conference semifinalists in its first nine days back in 2010.

Another is that continuing to play hard pays off. The Mules, who trailed the Blue Jays 20-6 midway through the first half and by 13 (40-27) at halftime,
got back in the game with exceptional defense.
Down 49-34 five minutes into the second half, Muhlenberg went on an 11-2 run to cut the gap to six. Elizabethtown (8-3) scored the next six points, however, and maintained a comfortable lead the rest of the way.

And last but not least, its hard to beat anybody when you commit turnovers. The Mules had a 49-31 rebounding advantage and held Elizabethtown to 34.3-percent shooting (26.5 percent in the second half) but turned the ball over 34 times against the pressure defense of the Blue Jays.

Senior Peter Barnes notched his fourth double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore Spencer Liddic just missed a double-double, scoring all 12 of his points in the second half and adding nine rebounds.

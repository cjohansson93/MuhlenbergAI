Visiting Committees to Academic Departments
Overarching Goals Visiting Committees provide an opportunity for reflection and discussion aimed at strengthening our academic program. Departments will benefit from multiple perspectives and receive informed feedback about their curricular objectives. The Visiting Committee process is very much a partnership between the department and the members of the Committee. The spirit of the visits should be lively and informal â a shared concern for the work of the department will animate the discussions and create a collaborative environment within which the visit can take place. Visiting Committees serve four primary purposes:

to provide a regular opportunity for self-assessment combined with the fresh perspective of an external review;
to examine the objectives of the department and the effectiveness with which the departmentâs program is meeting those objectives;
to help the department articulate its strengths and challenges;
to provide a written report following the visit that includes recommendations for departmental development and progress.

Composition Visiting Committees are usually composed of two to three members of the Board of Observers and two faculty members from other liberal arts colleges. The department should provide a list of at least five faculty members from other institutions. Based on the first cycle of Observer Visits, faculty from institutions with comparable resources and similar educational missions make the best team members. The President will select one of the faculty members to serve as the team leader based on recommendations from the department.
The Campus Visit The Committee prepares for its visit by reviewing briefing materials prepared by the department in consultation with the Provost. During the Committeeâs visit to campus, committee members meet with the President, Provost and all department members, as well as with other faculty and staff connected to the department, representative students, and additional administrators if appropriate. These meetings are intended to be collaborative and conversational in tone and format.
Typical Schedule Day One Dinner with the President, Provost, and department chair Day Two Breakfast: committee meets to plan day, review questions Morning: meetings with all departmental faculty; review of additional material Lunch time: working lunch with representative students Afternoon: meetings with other faculty and staff directly involved with the program Dinner: informal dinner and discussion with department members

Day Three Committee breakfast and working session to review and outline the Committeeâs findings and recommendations. Drafting assignments are determined and the basic content and structure of the report are agreed upon. Lunch with Provost and Associate Dean for Institutional Assessment to review the preliminary report
After the visit concludes, the Visiting Committee Team Leader, in cooperation with the other members of the Committee, prepares a report addressing the questions described in the guidelines below. Normally this report is submitted to the President within four weeks of the visit. The President and Provost will share the report with the department. The department then has three weeks to prepare a brief response to the report.
The report and response are then submitted to the Educational Policies and Faculty Affairs Committee (EPFAC) of the Board of Trustees for its comments. Copies are also sent to all Trustees. The Observers who were members of the Visiting Committee and the department chair may join EPFAC for a discussion of the report.
Guidelines for Department Self-Study Reports: Second Cycle
The department should prepare a self-study report for the visiting committee that will give the committee information to help it assess the effectiveness of the department in fulfilling its mission and to allow it to provide suggestions for departmental development. The department should feel free to include material that will highlight issues the department believes will be useful to discuss with the visiting committee. Departments should feel free to use or modify information from their previous self-study report as relevant for the current self-study.
Sample Outline of Self-Study Report

Progress on Recommendations from Previous Visiting Committee Report Departments should review the previous visiting committee report and provide a brief update addressing the status of recommendations in the report.
Curriculum Describe the curriculum and give a brief history and rationale for recent revisions. Include syllabi in a separate document box.

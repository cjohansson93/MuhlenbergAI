The Muhlenberg softball team completed its trip to Florida with a complete team effort.


The Mules snapped a five-game losing streak by beating Northwestern (Minn.), 13-2, and DeSales, 9-0, in a pair of games stopped short of seven innings due to the eight-run rule. And they won in every facet of the game:

• Fielding – The Mules (3-5) did not commit an error in the two games, while their opponents made seven.

• Pitching – Junior starting pitchers Lisa Peluso (left) and Angie Sisco (right) combined to allow only eight hits.

Peluso allowed three hits in four innings in the opener for her first career win. She struck out three and retired the first nine batters she faced before allowing a leadoff double in the fourth. 

Sisco tossed her third career shutout, a five-hitter. She fanned three without walking a batter and allowed only two runners past first base.

• Hitting – The bats, which had been mostly quiet for the previous four games, came alive, scoring multiple runs in seven of the 10 innings.

Junior Devon Barber went 5-for-5 in the two games. She had three of the Mules’ eight stolen bases against Northwestern and hit a pair of doubles in the DeSales game. Sophomore Chelsea Benjamin reached base in six of seven plate appearances and scored three runs vs. DeSales. Sophomore Erica Wenzel went 4-for-4 vs. Northwestern, starting rallies in the first and second innings. 

The one player who hit throughout the trip, sophomore Kelly Kline, continued to swing a big bat, going 2-for-3 with a double and three runs scored vs. Northwestern (she did not play in the second game). She will return to Allentown with a .591 batting average and 1.318 slugging percentage.

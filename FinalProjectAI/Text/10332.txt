In the early 1980s, developing AIDS was a literal death sentence. The award-winning feature-length documentary 5B highlights the first AIDS ward unit in the United States. 
The film tells the inspirational story of everyday heroes, nurses and caregivers who took extraordinary action to comfort, protect and care for their patients. 
Muhlenberg is hosting a virtual talkback session, featuring filmmakers and some of the nurses who helped create the worldâs first Special Care Unit for persons with HIV/AIDS on Friday, February 25, 2â3 p.m. The Zoom link is available here.
Powerful and profoundly moving, 5B is told through first-person testimony of the nurses and caregivers who built Ward 5B in 1983 at San Francisco General Hospital, their patients, loved ones and staff who volunteered to create care practices based in humanity and holistic well-being during a time of great uncertainty. 
The result is an uplifting yet candid and bittersweet monument to a pivotal moment in American history and a celebration of quiet heroes worthy of renewed recognition.
In advance of the discussion with filmmakers, the film is available on a number of streaming platforms, including free of charge on tubitv.com.
5B was commissioned by Johnson & Johnson from UM Studios, Highway 61 Films and Saville Productions, with the filmmakers granted complete editorial control over the documentary. Co-directed by Academy-Award nominee Dan Krauss and Oscar winner Paul Haggis, 5B won the Entertainment Lions Grand Prix and is now part of the Museum of Modern Artâs Permanent Collection.
The presenters for the Muhlenberg event include:

The 2021-2022 Center for Ethics program âPandemic: Response, Resilience, Reflection" continues through April. 
This yearâs theme explores some of the ethical questions that arise when we pause to think about the current global pandemic including: What lessons can be learned from the scientific collaboration on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines? From receiving a vaccine to wearing masks, how has the pandemic exposed the limits and obligations of individual and collective ethical behavior? How should we respond to the ways in which the pandemic has had disparate impacts based on race and class? How do we think about the rationing of care when health systems get overwhelmed?
The 2021-2022 program directors are Chrysan Cronin, associate professor of public health, and Lindsey Nagy, associate professor of economics. The director of the Center for Ethics is Brian Mello, professor of political science.

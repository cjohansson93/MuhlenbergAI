November Community Planning Event
During the November 2016 Community Planning Event, faculty, staff and student leaders participated in an interactive planning process facilitated by an outside consultant.






February Community Planning Event
On Thursday, February 23, 2017, over 100 members of the campus community gathered in the Seegers Union Event Space for the second meeting of the Strategic Planning Group (SPG). This session was to discuss the progress made by the SPG to date and also provide an introduction for the Campus Master Plan. The main topic of this meeting was “campus landscape/space.”
President John I. Williams, Jr. welcomed everyone followed by introductions of the Strategic Planning Committee and the WRT Design Group. Interim Provost Kathy Harring began the meeting with a recap of the November 2, 2016 meeting and an update on the Strategic Plan timeline, which included:

December 2016: SPG refined institutional themes
January 2017: Board provided feedback on revised themes
February 2017: SPG developed initial draft of plan, Trustee Planning Committee provided Feedback, Campus Planning Event held.
March 2017: SPG prepares draft of Plan
April 2017: Draft Plan presented to Board

Participants were seated at tables of eight, with members of the SPG and the WRT group serving as moderators for the exercise. At each table there was a campus map and topics for discussion: Campus Setting, Academic Facilities & Space, Student Life & Space and Residential Life & Space. The exercise was to name Muhlenberg’s assets, then list ideas of how to make improvements.






The Community Planning Event Recap is available to members of our community. The information is identical for both students and faculty/staff.

“We are so pleased that Robert Gerken has accepted our offer to be at the helm of the College’s Campus Safety department,” said Karen Green, dean of students and vice president for student affairs.  “His training and experience leave him poised for great success in our campus community.
Christa Houck, the student representative on the search committee, after speaking with an Albright student said the following, “I think that if we end up with Mr. Gerken, we are going to be a very lucky campus.  He was described as a compassionate, hardworking man who is thoroughly dedicated to his campus.  The Albright students will truly miss this much beloved man.”  Since 2000, Gerken has been the Director of Public Safety for Albright College in Reading, Pa.  Prior to that, he served as Pennsylvania state police officer for 25 years and worked as a licensed private investigator.
He is a graduate of the Pennsylvania State Police Academy and has a B.A. in police science from Alvernia College.  He has extensive training in a variety of issues, including emergency response planning, narcotics investigations, mental health issues of adolescents and other best practices in the field.

âBerg Profs To Take Part In Statewide Housing Study



Muhlenberg College professors Chris Borick, political science, and Karen Pooley, sociology/anthropology, will take part in a statewide housing study sponsored by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. 


	 Friday, August 26, 2005  01:59 PM

Borick and Pooley will be part of a team led by czb LLC, a planning firm out of Alexandria, Virginia. The team will assess housing trends and needs, as well as housing market strength, throughout northeastern Pennsylvania.
The College’s Institute of Public Opinion will conduct surveys of area residents, lenders, realtors and public officials as part of the project.
The Reinvestment Fund (Philadelphia) and the Housing Alliance (with offices in Glenside, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh) are conducting similar work in other parts of the state.
The Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency provides capital for decent, safe and affordable homes and apartments for older adults, persons of modest means and those persons with special housing needs.

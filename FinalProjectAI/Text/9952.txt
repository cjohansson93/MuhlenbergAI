Ellie Escher 
Voice, Soprano
Background
Ellie Escher is a performer/pedagogue who is as passionate about teaching as she is about singing. Ms. Escher holds a Bachelor of Arts in Music (Magna Cum Laude) from Scripps College in Claremont, CA and a Master of Music in Vocal Performance and Pedagogy (with distinction) from Westminster Choir College. While at WCC she studied voice science with Dr. Scott McCoy (Your Voice: An Inside View) and Vocal Pedagogy with Marvin Keenze. She has participated in a wide variety of professional development workshops and seminars ranging from YogaVoiceÂ® with Mark Moliterno to Vocal Health with Dr. Anat Keidar. Ms. Escher has performed regionally as a recitalist, as a principle artist in Opera and Operetta, and as a soloist with the Harmonium Choral Society of Morristown, N.J. She has pursued her passion for early music with the Amherst Early Music festival, studying with early music expert Julianne Baird. A highlight of her journey as a voice teacher came in 2008, when Ms. Escher was one of twelve young teachers selected to participate in the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) Summer Intern program. As an emerging voice teacher mentored by renowned Master Teachers, she was praised for her pedagogical knowledge and comprehensive instructional skill. 
Ms. Escher is also a 200-hour Registered Yoga Teacher, a distinction that has given her voice teaching increased depth. In July 2013 she completed YogaVoiceÂ® Practitioner certification and is now one of a handful of singers/teachers who hold this credential. YogaVoiceÂ® aims to uncover a singerâs most authentic expression through a synthesis of Bel Canto principals of vocal development and Classical Yoga practices, a natural fit for Ms. Escherâs teaching philosophy. Using this technology, Ellie enjoys teaching repertoire ranging from Early Music to Contemporary Music theater, and everything in between. She was recently elected to the board of directors of the Lehigh Valley Chapter of NATS. Most recently, Ellie was hired to be the music director of â21 Chump Street,â the 15 minute musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, as part of the âLove and the Lawâ Muhlenberg Main Stage festival April, 2019.

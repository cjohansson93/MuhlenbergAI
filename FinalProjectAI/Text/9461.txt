Associate Professor Colabroy (left) is congratulated by President John I. Williams Jr.
The Spira Award was established by Joel and Ruth Spira to recognize and inspire excellence in teaching within and beyond the confines of the traditional classroom by supporting superior performance in undergraduate research instruction.
Colabroy's research interests include the chemistry of biological systems and the mechanisms used by enzymes to catalyze complex reactions. She teaches courses in Kitchen Chemistry, Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry, as well as a first-year seminar on coffee.
Colabroy is the co-director of the biochemistry program and the coordinator of student research and scholarship. Colabroy received her bachelorâs degree in chemistry from Messiah College and her Ph.D. in chemistry from Cornell University.

Cross Country Teams Off to Fast Start

Women's Soccer Ties Late, Loses Early in OT


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team scored a dramatic game-tying goal late in regulation, but Wilkes came back with a goal in the first minute of overtime
for a 2-1 win.

The Mules (0-2) trailed for most of the second half after the Lady Colonels scored just 77 seconds after the intermission. But
sophomore Jacelin Muschlitz converted a pass from junior Krissy Fioretti with only two minutes left on the clock to send the
game into overtime.

Wilkes needed only 53 seconds in the extra session to net the winner on a diving header.

The result ended a streak of 17 straight games that ended in shutouts (one way or the other) for the Mules. The last game they played in which both teams scored
was the third game of the 2012 season, a 1-1 tie with Montclair State.

Thanks to several outstanding individual performances, the Muhlenberg cross country teams got their seasons off to a fast start.

Paced by junior Luke Munyan, the men came in fourth out of 14 teams at the Lehigh Invitational, a dramatic improvement over last year’s eighth-place showing at the season-opening event. They finished behind only DeSales among Division III schools, and ahead of Division I programs St. Francis (Pa.), Lafayette and Temple.

The women wound up sixth out of 13 squads, highlighted by Nicki Cronin’s fifth-place finish. The Mules were the first of seven Division III schools to complete the meet, just edging seventh-place Moravian. 

Cronin, who missed this meet with an injury a year ago, was easily the top Division III runner in a field of 137 entrants. The senior co-captain’s time of 23:19 over the 6k course was the second-best finish by a Mule in the history of the event, and marked the third straight year a Muhlenberg woman turned in a top-10 showing. Samantha Mayden was third last year and seventh in 2010. 

Sophomore Melanie Tramontina was the second Division III runner to finish, coming in behind only Cronin in 21st and besting her time from last year by more than a minute. 

Munyan led the men on a hot and humid late morning, coming in fourth among Division III runners with a 21st-place finish. 
Right behind him was freshman Jaryd Flank in 30th and junior Josh Elkan in 31st. Elkan (left) improved his time from last year by more than 47 seconds. Sophomore Stephen Sroka was 36th, and junior Zach Lifman 46th.

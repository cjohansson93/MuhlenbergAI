Chemistry students will be part of the next generation of scientists digging into the worldâs most pressing problems around energy, clean water, nanotechnology and the creation of innovations we canât even begin to imagine.
The excellent slate of instructors within Muhlenbergâs chemistry department are committed to fostering studentsâ inquiry, growth and mastery of the skills needed to be part of these global solutions. Students hone these skills in an interdisciplinary and collaborative scientific environment with opportunities to publish and present findings to the larger scientific community.
Chemistry majors here donât wait long before theyâre immersed in department laboratories, using state-of-the-art equipment for research with faculty or finding answers to their own hypotheses. Exceptional first-year students can be invited to join Project Lab, which offers open-ended experimentation during the second semester of their first year in the majorâa rare opportunity for first-year undergraduate students. By sophomore year, all chemistry students are in their own small organic chemistry class where hands-on intensive lab experience is emphasized. These research opportunities carry on throughout the year with additional opportunities for research available in the summer months.

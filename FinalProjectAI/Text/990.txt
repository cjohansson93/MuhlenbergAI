Introduction
Effective note taking is an essential learning skill for college students to implement before, during, and after class sessions. An organized, efficient system of note taking is important for several reasons.

The faculty member may present material that is not found in your readings, but is critical for you to learn.  Class sessions will make connections to prior knowledge and introduce new material. Your classmates will also make important and interesting points and you will think of new ideas during class sessions.
The information presented within a class session may be used for future assessments and assignments.  Effective note taking will assist in preparing for upcoming class activities.
Actively listening and taking notes during class increases your comprehension and retention of the material. The act of taking notes helps you learn!
Reviewing the notes immediately after class and several times later on adds additional opportunities for clarification and retention.  Frequent review of your notes helps significantly in remembering what you have learned!

 













          Getting Organized
  








Early in the semester, develop a system to keep your notes and other class materials organized.  In addition to your notes, you will need to be able to easily locate the class syllabus, handouts, readings, and assignments.  You may want to integrate your notes and other materials by date, topic, or another method. Some professors will organize and distribute these materials electronically via Canvas, while others will provide you with hard copies.  Your organizational system will vary depending on your preferences and the format and demands of each class.

If your class materials are mostly on paper, you can use 3-ring binders, notebooks, and/or folders.  Schedule some time each week to check your bag and desk for stray papers and file them away. You also may need to print out any materials distributed electronically that you need or prefer to have in hard copy.
If you organize your materials electronically, you can create folders on your computer, utilize note taking apps and software, and/or use cloud-based systems, such as Google Docs.  You may want to consider scanning or taking clear pictures of any papers or notes you get in hard copy, to ensure that they are with the rest of your class materials when you need them. Some professors limit computers in class or want you to have hard copies of materials in class, so you may need to have some systems for organizing papers as well. 







          Before Class
  









Check your syllabus for clues (Is there a lecture/discussion topic indicated? How does the topic relate to the course description/objectives and previous topics?)


Look over your notes from the previous class.


Complete reading and other assignments actively.  (See this handout from the Muhlenberg College Academic Resource Center about reading strategies!)


Preview any materials that the professor has posted (PowerPoint slides, video clips, etc.).


Make notes about any questions you have.







          During Class
  










Put a date and topic heading on the top of each page.


Leave space for questions and clarifications when you are reviewing later.


Highlight anything your instructor implies will be on a test or emphasizes through tone of voice, verbal cues, or repetition.


Put a question mark next to anything that needs clarification.


Put ideas in your own words, so they make sense to you.    


Write the main ideas and just enough detail that the ideas make sense.  Donât try to transcribe everything! Use short phrases, abbreviations, and symbols where you can.


If you fall behind, stop and leave a space on the page.  Listen to get caught up and start taking notes again at that point.  Check in with a classmate later to get the missing information.


Considerations for discussion-based classes:


â Write down the QUESTION being discussed.
â Try concept mapping, since discussions arenât always sequential.
â Listen for themes, issues, relationships, definitions, and the âbig picture.â
â Pay attention to ideas the professor expands upon, repeats, or emphasizes.






          After Class
  









Schedule time for several brief, active reviews of your notes to improve retention and recall. 

â Within 24 hours
â Before the next class session
â Within the week
â Within the month or before an exam

Connect with a classmate to compare notes and discuss the material.
Visit your professor during office hours to ask questions.
Ideas for review activities:

â Fill in missing information, highlight important information, and clarify anything that seems confusing. 
â Write out questions based on the notes.
â Compare the information to what you already know.  If possible, include page numbers from the readings that support/refute ideas discussed in class. 
â Predict potential exam questions. 
â Summarize information and connect it to the âbig pictureâ of the class.
â Reflect on and record your reaction to points in the discussion.






          Common Note-taking Methods
  








You will develop your own methods of taking notes, depending on your preferences and the type of class youâre taking.  Here are some guidelines to get you started.
This video from Crash Course covers various note-taking methods including outlining, the Cornell Method, and mind mapping. 
Cornell Method
The Cornell Method is a systematic and simple method for note taking that breaks the note page into three sections to allow for organized recording and review.  You can use this method while reading your texts or taking lecture notes. Use the largest section on the right to record notes in the way that works best for you.  Use the cue section at the left to pull out main ideas, questions, prompts, and key points. Use the summary section at the bottom to summarize the main points after class.
Cornell Note Taking Template
Cornell Notes Example
Outlining
This is a straightforward way of organizing main ideas, subpoints, and supporting ideas logically.  To use this method, record main ideas to the far left of the page. Indent more specific information underneath, and further indent examples.
Outlining Example
Mind Mapping
This is a way of organizing information visually.  Write the main idea or question in the center of the page, and connect key words and ideas around it to represent relationships.  This method makes it easier to use pictures or colors in representing ideas.
Mind Mapping Example
Charting
Charting is a good strategy for courses that require comparison/contrast of specific dates, places, people, events, importance, and relationships.

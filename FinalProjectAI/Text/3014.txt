Volleyball Comes Back for Split; Cross Country Gets CC Preview


Volleyball



It took the Muhlenberg volleyball team until its sixth set of the day to break on top, but that was enough for the Mules to earn a split of their home tri-match with McDaniel and Wilkes.

Muhlenberg (4-7) was swept by McDaniel in its first Centennial Conference match of the season and trailed Wilkes before rolling in the third set, 25-10. The Mules then took the fourth, 25-20, and the fifth, 15-8, coming back from a 2-0 deficit to win for the first time since 2004.

Senior Brittany Williams recorded five of her season-high 16 kills in the decisive fifth set. Middles Jackie Price and Jennifer Seeba recorded 15 kills apiece. Freshman Bryn Baker had 52 assists and 17 digs, and senior Christina Cangelosi notched 32 digs.

Cangelosi had 24 digs in the McDaniel match.

Cross Country



The Muhlenberg cross country teams got to measure themselves against four other Centennial Conference teams and fared quite well at the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational.

Junior Bobby Torphy finished an impressive ninth out of 182 runners in the “long” 8.1K race for the men. On the women’s side, junior Kate Mahoney also placed in the top 10, coming in 10th out of 121 in the 6K.

The Mules did not have a team score because scores were based on fielding a complete team in both the long and short races. Almost all the Muhlenberg men ran in the long race, and the women did not field a complete team in either segment.

The last two seasons the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team needed a second-half comeback to defeat McDaniel.

This year? Not so much.

The Mules (4-2, 1-0) netted four goals in the first half and added a fifth late in the second to defeat the Green Terror 5-0 in their Centennial Conference opener.




Miller recorded the third multi-goal game of her young career.





Sophomore Meghan O’Grady scored Muhlenberg’s first two goals in the early going. O’Grady beat a defender and buried a shot into the upper left corner in the 12th minute, then scored off a rebound on a corner kick in the 26th.

Junior Lauren Petri picked up an assist on O’Grady’s second goal, then got another just over two minutes later when she sent a cross to sophomore Nicolette Miller, who tapped it in for a goal.

Miller scored again at the 32:00 mark, this time heading in a cross from senior Christina O’Grady.

Freshman Natalie Wizel added the fifth and final goal with less than two minutes to play, again on a cross by Christina O’Grady. The goal was the first of Wizel’s career.

The Mules’ defense shut down the Green Terror (1-5, 0-1) offense, holding it to zero shots on goal. Muhlenberg outshot McDaniel 30-6 for the game.

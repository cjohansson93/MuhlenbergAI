Football Holds on to Beat Susquehanna
 Saturday, October 4, 2014 - page 2







					 



After scoring touchdowns each of the last two weeks, the defensive players on the Muhlenberg football team played the role of setup artist instead.


The defense recorded turnovers on two of its first three plays and freshman Max Cepeda rushed for a career-high 150 yards as the Mules football team escaped with a 24-20 win at Susquehanna.

Muhlenberg (4-1, 3-1) jumped out to an early 21-0 lead heading into halftime and withstood a late push by Susquehanna (0-5, 0-3) to seal the victory. 


The Mule defense wasted no time making its first big play of the game. 
On the first defensive snap, junior Kyle Ruiz (right) forced a fumble, setting up the Mules at the Crusaders’ 18-yard line. Cepeda then took four straight handoffs to punch in the first touchdown of the day.

On the next possession it would take Muhlenberg’s defense just two plays to leave its next imprint on the game. Junior Matt Pagano rose to the occasion this time, picking off a long pass and giving the Mules possession in enemy territory for the second time in three defensive plays.

Sophomore quarterback Nick Palladino connected with senior tight end Michael Long for a 28-yard score four plays later. The Mules led 14-0 with a little more than half of the first quarter still remaining.


After Ruiz brought down two sacks for 21 yards and a Crusader punt on the next possession, Muhlenberg went on its longest drive of the day. The Mules mixed up the run and the pass to travel 71 yards on 12 plays, culminating with Cepeda’s second 1-yard touchdown run of the game.

The Mules took the 21-0 lead into the locker room, but the second half started with scores on each of the first three possessions. Susquehanna started the period with a long touchdown drive, cutting the lead to 21-7. Muhlenberg would respond with a 51-yard drive made up of nine Cepeda rushes and a 14-yard pass from Palladino to sophomore Ryan Delaney, capped off by a 25-yard field goal by senior Connor Winter. 



The Crusaders marched down on their next possession and put up another seven points, setting up a 24-14 Muhlenberg lead as the teams went to the fourth quarter. The Mules held Susquehanna to two field goals on consecutive trips to the red zone in the final quarter to bring the score to 24-20. 

A fourth-down stop with 1:42 left in the game let the Mules drain the clock to 29 seconds with no timeouts left for the home team. Muhlenberg defused any last-ditch efforts by the Crusaders, ending the game when senior Khiry Hughes batted down a Hail Mary pass for his third breakup of the game.

Ruiz was the defensive standout on the day, collecting 13 tackles (11 solo), six for loss, three sacks and a forced fumble. 

Palladino completed 20 of his 31 passes for 183 yards and a touchdown and has now attempted 161 passes this season without an interception. Senior wide receiver Cody Geyer had a game-high seven catches for 57 yards and Long finished with three grabs for 41 yards and a touchdown. 

The defense allowed only 46 passing yards to a Susquehanna team that came in averaging 244.5 yards per game through the air. Junior Lenny Smith
recorded nine tackles, while senior Ian Gimbar had eight, including a sack.

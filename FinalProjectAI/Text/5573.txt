men’s tennis wins another close one





Wernick is tied for the team lead in singles wins with a 6-5 record this spring.



The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team is establishing itself as a close-match specialist after its fourth 5-4 triumph on the season. This time the victim was visiting Franklin & Marshall, which had identical Centennial Conference record (2-4) prior to the match.
 
The Mules haven’t lost an encounter that has been decided by one point, this season. Junior Brian Wernick has played a pivotal role in three of the four 
dramatic victories and so was the case against the Diplomats.

Muhlenberg had just tied the score at four after coming back from a 2-1 deficit in the doubles matches. Wernick was in the middle of the second set against 
Brett Joseph after clinching a grueling 7-6 decision in the first.

Vigorously supported by his teammates, the Reading, Pa., native pulled out a 7-5 win to bring the victory to the Mules, who bounced back from an 8-1 setback to 
Washington on Sunday.

Freshman Wayne Mitchel and senior Jamie Goldman were double winners for Muhlenberg. Their partnership resulted in an emphatic 8-0 triumph at No. 3 doubles. 
In the singles matches, Mitchel won in three sets at No. 5, while Goldman was a straight-sets victor at No. 6.

The Mules achieved their third conference win on the season, thus accumulating more league victories than each of the last four campaigns.

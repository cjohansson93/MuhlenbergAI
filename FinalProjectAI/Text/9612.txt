Moodyâs reaffirms Muhlenbergâs bond rating 


Moodyâs Investors Service has re-affirmed Muhlenberg Collegeâs A1 rating on its Series of 2017 College Revenue Bonds, issued through the Lehigh County General Purpose Authority, which mature in 2037.

âMuhlenberg College has always been vigilant about its finances,â said Kent Dyer, the Collegeâs chief business officer and treasurer. âWe are pleased to receive this recognition from a highly respected third party.â
According to Moodyâs, the A1 rating reflects the strength of Muhlenbergâs unrestricted liquidity position, which provides operating flexibility and a strong cushion relative to debt. The rating also incorporates the college's prudent financial management, which produces consistently solid operating performance providing for strong debt affordability and resources for strategic investment.
Moodyâs also confirmed that the financial outlook for the College is stable, and affirmed the A1 ratings on the Collegeâs outstanding rated debt. Read more on the Moodyâs website.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential, liberal arts college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City.

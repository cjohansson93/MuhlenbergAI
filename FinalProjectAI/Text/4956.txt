WOMEN’S BASKETBALL wins 2010 debut



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team waited almost a month ... for this??

Two minutes into the Mules’ home game against Johns Hopkins, their first action since December 12, leading scorer Alexandra Chili was 


fouled on a drive to the basket and fell hard to the floor.

“I somehow managed to fall on my knee and my right hipbone,” said Chili. “It was like, welcome back!”

Chili was fine, and so was her team. The 10th-ranked Mules broke away from a tie late in the first half and went on to win, 79-65, behind a game-high 24 points from Chili.

The victory extended Muhlenberg’s winning 

streak to seven games. The Mules (8-1, 6-0)

also have won 28 straight against Centennial Conference opponents and 10 in a row against the Blue Jays, who at one point led the all-time series 17-5.

The game was tied eight times in the first 13 minutes, the last time at 22-all. Muhlenberg went ahead for good by scoring the next 

six points, four on a pair of buckets by junior Sheila Cook, both assisted by freshman Alita Zabrecky.

A nine-point halftime lead was down to three early in the second half, but a 12-0 run, capped by a 




Junior Alexandra Berlin broke the 22-22 tie by sinking a jumper with 6:54 left in the first half.



three-point play by Chili, gave the Mules a 15-point bulge with 11 minutes to play. Hopkins (5-6, 3-4) got no closer than seven the rest of the way.

It was a positive return to business for the Mules.

“You could tell we were a little rusty, and we ran out of 


gas at the end, but that’s to be expected,“ remarked Chili. “If we keep playing like this, we'll get better.”

Chili scored 14 of her 24 points in the first half and also had four assists. Cook finished with 14 points on 7-of-12 shooting, and junior Kelly McKeon had an excellent all-around game, with 16 points, a team-leading eight rebounds, five assists and three steals.

The win enabled Muhlenberg to keep pace with Gettysburg, which also kept its perfect CC record intact by winning at Washington. The two teams are scheduled to meet next Thursday at Gettysburg, two days after the Mules host McDaniel in the last of their three straight games against the other three 2009 CC semifinalists.

“It’s an exciting week for us,” said Chili. “We have two big games coming up, and we’re really looking forward to them.”

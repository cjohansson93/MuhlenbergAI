Robin Riley-CaseyAssociate Dean of Studentsand Diversity Initiatives
Director of the Office of Multicultural Life
I am an Ohio native, equity advocate, sports enthusiast and a poet.As the Director of the Office of Multicultural Life (OML) and the Multicultural Center, it is my responsibility to support a just and equitable community at Muhlenberg College. OML serves as a campus-wide resource that facilitates and promotes a learning community of multicultural understanding and exchange through collaboration, dialogue and action.  The Office of Multicultural Life is committed to making a difference in the lives of all students, while advocating explicitly for the concerns of historically underrepresented populations. We welcome your support in this endeavor.

Cristina BraynenAssistant Director of the Office of Multicultural Life
Coming from a racially mixed background and having attended schools in both higher and lower socioeconomic areas, I understand what itâs like to feel like an outsider. I truly believe in the importance of letting everyoneâs voices be heard to foster better growth and learning on both an individual and societal level. Once we can have more difficult conversations and listen eagerly to each otherâs perspectives, weâll be able to see one another as humans rather than superficial labels. My goal on this campus is to continue having those tough conversations with everyone included at the table.

Established in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, Phi Beta Kappa (PBK) is a distinguished fellowship of scholars devoted to liberal education and intellectual pursuits. Muhlenberg College was granted a charter from the national organization in 1967. 

Strict eligibility guidelines, including completion of specific course requirements and placement in the top 15 percent of the graduating class, mean that inductees are among the highest-achieving students at Muhlenberg.

The virtual ceremony included remarks from Assistant Professor of Music Kassandra Hartford and Associate Professor of Mathematics William Gryc. Two scholarships were also awarded to incoming Muhlenberg students from local high schools Dieruff and William Allen.
PBK's advisor, Associate Professor of Biology and Neuroscience Jordanna Sprayberry, addressed this year's inductees.
"One of the most important things about a liberal arts education is that it teaches you that the world operates in contextual truths, rather than absolute truths," said Sprayberry. "Over your time here, you've learned that information does not have a straight right or wrong, it doesn't have any easy answer and, in fact, the most interesting questions require the most work to understand the context that they operate in. In our society today, with global connections that cross complex economic boundaries, physical boundaries, and cultural boundaries, what you've learned here at Muhlenberg is so important."

What is the One Button Studio?
In partnership with the Digital Learning Team, Trexler Library is pleased to announce the availability of the new One Button Studio, a fully-featured digital video production studio that is designed to be both powerful and easy to use, requiring no prior video production experience. The One Button Studio, located on the B-level of Trexler Library diagonally across from the elevator, is available for use by all Muhlenberg faculty, staff, and students.

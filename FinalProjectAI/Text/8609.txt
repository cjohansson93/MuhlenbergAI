Major Requirements
In addition to meeting the general graduation requirements established by the College, students wishing to earn a B.S. degree in environmental science must take at least 14 courses as described in the three lists below.
A. CORE SCIENCES (9 COURSES) These courses provide essential background for all environmental science students.
BIO 160 (Foundations of biological inquiry)BIO 165 (From ecosystems to organisms)CHM 103 (General chemistry I)CHM 104 (General chemistry II)MTH 121 (Calculus I) OR MTH 119 (Intro. to statistics)ESC 113 (Environmental science I)ESC 114 (Environmental science II)ESC 201 (Environmental geology)ESC 310 (Environmental chemistry) OR ESC 312 (Toxicology)
In addition to the firm foundation gained from the core courses, students choose to explore specific areas of interest through 5 additional electives. Note that at least 3 must come from list B and at least 1 must come from list C; the 5th elective can come from either list B or list C.
B. SCIENCE ELECTIVES (choose at least 3)BIO 204 (Invertebrate zoology)BIO 242 (Entomology)BIO 255 (Ornithology) BIO 260 (Field botany and plant ecology)BIO 262 (Cultural and economic botany)BIO 265 (Behavior)BIO 268 (Freshwater ecology)BIO 270 (Ecology)BIO 272 (Marine biology)BIO 275-279 (Investigations in field biology) (only 1 can be taken for environmental science credit)BIO 460 (Behavioral ecology) BIO 465 (Conservation biology) CHM 201 (Organic chemistry I)CHM 202 (Organic chemistry II)CHM 311 (Analytical chemistry)ESC 310 (Environmental chemistry) [If not taken as part of A]ESC 312 (Toxicology) [If not taken as part of A]PHY 211 (General physics I)PHY 212 (General physics II)Other science courses as approved
C. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES ELECTIVES (choose at least 1)COM 336 OR COM 337 (Environmental communication)ECN 245 OR ECC 246 (Environmental economics)HST 341 (Environmental history of the U. S.)HST 373 (Environmental History of Latin America)PHL 246 (Environmental philosophy)PSC 216 OR PSC 217 (Environmental politics & policy making)PSC 330 OR PSC 331 (Comparative & international environmental policies)SUS 350 Env. & cultural conservation. in Costa Rica OR SUS 355 Climate change & sustainable development in Bangladesh
Other courses as approved






Minor Requirements
Students with interest in environmental science but who major in other fields (including, but not limited to, economics, history, political science, art, foreign language, biology, chemistry, and math) often wish to pursue a minor. A total of 7 courses, as described below, must be taken to earn a minor in environmental science.
A. CORE SCIENCES (5 courses)ESC 113 (Environmental science I) OR ESC 111 (Topics in Environmental science)ESC 114 (Environmental science II)ESC 201 (environmental geology ) OR ESC 101 (exploring the physical earth)BIO 160 (Foundations of biological inquiry) AND BIO 165 (From ecosystems to organisms) OR CHM 103 (General chemistry I) AND CHM 104 (General chemistry II) (whichever is most applicable for intended advanced courses in biology or chemistry,  below)
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ELECTIVE (1 course)NOTE: Some of these courses carry prerequisites (consult the catalog)
BIO 204 (Invertebrate zoology)BIO 242 (Entomology)BIO 255 (Ornithology) BIO 260 (Field botany and plant ecology)BIO 262 (Cultural and economic botany)BIO 265 (Behavior)BIO 268 (Freshwater ecology)BIO 270 (Ecology)BIO 272 (Marine biology)BIO 275-279 (Investigations in field biology) (only 1 can be taken for minor credit)BIO 460 (Behavioral ecology) BIO 465 (Conservation biology) CHM 201 (Organic chemistry I)CHM 202 (Organic chemistry II)CHM 311 (Analytical chemistry)COM 336 OR COM 337 (Environmental communication)ECN 245 OR ECC 246 (Environmental economics)HST 341 (Environmental history of the U. S.)HST 373 (Environmental History of Latin America)PHL 246 (Environmental philosophy)PHY 211 (General physics I)PHY 212 (General physics II)PSC 216 OR PSC 217 (Environmental politics & policy making)PSC 330 OR PSC 331 (Comparative & international environmental policies)SUS 350 Env. & cultural conservation. in Costa Rica ORSUS 355 Climate change & sustainable development in BangladeshOther courses as approved.
C. ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE ELECTIVE (1 course)NOTE: These courses carry prerequisites in biology or chemistry (consult the catalog)
ESC 301 (Environmental microbiology) ESC 310 (Environmental chemistry)ESC 312 (Toxicology)Other courses as approved.
Additional note: Students are strongly encouraged to take MTH 119 (Statistical analysis) or MTH (Calculus I) to satisfy the general academic requirement in reasoning.

Basketball Teams Fall in Scotty Wood Finals
 Saturday, November 17, 2012 - page 3







					 


Although a third consecutive Scotty Wood Tournament title may be absent from the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s basketball trophy cases, it wasn’t for lack of heart and competitiveness.

Both Muhlenberg teams came up short in comeback efforts in their respective championship games, the women falling to King’s, 73-69, and the men to Randolph, 70-58.



The women, who were up 40-37 at the half, cut an 11-point King’s lead down to five with 18 seconds remaining. The Mules applied a fullcourt press in the final minutes of the game, forcing two five-second calls, the second of which came following a left-wing jumper by senior Alita Zabrecky. 

Muhlenberg had a chance to cut the lead to two but was unable to connect on a three-pointer.

Zabrecky (left), who made the all-tournament team, led Muhlenberg with a double-double, scoring 23 points and grabbing 12 boards. Senior Kate Clawson and sophomore Leanna Tallamy added eight boards apiece, five on the offensive end for Tallamy, to help the Mules outrebound King’s, 55-43.

Junior Erin Laney, also an all-tournament team member, finished with eight points and seven boards. 

The Mules faced a zone defense throughout the game and attempted 35 threes. It worked to their advantage during the first half when they shot 38.1 percent from behind the arc, but they struggled to convert from long range after halftime, going just 1-for-14.

Kings came out quickly in the second half, regaining the lead just 29 seconds in and going on a 17-5 run.

The Mule defense only forced two turnovers in the first half and totaled just eight on the night, a stark contrast to the 25 that they forced in their first-round victory against Centenary.

On the men’s side, the Mules’ only lead came in the first minute of the game, as Randolph grabbed control early by making six of its first seven field-goal attempts.

Muhlenberg trailed by 34-29 at the start of second half, and Randolph extended its lead to 12 with 14:10 remaining.

However, Muhlenberg cut the margin to three with just under five minutes remaining and had three possessions with a chance to tie, but the WildCats held the Mules without a field goal for four minutes down the stretch.

Sophomore Malique Killing (right) led the offense with 18 points and was named to the all-tournament team. Junior Kevin Hargrove, Muhlenberg’s second all-tournament team member, grabbed eight rebounds and blocked three shots.

Sophomore AJ Dean was one of three Mules in double figures, with 11 points on the night. Freshman Alec Stavetski added 10.

Like Mule women, the men struggled from behind the arc in the second half, converting just two of their 13 attempts. The Mules grabbed 11 offensive boards, while limiting Randolph to just one.

Muhlenberg Advantage
Partner Program with Villanova Law



Muhlenberg's 3+3 partnership with the Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law provides qualified students with early access to one of the nation’s top law schools. They will spend the first three years at Muhlenberg earning a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and then enroll at Villanova Law to earn a Juris Doctor for the final three years, saving a year’s worth of time and tuition.

baseball wins first half of split twinbill
 





Cresta struck out eight and allowed only one run on four hits in his five innings of work, earning his 17th career win.



As if playing on the fields where the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers used to train wasn’t giving the Muhlenberg baseball team enough of a Major League experience, the Mules now have something else in common with the pros: a day-night doubleheader.

No, it wasn’t to maximize gate receipts. After heavy rains forced the cancellation of yesterday’s scheduled doubleheader 
against Northland, the field schedule had to be adjusted, and Muhlenberg’s twinbill against Daniel Webster was turned into a day-nighter.

Just like the big boys, the Mules used the long

ball to their advantage in the first game, belting their first two home runs of the season in a 13-9 win. Muhlenberg (4-3) hit another long one in
the nightcap but lost, 13-7.

Freshman Joseph Vila and junior Clint Lynch each went big fly for Muhlenberg as part of a 19-hit attack. Senior Eric Pomroy went 5-for-6, and senior Dan Fisher reached base in all six plate appearances, going 3-for-3 with two doubles, scoring three runs and driving in three.

Behind the offensive onslaught and the pitching of senior Phil Cresta, the Mules took a commanding 9-1 lead after 5½ innings. The Eagles, playing their first game of the season, made the final score close with home runs of their own, hitting three-run shots in the eighth and ninth.

Pomroy’s triple – the 13th of his career, moving him into a tie for third on the all-time list – drove in Fisher with the first run three batters into the game. The next batter, junior Joseph DiCecilia, singled in Pomroy to make it 2-0.

A two-out, two-run single by Pomroy in the second doubled Muhlenberg’s lead to 4-0. Pomroy later added two singles and an RBI double to complete his third career five-hit game.

Vila’s first career home run, a two-run blast, capped a three-run fourth, and Lynch led off the top of the seventh with his second career homer, one of his three hits in the game.

DiCecilia hit his second career home run in the seventh inning of Game 2.

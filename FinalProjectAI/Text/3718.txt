Two footballers honored by cc


 
Senior Michael Katz and sophomore Terrence Dandridge of the Muhlenberg football team were honored by the Centennial Conference for their performances in yesterdays 29-0 win at McDaniel.

Katz was named special teams player of the week after 

 

becoming the first kicker in program history to boot three 40-yard field goals in a game. He connected from 40, 46 and 44 yards to score the first nine points of the game. The 46-yarder was a career best.

A handful of Mules have made two 40-yarders in a game, the last being All-American Chris Reed against Gettysburg in 2002.

The three field goals tied a career high for Katz, who also made three last year against Dickinson. He now has 25 career field goals, just two short of tying the school record, and has made at least one from long range in each of his three varsity seasons.

Katz leads Muhlenberg with 37 points and is tied for second in the CC with his seven field goals.

This is the third straight week a Muhlenberg player has earned the weekly special teams honor from the CC, following back-to-back nods for kick returner Chase Nadell.

Dandridge was named offensive player of the week for the first time in his career. He rushed for a career-high 140 yards on 29 carries against a Green Terror defense that entered the game 22nd in Division III in rushing defense, allowing only 82.4 yards per game.

Dandridge scored the first two touchdowns of the game on runs of 3 and 16 yards. He gained 75 yards in the third quarter alone, helping the Mules maintain their lead and control the clock.

The 140 yards put Dandridge over 1,000 for his career, with 1,062. He is the 22nd Mule to rush for more than 1,000 yards.

Dandridge is second in the CC in rushing, at 92.8 yards per game, and his average of 5.7 yards per carry is the best for any CC back with at least 40 carries.

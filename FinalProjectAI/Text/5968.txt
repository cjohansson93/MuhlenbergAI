Women’s Tennis Freshman Wins at ITAs; Women’s Soccer Falls


Freshman Jennifer Goldberg of the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team won the Blue 3 singles draw at the ITA Southeast Regional, hosted by Mary Washington.

Goldberg won three of her four matches convincingly, including a 6-1, 6-0 triumph against a Stevenson player in the final. In the semis, she needed a 10-8 third-set supertiebreaker to knock off a player from Franklin & Marshall.

Goldberg and partner Ashlee Ludwig reached the semifinals of the Blue 3 doubles draw before losing 9-7 to a Mary Washington duo that went on to win the final.

Freshman Sharen Resnikoff went 2-1 to advance to the semifinals in Blue 1 singles, including a 6-0, 6-1 win against a Swarthmore player.

Playing in the championship doubles draw, the No. 1 doubles team of sophomores Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman defeated a Haverford twosome in the first round.

Women’s Soccer


For the second straight day, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team fell behind early and could not catch up.

Stevenson headed in a corner kick 2:41 into the game and went on to win, 2-1. Trailing 2-0, the Mules (4-4-1) cut the deficit in half 18 seconds before halftime when sophomore Stephanie 
Tramutola put in a free kick from 25 yards out for her first goal of the season. The second half was scoreless.

Despite a less-than-promising forecast, the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team stayed dry and got in a full weekend of competition, its first of the 2011-12 year.

The Mules played a dual match at Arcadia on Saturday, winning 8-1, and 


hosted the three-team Mule Fall Classic on Sunday.

The No. 1 doubles team of senior Jordan Rutt and sophomore Jason Teitelbaum (right) went 3-0 on the weekend, with impressive scores of 8-1, 8-3 and 8-1.

Several Mule freshmen made strong debuts. Daniel Lakhman posted a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 3 vs. Arcadia in his first career singles match, then defeated Wilkes’ No. 1 player at the Mule Fall Classic before pulling out due to injury.

Lakhman’s classmate and No. 2 doubles partner, Eric Chavis, also won his first two singles matches before retiring in his third. As a doubles team, Lakhman and Chavis won vs. Arcadia and lost two close 8-6 matches to No. 1 doubles teams at the Mule Fall Classic.

A third freshman, Corey Galembo, went 2-0 in the sixth singles flight at the Mule Fall Classic.

Teitelbaum, who blanked his Arcadia opponent, 6-0, 6-0, had a team-best 5-1 record for the weekend.

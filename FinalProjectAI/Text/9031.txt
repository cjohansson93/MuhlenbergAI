AFTERMATH:THINKING AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH
Occasional Papers of the Center for Ethics and Leadership
Muhlenberg CollegeVolume 1, Number 1Spring 2002
FIFTEEN MUHLENBERG PROFESSORS TAKE ON THE ATTACKS, THE WAR, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.
In the immediate wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, the Center for Ethics at Muhlenberg College invited its faculty to contribute essays on the subject to a unique volume entitled, Aftermath: Thinking After September 11th. These essays, written by faculty from across the curriculum, are at times reflective, critical, analytical, and passionate, but always thoughtful and accessible to a general audience.The inaugural issue of the Center for Ethics’ Occasional Papers, Aftermath is written in a style that is devoid of cumbersome scholarly notation and alienating academic language. Through this collection of reflections, thoughts, analyses, opinions, and questions, it is hoped that the reader will join the Muhlenberg Community in sorting out what last September, and its aftermath, means.
Featured on the cover of this beautifully softbound volume is a Joseph Elliott black-and-white photograph of the stunningly beautiful September 11th memorial that was erected in the College’s Center for the Arts in the Fall of 2001.

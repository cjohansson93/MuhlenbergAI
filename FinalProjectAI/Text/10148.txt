Ciarla Ordering & Costs (2021-2022)

Every senior who provides a senior portrait for the 2022 Ciarla Yearbook will receive one complimentary copy of the yearbook! 

Seniors do not need to order a yearbook if they have provided a portrait. The 2022 Ciarla will be distributed this fall and mailed directly to the graduate at the home address on file in the Registrar's office by the June 1 deadline.

Seniors may purchase a digital eYearbook to accompany the print book for $10. Learn more about Yearbook Orders & Delivery here.






Students and families can order copies of the yearbook at any time during the academic year by visiting the Balfour Online Store.

2022 Ciarla: $62 (including shipping and tax.) 
E-Yearbook: $10 to purchase an electronic yearbook as well. (The e-yearbook is not sold separately.)
The deadline to order the Ciarla yearbook is June 1, 2022. Any orders placed after the June 1 deadline cannot be guaranteed due to printing deadlines and the excessive cost of ordering extra books.
Yearbooks will be distributed in the fall and mailed to the home address provided with the order.



Don't forget to support your favorite graduate during this unique year with a Senior Pride Ad!
If you have a question about ordering, payment or delivery, please visit the Ciarla FAQ page or contact the Ciarla at ciarla@muhlenberg.edu.

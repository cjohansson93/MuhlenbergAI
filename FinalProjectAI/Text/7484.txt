Baseball Walks Off with Extra-Inning Win
 Thursday, March 6, 2014







					 




In a game with a minimum of scoring opportunities, the Muhlenberg baseball team “Max”-imized its last chance.

A pinch-hit single by senior Max Litvak in the bottom of the 10th brought home the winning run as the Mules evened their record at 4-4 with a 2-1 comeback win against York.



The game, played in cold, windy and – from the sixth inning on – rainy weather, was scoreless through eight innings. No team even had two runners on in the same inning until the Mules loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh.

Keeping the Spartans, who came in with a .340 team batting average and scored 43 runs in their first three games in Myrtle Beach, in check was junior David Anderson. The righty threw eight brilliant innings, allowing only two hits and four baserunners. Anderson (left) struck out five, one with a runner on third and two outs in the fifth, and walked only one in the best outing of his career.

Muhlenberg’s starting pitchers have allowed only one earned run in their last 22 1/3 innings, and the entire staff has not allowed an earned run in 20 innings.

York (3-2) finally broke the scoreless deadlock in the top of the ninth on a walk, wild pitch and throwing error on a bunt. Junior Seth Fenster then came in and stemmed the tide, retiring all six batters he faced to earn his first career win.

In the bottom of the ninth, junior Jimmy Cody led off with a walk and went to second on a sacrifice. A single by senior John Scuderi sent Cody to third, and he came in with the tying run on a ground ball down the third-base line by junior Nick Plinio.
 
The winning rally started with two outs and nobody on when junior Kurt Johnson singled. On the second pitch to Litvak, Johnson stole second base easily. On the next pitch, Litvak drilled a ball over the first-base bag and down the line. Johnson came around with the winning run, then went to join the pile of celebrating Mules at first base.

The walkoff hit by Litvak was the first by a Mule in extra innings since 2008.

Football season ends at Wesley





Vaughn caught five balls for 97 yards and a score.



Wesley came into its NCAA Tournament first-round football game against Muhlenberg leading Division III in total defense. And the Wolverines showed
their offense isn't too shabby either.

Wesley rolled up 649 yards of total offense and scored touchdowns on eight of its 11 possessions to knock off the Mules, 53-14. Wesley advances to the second round to face Montclair State.

The Mules, for their part, had 270 yards of offense, 82 more than the Wolverines were allowing. They scored both of their touchdowns after junior 
Chase Nadell blocked a Wesley punt late in the fourth quarter.

Two plays after Nadells block, Dan Deighan connected with Isaiah Vaughn for a 45-yard scoring strike to put the Mules on the board.

On the ensuing kickoff, senior Corry Whitehead, making the first start of his career, delivered an onside kick that Muhlenberg recovered at its own 42-yard line.

Thats when the Mule offense had its most success of the day. Deighan picked up 38 yards spread over two runs as Muhlenberg drove to the Wolverine doorstep. On the sixth 




Deighan finished with 242 total yards (172 passing, 70 rushing) and one touchdown through the air.



play of the drive, Terrence Dandridge scored from 3 yards out with 1:51 to play to cap the 58-yard scoring march.

Centennial Conference defensive player of the year Patrick McDonough led the Mule defense with nine tackles to give him 105 stops on the season. Matt Musick also added two tackles for loss for Muhlenberg. 

It marks the fifth straight year that Wesley (10-0) has eliminated the Centennial Conference champion from the NCAA Tournament. And it is the third time that that champion has been Muhlenberg.


But the loss cannot put a damper on the turnaround that occurred in Allentown this fall. The Mules rebounded from last years 3-7 record to finish 7-4. They also returned to the top of the CC by claiming a share of their record-tying ninth title.

The graduating seniors will leave Muhlenberg with three CC titles in four seasons, the second-most by one class in school history. And with a strong nucleus of returning skill players, the Mules have a solid foundation on which to build for the future.

deluca, fletcher named to all-ccfirst team


Seniors John DeLuca and Nick Fletcher of the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team were selected to the All-Centennial Conference first team.

The first player in program history to earn first-team honors from the 


CC twice, DeLuca (left) again was recognized as one of the top low defenders in one of the top 
men’s lacrosse 


leagues in Division III. He led the Mules with 19 caused turnovers, tied for the team lead with 34 ground balls and contributed to the offense with two goals and two assists.

DeLuca finished his career with 94 ground balls and 12 goals.

DeLuca, the 2008 CC offensive player of the year in football, is the first Muhlenberg athlete to be voted to the All-CC first team twice in two different sports since
Joshua Carter in football and baseball during the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years.

Fletcher (right) earned CC honors for the first time after scoring a team-leading 13 goals in league games. Overall, he tied for the team lead
with 15 goals and added three assists, including one on the game-winning goal in overtime in the Mules’ season-ending defeat of Ursinus.

The midfielder ended his career 10th on the program’s all-time list in points (57) and tied for eighth in assists (19).

This is the second straight year Muhlenberg has placed two players on the All-CC first team. The Mules did not have a first-team selection prior to last season.

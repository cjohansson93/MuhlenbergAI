There is no education major at Muhlenberg College.  Instead, we offer an education program for students interested in becoming a preK-12 teacher.  Students interested in the education program choose a major that connects with their teaching interests.  
The Pennsylvania Department of Education requires that students seeking preK - 12 education certificate engage in an intensive course of study that requires a specific sequence of courses and field work.  If your advisee is interested in our education program, please have them contact our Education Department as soon as possible.  A faculty member in this department will serve as their second advisor.
For more information and suggestions about courses go to Recommended Courses by Departments & Programs on the right menu.

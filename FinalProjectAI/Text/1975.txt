A Welcome from President Harring
Muhlenberg College brings scholars and students together to explore complex ideas, increase our understanding of an always-changing world and think beyond traditional boundariesâand has for more than 170 years. At our core, Muhlenberg is driven by a unique community that fosters a collaborative environment where students, faculty and staff live, learn and work together toward achieving individual success.
Muhlenberg is a leader in integrating a rigorous academic program with meaningful experiences in research, internships and global study. The Muhlenberg experience centers on relationships with exceptional faculty and opportunities for personal growth and leadership outside of the classroom. The Collegeâs inclusive, diverse campus, commitment to community engagement, thriving arts scene and focus on student success enrich the student experience.
At Muhlenberg, education is about preparing students for whatâs nextâand not just graduate school or a first job, but to be vital members of their communities. I am honored to lead the College as its reputation for academic excellence and powerful outcomes grows, demonstrating the enduring value of a Muhlenberg liberal arts education.
Kathleen E. Harring, Ph.D.President

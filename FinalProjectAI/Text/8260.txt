'Berg Hosts Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit



Traveling display promotes inclusion of people with disabilities


	 Friday, April 17, 2015  04:37 PM

Muhlenberg College will host Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit, an interactive display, in the Seegers Union Great Room on Monday, April 20 and Tuesday, April 21, from 10 a.m. - 6 p.m. Sponsored by the Dean of Academic Life and the Office of Disability Services, the display appears in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act being signed into law.  The exhibit is free and open to the public.
Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit is designed to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities through respect for others, comfort during interactions and awareness of disability issues.
The exhibit was created by Saint Louis University graduate students. Evolving from a class project into a sophisticated exhibit, Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit debuted at SLU on October 27, 2010.  Since then, The Ability Exhibit has been displayed at other colleges and universities, and it received national recognition at the 2011 ACPA College Student Educators International annual convention.  
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year college located in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.  Muhlenberg offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, along with selected pre-professional studies and a number of interdisciplinary majors.

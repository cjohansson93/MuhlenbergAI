Women's Basketball Falls to F&M at Home
 Saturday, February 4, 2012 -page 2







					 




In a matchup for sole possession of second place in the Centennial Conference, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team fell to Franklin & Marshall, 59-54.

The Mules (15-5, 10-5) are now tied for third place in the conference with Ursinus with two weeks remaining in the regular season.

In the loss, senior Alexandra Chili hit six 3-pointers to become the CC career leader for men or women with 308 in her career.

Muhlenberg started out hot, getting 10 quick points from Chili and holding the Diplomats without a field goal for the first 7:06 to open up a 14-2 lead.

But F&M scored 10 straight points to pull within a bucket, and the game stayed close for the rest of the way.

F&M (15-6, 12-4) took its first lead on the first bucket of the second half.
Muhlenberg took its final lead on a layup by junior Kate Clawson at the 4:07 mark and tied it one last time at 49 on a jumper by senior Katy Rossino with 2:08 to play. 

The Diplomats scored five straight before Chili hit a layup to make it a one-possession game.

The Mules stole an inbounds pass under the basket down three with 32.3 seconds left, but they turned the ball back over, and the Diplomats hit a pair of free throws to stretch the lead to five.

Chili gave Muhlenberg hope by burying a deep three from the left wing to make it a two-point game with 17.7 seconds left, but F&M hit three of four foul shots to ice the game.

Chili (right) and junior Alita Zabrecky combined to score the Mules’ first 23 points. Chili finished with a game-high 28 points, while Zabrecky added nine and a team-high 10 rebounds. Rossino set a career high with six points.

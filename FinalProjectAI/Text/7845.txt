Men's Basketball Falls to Swarthmore
 Tuesday, December 2, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team completed a long uphill climb, only to slip at the very end and lose a Centennial
Conference home game to Swarthmore, 70-66.


The Garnet (3-3, 2-1) shot 63.2 percent from the field in the first half, taking the lead eight minutes in and going into the
break with a seven-point lead. The bulge swelled to 10 early in the second half before the Mules (4-3, 0-2) began their comeback.

Although Muhlenberg cut the lead to one with 12:43 left, it did not draw even or take the lead until senior Malique Killing
hit a three-pointer with 1:01 left to make it 66-65. Swarthmore drove in for a go-ahead layup on the next possession, however,
and iced the game with three free throws in the final 16.5 seconds.

Killing (right) was 5-for-7 from three-point range and led all scorers with 28 points, moving into third place on
the Mules’ all-time list with 1,657 career points. Freshman Nick Rindock (left) scored a 
career-high 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting.

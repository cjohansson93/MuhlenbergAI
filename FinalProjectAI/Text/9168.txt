Recycling & Waste Disposal at Muhlenberg College
As part of our commitment to minimizing our environmental footprint, we have expanded our recycling program and are sending our trash to a waste-to-energy facility. Waste-to âenergy plants produce less CO2 per ton of garbage than a landfill and are designated as renewable energy generators by the USEPA. Our main campus is thus now landfill-free.
On campus, all recycling goes into one bin. Sustainable Waste Solutionsâ (SWS) recycling plant will mechanically sort the single-stream recyclables into separate paper, plastic (1-7), metal and glass groups. To determine if a piece of plastic is recyclable, look for the number in the triangle and follow the guidelines to the left.You will see new dumpsters and receptacles as part of our new program.  Blue = Recycling Green = Trash

Itâs Recyclable If:

It tears, and its paper (used to be the wax coating would prevent milk cartons and food boats from being recycled - now the process can separate out the wax)
Itâs a #1-7 plastic EXCEPT Styrofoam & PVC (not in food products)
Itâs an aluminum or metal foil, food or beverage can
Itâs a glass food & beverage container
Itâs mostly clean, empty and loose

Itâs Trash if:

Itâs a plastic bag or other thin plastic material similar to a bag (ex. chip bags, soy sauce packets, most plastic food wrapping). They are too thin and will tangle in the machinery
Itâs very thin paper material (paper towels, napkins, toilet paper). They are also too thin and will tangle in the machinery
Itâs a "mixed" item with more than one recyclable element (ex. Pringles cans have foil, paper and plastic, soy milk boxes as well)

Women's Cross Country Crosses Regions to Run in Connecticut
 Saturday, October 13, 2012 - page 2







					 





The Muhlenberg women’s cross country team didn’t travel cross country, but it did ride across a few states to test itself against strong teams from other regions.

In spite of having team members battling illness and injury, the Mules represented themselves very well at the Connecticut College Invitational, finishing sixth out of 20 teams in their final meet before the Centennial Conference Championships. 

The men (and a few of the women) stayed closer to home and came in 10th out of 13 teams (mostly from Division I) at Lafayette’s Leopard Invitational.

Finishing ahead of the women at Connecticut were Tufts (ranked fourth in New England), Plattsburgh State (ranked sixth in the Atlantic Region), Keene State, Oneonta State (ranked 10th in the Atlantic Region) and Division II Southern Connecticut State. The Mules, who were just 16 points from third place, came into the meet ranked seventh in the Mideast Region and finished ahead of Marywood, the team ranked eighth.

Senior Samantha Mayden, her arm in a cast, came in second – her second-straight finish in the runner-up spot and her fourth top-three finish in as many races this season. 

Junior Nicki Cronin, in her first full race since returning from an injury that delayed the start of her season, came in 23rd. Senior Erica Bash was 31st in the field of 244.

The other two runners in Muhlenberg’s top five, freshman Melanie Tramontina (left) and junior Jackie Shulack, also crossed the finish line in under 24 minutes.

The men finished behind seven Division I teams at Lafayette, tying another Division I squad – St. Francis (Pa.) – for 10th place. 

Junior Bobby McGetrick (right) was the top Mule finisher, coming in 48th overall and ninth among Division III runners. Sophomore Luke Munyan was the next Division III runner, finishing in 51st place overall.

The top five for the men did an outstanding job of pack running; they were separated by only 43 seconds.

Carnevale Qualifies for Hurdles Final at NCAA Championships

Carnevale (third from the bottom, in the red speed suit) needs to beat two runners in the final to tie the best finish ever (sixth place) by a Muhlenberg female at the NCAA indoor meet.




Stephanie Carnevale is running so fast these days, there’s not even time to spell her entire name.

Carnevale’s name was shortened to “Stephanie Carnev” on the display board at the Division III Indoor Track & Field Championships at North Central College. But wasn’t how her name appeared, it was where her name appeared that was most important.

The Muhlenberg junior finished fourth in the second heat of the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.85. It was the seventh-fastest time of the 15 runners in the event, and it qualified her for tomorrow’s final.

If Carnevale finishes the race tomorrow, she will be an All-American.

Carnevale’s time broke the Centennial Conference mark of 8.95 that was set last year, and it also broke the school record of 8.97, which she set at last weekend’s ECAC Championships. She has lowered her time by incredible chunks for such a short race: Exactly one month ago, Carnevale established the school record at 9.10, and she has chopped a quarter-second off that time in just four meets.

The Mules’s other national qualifier, the distance-medley relay team of junior Nicki Cronin, sophomore Kirsten Kuchera and seniors Erica Bash and Samantha Mayden, finished 10th.

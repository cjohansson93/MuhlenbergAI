Wrestling Drops Last CC Dual



Despite winning four of six contested bouts, the Muhlenberg wrestling team dropped its final Centennial Conference dual match of the season, 33-21 
to McDaniel in a rescheduled match at Ursinus.

Back-to-back pins by junior Kevin Homan at 149 and senior Keith Swanson at 157 cut McDaniel's 15-0 lead to 15-12,
and then junior Patrick Gibson tied the match with a 7-3 decision.

The Green Terror won three of the final four weight classes, two by forfeit, to capture the match. Senior Bill Sholly won by disqualification at 184.

Homan finished the season 4-2 in CC duals, while Swanson was 3-2.

Sophomore Matt O'Hara dives for a loose ball in the second half. He had a team-high 3 assists without a turnover in 36 minutes.



The Muhlenberg men's basketball team could not recover from a rough first half and lost at McDaniel, 68-54, in its last scheduled road game of the season.

The loss dropped the Mules (12-11, 8-8) into a three-way 



tie for fifth place in the Centennial Conference. The two teams the Mules are tied with - Haverford and Ursinus - are their opponents in the final two games of the regular season. If Muhlenberg wins both games, it will qualify for the CC playoffs.

McDaniel (12-11, 9-7) held Muhlenberg without a field goal for almost the final 11 minutes of the first half, opening up a 33-17 lead at the break. The Mules could get no closer than nine points in the second half.

Freshman Kevin Hargrove shot 7-of-10 from the field and finished with 16 points. Junior Spencer Liddic notched his 13th double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds, and junior Justin Greenstone added a season-high 10 points.

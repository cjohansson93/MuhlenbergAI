Welcome to the Office of Multicultural Life (OML). OML is committed to advancing Muhlenberg Collegeâs mission to create a welcoming and inclusive campus.
The Office of Multicultural Life advocates on behalf of historically marginalized populations. The Office is located in the Multicultural Center and is home to multicultural and social justice oriented student affinity groups.
OML offers a number of programs including educational workshops on social identity, cross cultural conversations and heritage month celebrations.


Muhlenberg alumni Anvi Gadani â12, Chris Chin â19 and Dermerkersal Karbah â20 joined Robin Riley-Casey, associate dean of students and diversity initiatives, to discuss the ways in which the Office of Multicultural Life and the Multicultural Center deepened their college experience. 
The January 2022 panel, held virtually during the College's annual Mulementum event, included reflection on how the skills and lessons learned through OML have continued to be a part of these graduates' professional lives far beyond Muhlenberg.

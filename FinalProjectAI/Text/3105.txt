boyle named to academic team



For the third straight year, senior Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was named to the 
ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division team, as chosen by the College Sports Information Directors of America. Boyle
was a third-team selection in 2007 and 2009 and a second-team pick last year.

A mathematics major and dean’s list student, Boyle has won the Miriam E. Koehler Award for Excellence in Mathematics, the Carol Emhardt Kuntzleman Memorial Award
(for excellence and a high level of participation) and the Sidney Weikert Award as sophomore athlete of the year during her time at Muhlenberg.

On the court, Boyle is one of the top players in Muhlenberg women’s basketball history. She ranks third all-time in scoring (1,379 points) and field goals (554) 
and fifth in assists (257). A two-time first-team All-Centennial Conference selection, she needs 21 points to become only the fourth player in CC history with 1,400 points and 250 assists. 
Boyle earned All-America honorable mention from the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association last year and has been named CC player of the week five times in her
career.

This season, Boyle is second on the 20th-ranked Mules in scoring, averaging 14.0 points per game. She also is second in blocked shots (11), tied for second in steals (27), third in
assists (60) and tied for third in three-pointers (11). Her shooting percentages from the field (.436) and the line (.825) are the best of her career, and she ranks in the
top five in the CC in assist-to-turnover ratio.

Boyle also is part of the winningest senior class in program history, with an exceptional four-year record of 84-20 (.808). Muhlenberg won the CC championship her freshman
and junior seasons and has clinched the regular-season title this year.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a 
starter or significant reserve on her team.

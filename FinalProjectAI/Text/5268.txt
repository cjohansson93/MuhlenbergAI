Softball, Men’s Lacrosse Lose to Ranked Foes

Softball


Muhlenberg lost a pair of one-run games, 4-3 to Methodist and 2-1 to Neumann.

Against Methodist, ranked 19th in the Division III preseason poll, sophomore Ashley Brewer took a two-hit shutout and a 3-0 lead into the sixth. The Monarchs scored three in the sixth (two unearned) to tie the game, then plated the winning run in the eighth.

Brewer struck out a career-high nine batters. Sophomore Jess Kasza had two of the Mules’ four hits.

Sophomore Alyssa Bruckner allowed only five hits in the second game, but single runs in the third and fourth were enough for the Knights to win.

After the Muhlenberg baseball team scored 44 runs, but allowed 36, in its first four games, it was time for the pitchers to shine.

Behind excellent starts by seniors Brent Morris and Mike Misciagna, the Mules split a doubleheader with Husson.

In the opening game, Morris pitched a complete-game six-hitter to earn his second career win. Muhlenberg scored four runs in the top of the first, which would prove to be enough for Morris in his fifth career start.

Misciagna (right) did even better in his first career start. He took a shutout into the top of seventh and was two outs from a win before Husson scored four runs against the bullpen.

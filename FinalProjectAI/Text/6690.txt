Stavetski, Men's Basketball Get Back on Track at Swarthmore
 Wednesday, January 30, 2013







					 

 Women’s basketball



Maybe it was the spring-like weather on the second-to-last day of January that gave Alec Stavetski a little more spring in his step.

Or maybe it was the encouragement of his teammates and better work habits. Whatever the case, the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team is happy to have Stavetski back to his former self for the stretch run.

Stavetski shook off a stretch of rough games to score 16 points, including 10 in the first half, as the Mules bounced back from Saturday’s loss to Johns Hopkins with a 70-52 win at Swarthmore.



Curry was 4-for-6 from three-point range to move past 150 career three-pointers made. He is shooting a CC-best .451 from behind the arc this season.



Hot-shooting junior Austin Curry added 17 points, and junior Kevin Hargrove (11) and sophomore Malique Killing (10) also scored in double figures for Muhlenberg (12-8, 8-5), which remained two games out of first place in the Centennial Conference.

Stavetski was the Mules’s second-leading scorer, averaging 13.0 points per game, through the first weekend of January. But in the next seven games, he scored only 32 points, and his average went below double digits for the first time since early in the year.




Junior James Albano scored six points in the first half, four on back-to-back layups in the 13-0 run.



“I definitely hit that freshman wall in January,” he said. “I’ve been working on taking care of my body a lot better, spending more time in the weight room. I’ve also been working on my skills on my own and trying to improve my endurance.

“Matt [O’Hara] and Malique have been telling me to keep shooting, because they know what I can do,” he added.

Stavetski showed what he could do soon after entering the Swarthmore game, nailing a three-pointer on his first shot to extend Muhlenberg’s lead to 12-5 six minutes in.

“When that first one went in, it was like a little weight off my shoulder,” he said.

Stavetski later fed Hargrove for a layup and hit a pullup jumper as the Mules ran their lead to 20-10. The Garnet (5-15, 4-9) got to within four points at 25-21, but a 13-0 run capped by Stavetski’s three-point play gave Muhlenberg a 17-point lead late in the half.

The margin was between 13 and 22 for the entire second half, and Muhlenberg breezed to its 10th straight win against Swarthmore.

The Mules held the Garnet to 38.2-percent shooting and forced 20 turnovers. O’Hara recorded a career-high six steals.

“This was a big bounce-back game for us,” said Stavetski. “We want to feel good about ourselves going into the F&M game. We played great defense tonight and that’s what we’ll need to do Saturday.”

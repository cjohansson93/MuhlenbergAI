Welcome to Muhlenberg! Youâve joined a wonderful place. Incredible learning experiences, intellectual discoveries, new friendships, and great memories of a lifetime await you. Itâs wonderful to have you as part of this smart and caring community.
While college isnât new to you, you may still be experiencing deep and mixed emotions: eagerness to get underway, anticipation about diving into challenging courses and meeting new people, and apprehension about the many unknowns. What will our roommates be like? How will we make a whole new set of friends? What are the professors here really like? Where do we go for help (which we all need every now and then)?
Youâll find that each question will lead to choices that shape your life at Muhlenbergâto friends who will nourish and support you, to courses that will open doors to new ideas and interests, to leadership activities you didnât know that youâd love so much and to the extensive support that our campus community provides for your mental, physical and spiritual life.
This website will help prepare you for your arrival on campus. The menu bar connects you to important information about moving in, Welcome Weekend and Transfer Orientation, Spring Orientation, and much more. Use this information to get off to a great start at Muhlenberg. And let us know if we can help. We look forward to seeing you soon!

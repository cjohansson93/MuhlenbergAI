The âNew Voices / New Visionsâ theater festival returns this fall to Muhlenberg College â an evening of new and innovative short plays showcasing the talents of up-and-coming playwrights and directors, in a venue that encourages artistic risk-taking and experimentation. The festival runs in the Studio Theatre in Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance, Nov. 28 â Dec. 2.
The plays in this yearâs festival are all written and directed by women, most of whom are current Muhlenberg students or alumni. Jenna Adamek â19 directs âStill Growing Upâ by Camille Seidel â18; Anna Ricciuti â19 directs âThe Repair Man,â by Sarah Jae Leiber â19; and Abigail Martz â19 directs âAm I Blue,â by Beth Henley (âCrimes of the Heartâ).
âThis festival is a great showcase for women,â Ricciuti says, âwhich is not something we often see in the greater theater world.â
âI think the plays will come across beautifully, separately and in tandem, when theyâre presented as a full piece,â Martz says.
 

 
In âStill Growing Up,â long-time best friends talk about life, love and difference as they drive from high school to an abortion clinic.
âI wrote this play as sort of a character study,â Seidel says. âIâm really fascinated with how complicated and intimate female friendships areâespecially in adolescent years.
âOur teen years are like a test run,â she says. âWe act ways we donât like and say things we donât mean to see what works for us and scope out what feels right. I wrote this play because I donât think thereâs enough theatre that takes young girls seriously and honors their feelings and emotions.â
Adamek responded to the complexity and fullness of the characters in the play.
âI hope the play will start conversations about how to better support your friends, and how to react when theyâre struggling,â she says. âItâs a play about what it means to be a friend.â
Seidel is new to playwritingâshe discovered that particular voice during her senior year playwriting workshop, where she wrote and rewrote âStill Growing Upâ until she was satisfied. She was known at Muhlenberg for acting and improv comedy, but has always written, primarily poetry and sketch comedy. She also recently co-wrote a childrenâs theatre piece.
Adamek started directing in high school and since has worked for several professional theatre companies, as well as directing such pieces as âDoes this Woman Have a Name?â last fall in the Studio Theatre.
âJenna is one of the most thoughtful and confident young directors I have had the pleasure to work with,â says Matt Moore, faculty advisor and artistic director of âNew Voices / New Visions.â âShe will absolutely do justice to this intimate drama.â
 

âThe Repair Manâ centers around a young, depressed, Jewish woman named Nick who is visited by a dishwasher repairman who wants to fix more than just her dishwasher.
âIt sounds like a porno, but itâs not,â Ricciuti says with a laugh.
Ricciuti and Leiber are both interested in confronting stigma about mental illness.
âIâm hoping that this play will give people who might be struggling with mental health issues an opportunity to see themselves represented in Nick,â Ricciuti says. âIâm hoping that it will start conversations about destigmatizing mental illness and building a community around people who are struggling.â
âMedia depictions of mental illness have always disturbed me,â Leiber says. âDepression is not beautiful or poetic, and it is not necessarily earth-shatteringly noticeable. The truth about a lot of depression is that itâs banal. People live with depression for years without knowing it because depression is not a clean list of symptoms and cures. Itâs different for everybody.â
Leiber has written several plays that have featured Off-Broadway (âGrand Theft Tea Leavesâ) and on the Muhlenberg stage, as well as dramaturgy and editorial features for numerous theater productions. She also writes for the BroadwayWorld website.
Ricciuti previously helmed Jane Andersonâs âTough Choices for the New Centuryâ in the Studio Theatre, and served as assistant director for the fall 2016 âNew Visionsâ production of âIcarusâs Mother.â She also assistant directed a site-specific production of âA Midsummer Nightâs Dreamâ for the Shipwreck Theatre Co., in the summer of 2017.
âAnna is intuitive and funny, compassionate and open-hearted,â Moore says. âSheâs led her cast to a deeply nuanced treatment of this material.â

Beth Henleyâs âAm I Blueâ is the story of John Polk and Ashbe, who meet in New Orleans in 1968 against all odds.
âJohn Polk comes from a middle class background while Ashbe comes from a very lower class neighborhood,â Martz says. âThey end up finding out all these similarities between each other and realize they both view themselves as outcasts.â
Martz was drawn to the playâs vibrant female lead and meditations on friendship and intimacy.
"Human connection is really important to me; I like exploring those relationships that often get grazed over,â she says. âThis play is really a communion of souls.â
Martz previously directed âTuesdayâ as a Studio Production last spring, and served as assistant director on the 2016 âNew Visionsâ world-premiere production âTerrible Beautiful Bodies.â
"Abby brings her fiery intellect and keen theatrical sensibility to this early work of Beth Henley's, which will draw the audience into an intimate and subtly life-altering experience,â Moore says.

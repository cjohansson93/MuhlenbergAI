One of the highlights of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship program is that our students have the opportunity to learn from experienced, practicing entrepreneurs. All of our dedicated entrepreneurship faculty have founded their own ventures and worked for multiple startups. Our faculty brings not just breadth and depth of academic knowledge, but the lessons learned by doing.

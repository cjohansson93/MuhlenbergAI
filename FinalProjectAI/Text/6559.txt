Volleyball
 
The Muhlenberg volleyball team suffered its third Centennial Conference loss in a row, dropping a heartbreaker at Dickinson in five sets.

The Mules (8-6, 1-3) battled back twice to tie the match by winning the second and fourth sets, but the Red Devils took the deciding fifth set, 15-11.
 
Sophomores Holly Hynson and Lindsey Gambocurta led Muhlenberg with 12 and 11 kills, respectively. Sophomore Nikki Dickson had a career-high 40 assists.

Men’s Soccer
 
The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team lost for the second time in three days, this time 1-0 at Haverford. The Fords (6-4, 3-1) scored the lone goal in the 30th minute and held on to defeat the Mules (5-3, 2-2) for the first time since 2001.

The Susquehanna defense allowed only 217 yards and forced five turnovers in handing the Muhlenberg football team one of its worst offensive days in a long time. 

The shutout loss was the first for the Mules (3-2, 2-2) in a regular-season game since 1998 – a streak of 142 consecutive games. Muhlenberg had not been kept off the scoreboard in a Centennial Conference 
game since 1996. 


The Mules drove into Crusader territory on two of their first three possessions but turned over the ball both times, once on a fumble and once on an interception. 
Susquehanna (2-3, 1-3), which got a 31-yard field goal on its third drive, scored the first touchdown of the game on a 70-play drive following the interception. 

The second Crusader TD came on a short field after a fumbled punt return in the third quarter.

Muhlenberg missed a field goal early in the third quarter and was stopped on downs in the fourth on its only other two drives inside the Susquehanna 40. 

The Mule defense allowed only 250 total yards. Sophomore Ian Gimbar (right) had four tackles for loss, including two sacks, and junior Peter Sorrento and 
senior Matt Johnson notched three tackles for loss apiece. 

Senior Shane O’Connor was responsible for the lone Crusader turnover, picking off a pass attempt on a fake punt.

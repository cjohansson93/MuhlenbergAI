Women's Basketball Heads into Holiday Break with Win

The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team had a little “Pep” in its step from the start of
its first Centennial conference home game of the season.

Senior Nicole Pepe scored nine of the Mules’ first 13 points and finished with a 
career-high-tying 19 as the Mules rolled past Washington, 82-51.

Senior Leanna Tallamy recorded her fourth straight double-double (18 points, 10 rebounds)
as part of a balanced attack in which 12 different players scored and 12 notched assists.

Pepe, who was held scoreless in Saturday’s loss to DeSales, tied a school record by shooting 4-for-4
from three-point range. Her second three-pointer, six minutes into the game, gave the Mules (4-5, 3-2) the
lead for good at 13-11 and was part of a 17-1 run that put Muhlenberg ahead by 13 points. The
Shorewomen (3-6, 0-4) never got closer than seven points the rest of the game.

Muhlenberg led by as many as 34 points in the second half and went on to defeat Washington for the 
35th time in the last 36 meetings.

The Mules, who came in averaging almost 22 offensive rebounds per game (ninth in Division III),
grabbed only nine – mainly because they didn’t miss many shots. They shot 49.2 percent from
the field and were 10-of-22 from three-point range.

Sophomore Michelle Poole (right) made a pair of three-pointers and finished with eight points. 
Senior Emily Lesher contributed four points, three rebounds, five assists and a blocked shot.

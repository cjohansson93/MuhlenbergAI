 The diverse production program of the Department offers design and technical theatre majors the production opportunities and the tools they need to practice their craft. The Department offers extensive laboratory experience in costume, lighting, scenic, and sound design and technology, under the guidance of skilled, experienced professionals.
Mainstage theatre and dance productions feature student-designed costumes, lights, and set several times each season. Non-design majors also have plenty of opportunity to participate in the production process, as carpenters, electricians, stitchers, and crew â and all theatre and dance majors are introduced to stagecraft and encouraged to take on technical and production challenges as well as performance roles during their years at Muhlenberg.

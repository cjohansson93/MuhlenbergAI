Now that Kate McLaughlin Santore â06 and her husband live in Atlanta, they have plenty of friends who attended schools that are part of the Southeastern Conference (SEC)âpublic universities like the University of Georgia with tens of thousands of students and a social scene that centers around football fandom. While the two transplants from the Northeast have embraced this somewhat foreign culture of âtailgating on Saturdays and over abundant school spirit,â as Santore puts it, her allegiance lies with her alma mater.
âAt Muhlenberg, I had the opportunity to speak up and take on things that probably would have been way too intimidating for me to do at a large school,â she says. 
She ran for student government, for example, and she felt comfortable enough with her professors to challenge and question them. Santore was a business major, and she recounts negotiating with one professor in that department, saying, âWhat youâre asking us to memorize seems irrelevant. Itâs a lot of details we wonât apply elsewhere, but we do need to practice the application of those details, so can we have an open-book test?â He asked her to write up an argument supporting her position. She did, and it convinced him.
âMuhlenberg helped spark a fire in me; that ability to challenge the status quo, not everyone likes it or is comfortable doing it,â Santore says. âBut you canât make headway or drive innovation if you keep doing the same things over and over again.â
Santore, who works at The Coca-Cola Company as their senior integrated marketing content manager, was named last month to one of Adweekâs Young Influentials lists, 10 Young Talents Who Are Defining the Next Generation of Marketing. Her job requires her to think creatively about one of the most well-established brands in the world to tell a unified story across a multitude of platforms and screens.
âOur wildly successful Share A Coke campaign is an exampleâthe idea you can find your name on the iconic Coca-Cola contour bottle. Itâs my job to help bring the story of Share A Coke to life and think through what that campaign looks like on TV, on social media, on packaging, on mobile devices, et cetera,â Santore says. âEach element is a piece of the larger story delivering different dimensions of what it means to Share A Coke.â
Santore arrived at Coca-Cola in 2012âher husband, a pediatric surgeon, was beginning his fellowship at Emory, and they planned to move back to NYC shortly after he finished. Santore remembers thinking, âIf weâre only going to be here in Atlanta for two years, I have to work at Coke. Iâm a big fan of their work and their creative thought leadership. I wanted to figure out their secret, thinking of it like a two-year masterâs program in marketing completely opposite from my previous work in startups.â Instead, they both enjoyed the south so muchâand excelled at their jobs so muchâthat theyâre still there, five years later.
âItâs very difficult to move into a 100-plus-year-old company like Coca-Cola and be the marketer that she is,â says Sam Laposata, part-time lecturer in accounting, business, economics and finance whom Santore recalls as a mentor. âIf I were starting a business, I would hire Kate. Iâm not even sure for what, just to have her there, because sheâs such a hardworking, bright, innovative person.â
When Santore was a student, she says, her rapport with Laposata extended beyond the classroom. âWeâd go to lunch once a month and talk about current business challenges,â she says. âHe encouraged me to push, to think differently and not accept the status quo, which prepared me for some things I would encounter working in both the startup and corporate world.â
âThatâs one of the benefits of Muhlenberg,â she adds. âMy husband and I have some SEC jealousy, but I donât know if many of those students had the opportunity to have lunch monthly with one of their professors.â

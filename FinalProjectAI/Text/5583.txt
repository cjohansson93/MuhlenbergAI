teamwork leads women’s lax to ninth win


Less than three minutes remaining. Junior Ruth Morrongiello approaches Bryn Mawr’s goal and is about to hit her 100th goal … but instead she passes to 
Kimberly Seedor, who shapes up the final score, 19-5 for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team.

This situation illustrates the keys to the successful 2008 Mule campaign – unselfishness and teamwork. 

The statistics are striking. For sixth time this season, 



One of 11 Mules to find the back of the net against the Owls, sophomore Danielle Scarrone made the score 5-1 with her eighth goal of the season with 20:53 left in the first half.



Muhlenberg accumulated at least 10 assists, while prior to this season the squad had achieved this feat a total 
of eight times in 24 years.  

After scoring five goals in the game, Morrongiello came within one goal of reaching the century mark for career goals. The Lloyd Harbor, N.Y., native had a chance on 
several occasions to become the seventh Muhlenberg goal-scorer in triple digits, but fate had decided she wouldn’t do it against the Owls. 

The victory was a giant step toward first-ever Muhlenberg Centennial Conference playoff appearance as the team improved to 4-3 in the league with two matches remaining.

“We have the same outlook as before,” sophomore Amanda McGovern said. “We come out ready to fight for each victory. We’ve proved ourselves this season and showed that we can make an impact in our conference.”

The prolific Muhlenberg attack, which averages 14.64 goals per game, carved out another memorable offensive production.

“We kept our composure and were able to find the empty spot in the net,” said McGovern, who scored two goals.

At least on one occasion, McGovern didn’t need to seek that thoroughly as she converted a free-position shot on an empty net as Bryn Mawr’s goalkeeper Stephanie Hilton was 
called for a foul. 

Despite not having experienced a situation like this before, McGovern made the score 16-2 with 17:03 left in the game.

“There was a lot of pressure considering the goal was empty,” she said.

Although the Mules (9-3 overall) registered another big-margin win, they again showed they haven’t healed from the second-half syndrome. 
Having generated 14 goals during the first half (one short of the school record), Muhlenberg’s players were unable to conquer Bryn Mawr’s goal during a 10-minute span at the beginning of the second period.

“Coming out strong in the second half is something we definitely need to work on,” McGovern admitted.

Senior Taylor Armstrong contributed six points on three goals and three assists for the Mules, who maintained their flawless home record intact (5-0). 

Muhlenberg had a tangible advantage in draw controls, winning 21 and limiting Bryn Mawr to five. Freshman Lauren DeCarle and McGovern pitched in four draw controls apiece.

In the hope that it may be possible to bring Mohsin Hamid to campus this year, after his spring 2020 visit was postponed, the College is once again using his novel, Exit West, as a Campus Reads text. We hope that many classes will choose to engage with this novel throughout the year. Our 2020-2021 program, Engaging in Speech and Action, will offer an opening panel that reads the novel, not so much through the lens of borders and identityâlast yearâs themeâbut as, itself, a form of speech and action. An opening panel of faculty will offer their reflections on the novel in a video discussion that will be publicly released on September 18, 2020. Then, on September 25, 2020, an open discussion will be held during Common Hour (2-3:15 p.m.) via Zoom.
Faculty Panelists:



Emanuela Kucik, English and Africana Studies


Mohsin Hashim, Political Science


Dawn Lonsinger, English


Leticia Robles-Moreno, Theatre and Dance

 Virtual Campus Visit - November 12-13
Live Webinar Public Lecture - November 13 at 2 p.m.Zoom Link
âFrom 1989 to 1984: The Formation of Chinaâs High-Tech Totalitarianism,â a Scholars-at-Risk Guest Lecture with Teng Biao, human rights activist, academic lawyer and former lecturer at the University of Politics and Law in Beijing, China.
Following Biao's public lecture, Muhlenberg's Assistant Professor of Anthropology Casey Miller and Professor of Media & Communication Jeff Pooley will lead an open discussion and a guided Q&A session.

 "Engaging in Speech and Action" will continue into the Spring 2021 semester with group discussions of chapters from Kathryn Sophia Belleâs (formerly Kathryn Gines) monograph, Hannah Arendt and the Negro Question, and additional contemporary scholarship on engaging speech and action.
About "Engaging in Speech and Action"Hannah Arendt, following Aristotle, argued that the capacity to speak and act in the world constitutes distinctly human capabilities. Increasingly our moment, and our campus, is defined by growing concern about ways we impose on others and on ourselves limits to our capacity to speak and to act. In order to foster the capacity to speak and act in a time of increasing polarization, technological complexity and political uncertainty, this Center for Ethics program will support programs designed to engage the community in a series of events and development workshops that explicitly seek to build and foster speech and action.

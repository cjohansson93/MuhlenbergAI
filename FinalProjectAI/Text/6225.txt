Women's Basketball Runs Past Greyhounds
 Tuesday, November 15, 2011 - page 2







					 


After she underwent knee surgery that forced her to sit out her entire junior season, it would have been nice for Kimberly Mui to ease her way back into playing form when the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team opened up the 2011-12 campaign.

Not a chance.

Like her teammates, Mui ran up and down the court at full speed, playing pressure defense and fast-paced offense, as the Mules made their opening a successful one with an 87-78 win at Moravian.

Junior Alita Zabrecky scored a career-high 25 points to 




Senior Kathleen Naddaff had four points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots.



go along with 11 rebounds, and senior Alexandra Chili added 24 points, moving into second place on the
program’s all-time scoring list.

And although Mui’s numbers (two points, three rebounds in 11 minutes) may have paled in comparison, her hustle and energy were key factors in the Mules making things difficult for the Greyhounds. During one sequence in the first half, she jumped high to keep an offensive rebound alive, then dove on the floor for the ball and called timeout.

“It was amazing,” said Mui of playing her first game in 20 months. “It was just awesome.”

Chili was awesome in the first half, scoring 16 points in 




A jumper with 6:23 left in the second half gave Mui her first points since the 2010 Centennial Conference championship game.



only 13 minutes of playing time. Her three-pointer with 15:52 left pushed her over 1,500 points for her career,
and her free throw at the 11:38 mark moved her past Lauren Boyle (2006-09) on the scoring chart. Chili finished the game with 1,521 points.

Four of her points came in a 9-0 run that extended Muhlenberg’ lead from 21-20 to 30-20 with 6:30 left in the half. The Mules led by as many as 15 in the first half, but Moravian closed out on a 9-0 run to go into the locker room down only six.

Muhlenberg attempted 50 field goals, forced 22 turnovers and sent 15 players into the game in the first half.

“We love this style. It gives everyone an opportunity to play,” said Mui, who was the 12th Mule into the game when she entered with just 4:41 elapsed. “It’s very beneficial to us, because other teams aren’t as deep as we are and we can wear them down – especially since we’re so athletic.”

The Mules upped their edge to 13 two-and-a-half minutes into the second half and maintained a comfortable lead the rest of the game. Moravian drew within seven around the two-minute mark, but Muhlenberg made enough free throws to ice the win.

Zabrecky scored 15 of her points in the second half. Eight of her 11 rebounds were on the offensive end. Sophomore Erin Laney scored a career-high 10 points, sophomore Leeann Lanza pulled down 11 rebounds, and freshman Hannah Rushcontributed nine points and four assists in her debut.

All in all, a good start.

“I think we played really in certain stretches, and then at other times we let up and didn’t play as well,” said Mui. “We can get better and keep improving.”

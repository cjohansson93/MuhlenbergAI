grube named to academic all-america team



Senior kicker Jordon Grube of the Muhlenberg football team was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-America second team, selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

A biology major, Grube was second on the Centennial Conference-champion Mules with 51 points. He converted 30 of 34 extra-point tries and made seven field goals, the biggest a 38-yarder with 4:37 remaining for the go-ahead points in Muhlenberg’s 31-21 win against Salisbury in the first round of the NCAA playoffs. He was named CC player of the week after recovering his own onside kick in the Mules’ title-clinching win at Ursinus.

Grube finished his career with 128 points, the second-most by a kicker in team history. His 24 field goals were three short of the school record.

To be eligible for Academic All-America honors, a student-athlete must be a varsity starter or key reserve, maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.20 on a scale of 4.00, have reached sophomore athletic and academic standings at his current institution and be nominated by his sports information director. Since the program’s inception in 1952, CoSIDA has bestowed Academic All-America honors on more than 14,000 student-athletes in Divisions I, II, III and NAIA covering all NCAA championship sports.

Grube is the 10th Muhlenberg football player to be named to the Academic All-America team, the first since Tony Orazi in 1998.

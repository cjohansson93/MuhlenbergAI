women’s lacrosse beaten at ursinus





Sophomore Allisyn Vachon makes one of her 13 saves.


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team missed out on a chance to clinch a Centennial Conference playoff berth, losing 14-11 at Ursinus.

With one game remaining in the regular season, the Mules (9-3, 5-3) are still in good shape for the playoffs. They are tied for third place with Dickinson, but with a win
against Washington at home on Saturday, they will clinch the third seed for the playoffs. Even if Muhlenberg loses to Washington, it would win tiebreakers against
every other contending team except Ursinus, which can tie the Mules only if it beats No. 5 Gettysburg.

Muhlenberg scored six straight goals over a span of 22:26 to open up a 6-3 lead on Ursinus (5-10, 4-4), but the home team responded with a 10-2 run to take over.

Junior Amanda McGovern scored three goals, and senior Ruth Morrongiello recorded seven draw controls.

points with wins at No. 3 doubles and No. 6 singles.

Women’s lacrosse bows in first roundof CC playoffs 


	Although the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team had never played a playoff game before,  it showed prominent maturity until the middle of the second half in the opening round of the Centennial Conference Tournament against McDaniel ... but then ran out of gas, dropping a 22-16 decision.

	The two teams had no secrets as 
	


In her last game, senior Marissa Capuano recorded team highs of three ground balls, three draw controls and two caused turnovers.



	they had played just four days earlier in the last game of the CC regular season, with the Green Terror coming out victorious. Despite the fact that in both cases McDaniel celebrated after the final whistle, Muhlenberg displayed two different faces.

	Unlike Saturday's contest, the Mules started out 
	


For the second year in a row, Hiller scored at least one goal in every game. She will enter her senior season with a school-record streak of 33 consecutive games with a goal.



	motivated and disciplined on both ends of the field, jumping out to a 6-2 lead 10 minutes into the game. McDaniel initiated a comeback and by halftime the score was tied, 8-8.

	The spectators witnessed a seesaw affair as play resumed in the second half with the teams exchanging goals, converting nearly every possession they had. 

	After the 10-minute mark of the second period, the Green Terror steadily took control of the game and Brittany Lines broke a 12-12 tie, sparking a 4-0 run for McDaniel. The Mules attempted to organize a turnaraound, but whenever they cut the deficit, their opponents were striking back.  

	McDaniel’s Erinn Hopkins was practically unstoppable as she turned in a rare eight-goal performance, five of which after halftime. 

	For the Mules, freshman Rachael Goldstein, sophomore Amanda McGovern and junior Sara Hiller pitched in hat tricks. 

	In her last collegiate game, senior Taylor Armstrong became Muhlenberg’s all-time leader in assists. Entering the contest one assist behind former leader Lynsey Caldwell (2000-03), Armstrong dished out four to leave a new mark on Mule record book, taking the leadership with 88 career helpers.

Muhlenberg also shattered the school record for scoring average in a season, finishing at 15.5 goals per game. The old mark, 13.87, was set in 2003.

	Wrapping up a season to remember, the Mules finished with an 11-5 record, the best in program history.

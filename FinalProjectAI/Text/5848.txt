Soccer Shut Out


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team fell from the ranks of the unbeaten, losing 5-0 at home to third-ranked Messiah.

The Falcons (5-0), who have been to the national semifinals four times in the last five years, held a 2-0 lead before scoring with 1:13 left in the first half. They blew the game
wide open with a pair of goals 32 seconds apart early in the second half.

There were a couple of close calls for the Mules (2-1-2). Five minutes into the second half, sophomore 
Christina O’Grady forced the goalie to make a diving save, and on the
ensuing corner kick freshman Valerie Patriarca hit the crossbar. O’Grady hit the crossbar late in the game.

The Moravian field hockey team scored two goals in the last 16 minutes to come from behind and beat Muhlenberg, 2-1.

The Mules (3-2) took a 1-0 lead late in the first half when senior Lauren Rutt made a run through the circle and, as she was falling down, sent a reverse-stick cross
toward the goal. The ball deflected off a Greyhound defender and into the cage for Rutt’s sixth career goal.

Moravian (2-2) tied the score with 15:38 left and went ahead eight minutes later, holding on for their first win against Muhlenberg since 1997. The result tied the Matte Award standings for the 2007-08 year at 1-1.

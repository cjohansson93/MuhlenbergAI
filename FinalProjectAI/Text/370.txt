Admission Requirements for Masterâs Degree Programs
Muhlenberg College admits applicants whose profile (a combination of prior academic performance, career accomplishments, community engagement through volunteerism, and other leadership activities) demonstrates the greatest potential for graduate study and contribution to their profession and diverse society. 
Applicants for the Organizational Leadership (MOL) Masterâs Degree will typically have two or more years work experience. We also recommend that entering students have had some college or working experience related to leadership, such as in human resources, planning, management, public administration, and/or organizational psychology. College seniors or recent graduates may meet this requirement through appropriate professional experiences, such as internships, summer work, externships, athletics, creative activities, and projects.
Applicants to the Applied Analytics for Organizations (MAA) Master's Degree will have successfully completed statistics and calculus courses within the last five years. For those who do not meet this requirement or who desire to refresh their knowledge and skills, we offer a half-unit pre-course covering mathematical concepts integral to a studentâs success in the masterâs program. College seniors may enroll in the Masters of Applied Analytics program in conjunction with their Bachelorâs degree with certain graduate courses fulfilling their undergraduate and graduate requirements.
Admission decisions are based on many factors, such as:

Prior academic degree and official transcripts
A personal statement addressing their personal characteristics acquired skills, and intellectual abilities, including preparation in the desired field of study connecting graduate/professional goals with the academic program (see instructions below)
Relevant work experience represented by rÃ©sumÃ© or curriculum vitae
Interview with our VP Executive Director or Dean of Graduate Studies or other graduate program adviser 

Personal Statement Instructions
We are interested in learning about your personal characteristics (ethical leadership, perseverance, emotional intelligence), acquired skills (research, writing, presenting), and intellectual abilities (creativity, area of knowledge, analytical thought). It should be written in an essay format with a balanced tone between personal and professional and between 450 and 750 words.   
Muhlenberg Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students who wish to apply will need to secure approvals from their academic advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies before the end of their junior year. 
Admission Requirements for Graduate Certificate Programs
To be considered for acceptance to certificate programs, applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree at an accredited institution. Within the past five years, applicants for the certificate in Applied Analytics for Organizations must have passed a college-level course in Statistics with a minimum grade of B.
Note that applicants to graduate certificate programs will need: 

Prior academic degree and unofficial transcripts
Personal statement including preparation in the desired field of study and connecting graduate/professional goals with the academic program
Relevant work experience represented by resume or curriculum vitae 
English language proficiency (see below)

Subsequent Admission to Masterâs Degree Program
Candidates for admission to a masterâs program who have completed the corresponding graduate certificate with a final cumulative GPA of 3.0 may receive preference. They should schedule a personal interview with the Executive Director or Dean of Graduate Studies and follow the application procedures for the masterâs degree.
General notices
The satisfaction of minimum entrance requirements does not guarantee admission since the number of qualified applicants exceeds the number of places available.  Note that academic performance is not the sole criterion for admission to the College. The College may evaluate a person's behavior and background to determine their ability to maintain the standards of academic and professional conduct expected at the College. An evaluation may take into consideration current behavior and performance as well as past experiences and actions. All documents submitted to the School of Graduate Studies Admissions become the property of Muhlenberg College and will not be returned.

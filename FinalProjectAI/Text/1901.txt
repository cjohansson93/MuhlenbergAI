Mark R. Emerick is an assistant professor in the Education Department responsible for teaching courses in social foundations of education, curriculum & instruction, sociolinguistics, methods for teaching emergent bilingual students,and first year writing. 
Mark began his career as an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher in Allentown School District, Pennsylvania. During his tenure as a public school teacher, he taught all levels of ESL from grades 7-12 and high school sheltered English language arts, wrote high school ESL curriculum, prepared and presented professional developments for mathematics and social studies teachers, and worked for the Pennsylvania Department of Education on the ELL Overlay for secondary mathematics and the Keystone Project-Based Assessment in nonfiction. More recently, Mark served as an editorial assistant on the Journal of Language, Identity, and Education and as a leadership coach for a Federal Department of Education Professional Development Grant aimed at transforming high schools in the School District of Philadelphia to better serve bilingual and multilingual students. His recent work in public education involves researchâpractice partnerships and professional development aimed to build and sustain equity initiatives supporting emergent biilngual students educational opportunities and access.
Mark's research interests involve examining how school structures affect emergent bilingualsâ educational equity and access to opportunities to attain college and career readiness. As an ethnographer, he works to understand the organizational processes that affect emergent bilinguals' access to and experiences in career and technical education (CTE) programs. This research draws on critical race theory among other critical theories, to examine inequalities in the education system and to understand the ways in which identities, beliefs, linguistic and political ideologies, and language education policies facilitate and/or restrict emergent bilingualsâ opportunities to achieve college and career readiness. More recently, he has began examining the role of school leaders their decision-making processes in expanding and/or restricting emergent bilinguals' access to college and career readiness opportunities. Broadly, his research has implications for educational practice and local, state, and federal policy.
His dissertation, A Critical Race Theory Perspective on English Learners' Experience in Career and Technical Education: Access, Equity, and Opportunity to Learn, was awarded the Dr. Rita Wolotkiewicz Phi Delta Kappa award for outstanding professional achievement by Temple University's College of Education and was selected as a finalist for the 2021 Dissertation Award by the Second Language Research special interest group of the American Educational Research Association. 
As a teacher educator, Mark is dedicated to preparing prospective teachers to be equitable educators who can meet the needs of all students and advocate for students from a range of socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. Equally, he is committed to engaging students in research opportunities which will prepare them to be dynamic and responsive educators and future educational researchers and applied linguists.

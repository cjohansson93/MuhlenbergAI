WOMENS BASKETBALLS STREAK ENDS AT 28
 


Just when it looked like the Muhlenberg womens basketball team had won a one-point game against McDaniel for the fifth straight time, it hadnt.




In addition to her out-of-bounds save, Clawson sank two clutch free throws with 28.4 seconds left in overtime to bring the Mules to within one. She is a perfect 13-for-13 from the line this season.



Junior Kelly McKeon completed a remarkable three-point play with 7.5 seconds remaining in overtime to put the Mules up one, but McDaniel converted the tying and go-ahead free throws with 2.5 seconds left to win, 72-71.

The loss snapped Muhlenbergs 28-game winning streak against Centennial Conference opponents and knocked it out of at least a share of first place for the first time since 2007-08. But the Mules (8-2, 6-1), who climbed to ninth in Division III in the D3hoops.com poll earlier in the day, wont have to wait long to change that; they travel to unbeaten and 21st-ranked Gettysburg (13-0, 8-0) on Thursday night with a chance at a virtual tie for first.



Men Fall in First Big Test





The Muhlenberg mens basketball team suffered its first Centennial Conference loss of the season, falling to No. 11 Franklin & Marshall, 80-58.

The loss dropped the Mules (7-5, 5-1) into a three-way tie for first place in the CC with Franklin & Marshall (11-2, 5-1) and Gettysburg (7-5, 5-1). Muhlenberg will have a chance to at least bring the tie down to two teams when it travels to Gettysburg on Thursday.

F&M led the whole way in this game, entering halftime leading by 14. The Diplomats lead swelled to as high as 26 in the second half.

Senior Peter Barnes led the Mules with 17 points on 8-for-11 shooting and also pulled down seven rebounds.

The game also continued the trend of tight battles between these teams after a brief three-game hiatus. It was the seventh time in the last eight seasons Muhlenberg and McDaniel have played a one-point contest, and the fifth meeting that went to overtime.

McDaniel (8-4, 7-2) nearly stopped the Mules on their final possession, but freshman Kate Clawson made a fantastic save on a jumper headed out of bounds to give Muhlenberg another chance while trailing 70-68.

Sophomore Alexandra Chili found McKeon streaking down the lane, and as McKeon went up for a left-handed layup, she was hit hard, but still banked in the bucket, tying the game with a chance to take the lead.

After a McDaniel timeout, McKeon calmly sank the free throw, putting the Mules ahead, 71-70. But a foul call with 2.5 seconds on the clock sent the Green Terrors leading scorer to the line with a chance to give it the lead. She hit both free throws, and McKeons desperation heave as time expired was off the mark.

McKeon was nearly the hero at the end of regulation, as well. With the score tied, 56-56, with 1:10 to play, she found a wide-open lane to the basket and drew a foul. She sank both free throws to give the Mules the lead, but after both squads traded turnovers, McDaniel hit a jumper with 1.4 seconds to play to send the game to overtime.

McKeon and Chili both posted double-doubles. McKeon had 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Chili scored 14 points, pulled down a career-high 10 boards and had a game-best seven assists. Junior Sheila Cook poured in a game-high 21 points.

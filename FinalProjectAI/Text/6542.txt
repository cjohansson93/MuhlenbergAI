The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team closed out its fall schedule by competing at the ITA Southeast Regional at Mary Washington this weekend.

Of the eight Mules who participated in the tournament, seven won at least one match.

Sophomore Sharen Resnikoff (left) reached the final in the Blue 3 singles draw. She won her first three matches, two against opponents from Centennial Conference rivals Franklin & Marshall and Johns Hopkins, in straight sets before falling to a Virginia Wesleyan player in the championship match. 

Resnikoff, who compiled a 5-1 singles record in the fall, also teamed with senior Amanda von Taube to win a first-round match in the championship doubles draw. The Mule duo was defeated by the second-seeded team from Carnegie Mellon.

The doubles team of sophomore Ashlee Ludwig and freshman Emily Mirkin finished third in the Blue 4 doubles draw. After falling to a Franklin & Marshall twosome in the first round, the Muhlenberg pair won its next two matches, 8-0 and 8-3.

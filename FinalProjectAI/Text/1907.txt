The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program) 
The Yellow Ribbon Program is a provision of the Post- 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (also known as The Post 9/11 GI BillÂ®) to make additional funds available to qualified veterans.
Only individuals entitled to the maximum benefit rate (based on service requirements) under the Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ® may receive this supplemental funding. Beginning with the 2022-2023 Academic Year, the Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ® will pay up to $26,281.37. per academic year for tuition and fee expenses at a private university.
"How Much Can I Receive Under this Program?"
The full-time student will receive $26,281.37 from the Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ®. 
Muhlenberg College will then award up to $7,000 as the collegeâs match of the Yellow Ribbon and the Veteranâs administration will match the Muhlenberg College contribution of up to $7,000. These awards are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.
Awards will cover a maximum of 8 semesters of full-time study for incoming freshmen. The maximum length of the award may be amended for incoming transfer students based on the number of earned hours accepted for credit towards their Muhlenberg College degree program.
Awards will be pro-rated for students who enroll on a part-time basis. (Yellow Ribbon increases the amount of tuition available, but does not increase the length of time the benefit is available). 
State Grant Funds and Muhlenberg College merit scholarships and need-based grants/scholarships are not awarded for a specific piece of your educational expenses so they are NOT included in the calculation.
Therefore, a studentâs tuition and fees will be determined, then the Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ® of $26,281.37 is deducted. The remaining balance of tuition and fees not covered by these grants will be divided in half and capped at $14,000. Half of the remaining balance will be covered by the Veteranâs Administration Yellow Ribbon Match. The other half will be covered by the Muhlenberg College Yellow Ribbon Match.
No combination of Veteranâs Benefits, Muhlenberg College Grants/Scholarships or Tuition Benefits may exceed the Total Cost of Attendance (Tuition, Fees, Room, Board, Books and Supplies, Transportation and Miscellaneous Expenses). Please note that students receiving merit, need-based and/or any tuition benefits may see an adjustment to those awards due to the receipt of Veteranâs Benefits or Yellow Ribbon Funds. 

 EXAMPLE for Continuing Studies students taking two day classes and three evening classes, each semester:
 $34,580.00 Tuition and Fees-$26,281.37 Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ®$ 8,298.63 Balance ($7,417.19 divided by 2 = $4,149.32)
$4,149.32âVeteranâs Administration Yellow Ribbon Match$4,149.32âMuhlenberg College Yellow Ribbon Match

 Lorena Nash, Muhlenberg Collegeâs Student Data Verification Specialist is the Collegeâs School Certifying Official (SCO) for all programs administered by the Veteran's Administration.
Veterans interested in establishing their eligibility for this program should initiate an application through the Veteran's Administration's website.
The Veterans Administration will send a Certificate of Eligibility to each applicant. Students should submit a copy of their Certificate of Eligibility to Lorena Nash immediately upon receipt. Remember, funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.
Lorena Nash will inform the Office of Financial Aid of the studentâs eligibility. This office will post an estimated award to the student's account.
The total award posted on a student's Financial Aid Online Account and Capstone bill will be broken down into three components:

Estimated Amount to be paid for the academic year by the Post 9/11 G.I. BillÂ® (cannot exceed $26,281.37)
"Yellow Ribbon" Match Amount to be paid by the Veterans Administration (cannot exceed $7,000)
"Yellow Ribbon" Match Amount to be paid by Muhlenberg College (cannot exceed $7,000)

The Veteran's Administration will forward their portion of the award based on information on the enrollment certification form (22-1999) submitted by the SCO.
Renewal Requirements: Recipients will be expected to meet the satisfactory academic progress policy standards applicable to students participating in all other federal student aid programs.
Students who withdraw from Muhlenberg College will forfeit their spot in the program and will have to re-apply for reinstatement if they re-enroll. This policy also applies to students who take a leave of absence. Exceptions will be made for any recipients who are recalled to active duty.
Refunds If Recipients Withdraw: Schools are required to report enrollment information to the Veteran's Administration. Our program participation agreement with the Veteran's Administration mandates that we process refunds under the following circumstances:

Should a student enroll in courses, begin attending classes and subsequently drop out, the school shallfollow their current refund policy and deal directly with the student.
Should the change in enrollment cause a V.A. debt, V.A. will collect from the student. This could result in adiminished payment from VA for the following semester.
Should a student enroll in courses and never attend classes, the school shall refund to V.A. the full amountof payments received on behalf of the student.

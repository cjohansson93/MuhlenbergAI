Threes & D Lock Up Two Seed for Women's Basketball



Despite a delayed start due to travel issues, the Muhlenberg women's basketball team did not seem fazed in defeating McDaniel 78-50 and securing the second seed for the Centennial Conference Tournament.


	 Wednesday, February 22, 2017  09:56 AM

The Mules (18-7, 15-5 CC) shot a season-best 10-17 from three-point range (58.8 percent) while holding the Green Terror (11-14, 9-11 CC) to a 31.7 percent clip (19-60) and 0-for-6 day from long range. Muhlenberg spread the ball on offense, dishing out 20 assists as a team for the seventh time this season. Fourteen different Mules scored in the game and they forced 13 turnovers as a team on defense. With the win, Muhlenberg clinched the second seed for next weekend's Centennial Conference playoffs, winning a tiebreaker with Dickinson who also finished 15-5 in league play after its win over Washington College. Haverford had already clinched the first seed and will host Friday's two semifinal contests as well as the championship game Saturday.

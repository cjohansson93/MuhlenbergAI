Kein Earns All-America Status; Baseball Swept

Wrestling



Senior Rob Kein became the fourth All-American in Muhlenberg wrestling history by going 2-1 on the first day of the NCAA Division III Championships.

Kein, seeded sixth, dropped his first bout by 3-2 decision but came back to decision wrestlers from Concordia (Wis.) and Rhode Island College in the consolation bracket
to guarantee a top-eight finish. Kein will wrestle at least two more bouts on the second day of the tournament to determine his final place.

Senior Matt Horn came up one win short of All-America, sandwiching a pin in between two losses to seeded opponents. 
The pin made him the fifth different wrestler in team history to win 30 bouts in a season. Horn finished the year 30-4 and ended his career with an 88-38 mark.

Four members of the Muhlenberg men’s track and field team combined to break one of the most impressive records in school history.

In 2003, a Mule distance medley relay team ran 10:01.59 at the ECAC Championships, smashing the previous school record by more than 15 seconds. It was the fastest time in Division III that season, and the team went on to earn All-America honors by finishing fifth at the NCAA Championships.

The time hadn’t been approached since, until the 2009 ECAC Championships. The foursome of senior Stuart Udis (right), freshman Peter Rice, sophomore Bobby Torphy and senior David Chorney crossed the finish line in 10:00.70 – the sixth-fastest time in Division III this season. The Muhlenberg team qualified provisionally for the NCAA Championships and will know on Sunday if it has made the field.

Chorney ran an incredible 4:11 split on the final leg, the 1,600 meters, and led until the last 100 meters, when a runner from host Tufts – spurred on by the home crowd – raced ahead to win by seven one-hundredths of a second.

The other Muhlenberg participant on the first day of the ECAC Championships, junior Alex Faust, finished seventh in the pole vault.

Library Technology Use Policy





Muhlenberg Collegeâs Information Technology Policies and Procedures apply to all computers and other referenced technology equipment in Trexler Library.
Computer Use
There are two computers available on A-level, the Quick Lookup Kiosks, for public use. These computers are intended for brief research needs and have a 20-minute time limit. All other computers throughout the library require a campus login. Trexler Library no longer has any computer labs, but there are computers all along A-level.
All library computers are equipped with an application that prevents files and changes from being saved. You will need to save any files you wish to keep to a flash drive or other cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
Wireless Access
All users of the Campus Network agree to Muhlenberg College's Electronic Communication Policy.  You agree implicitly to these terms by connecting to and using either of the Campus Networks. Campus visitors may bring their own devices and connect to the MuhlenbergGuest Network.
Laptops for Checkout
There are Chromebooks available for students, faculty, and staff to checkout. They may only be used in the library, and the checkout period is 4 hours. One renewal may be allowed. Fines will be accrued for late returns.
The laptops will not retain new files, so please do not save personal files to the hard drive. Personal files will not be recovered after reboot. You will need to save any files you wish to keep to a flash drive or other cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
Printing and Scanning
Ricoh Papercut printers are available throughout the library. Students, faculty, and staff may use their Muhlenberg ID cards to print.
Non-Muhlenberg patrons may use the vending color printer located near the Fulford Room. Items must be saved to a USB drive as either a PDF or JPEG for this printer.
There are two book scanners located on Level A. They are available for use without a Muhlenberg ID.   
Please visit Trexler Libraryâs Print, Copy, Scan Information Page for full details.
Mobile Collaboration Stations
The mobile collaboration stations are available for student, faculty, and staff use. No reservations are required. The units may be moved anywhere in the library.
One Button Studio
The One Button Studio is available for student, faculty, and staff use. To make a reservation, visit our online booking page.
Collaboration Room
Trexler Libraryâs Collaboration Room is open for students, faculty, and staff use whenever the library is open. To make a reservation, visit our online booking page. The room is open for use when it is not reserved, but priority will be given to groups. Individuals may be asked to work elsewhere if there is a group waiting to use the room.

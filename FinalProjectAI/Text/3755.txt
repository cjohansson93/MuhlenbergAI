field hockey falls in strokes




In a season in which it has yet to enjoy a win, the Muhlenberg field hockey suffered what may be its most difficult loss, falling to Moravian on penalty strokes.

The Mules (0-6) dominated play throughout regulation, owning a 21-1 advantage in penalty corners and a 12-1 edge in shots. The two overtime periods were
more evenly played, but still did not produce any goals.

The 0-0 score after 100 minutes was a first for Muhlenberg since 1994, when such games ended as ties. But now ties are broken by penalty strokes. Moravian
(4-3) went first, and sophomore Kristen Dornenburg (right) dove to make the save. After a Mule miss, the Greyhounds were successful
on their next try. Muhlenberg tied the shootout at 1-1 when freshman Erin Cummings lofted a nice stroke into the top of the netting in
the fourth round.

In the fifth round, Moravian made its stroke and Muhlenberg's was saved, giving the Greyhounds a 2-1 win in the shootout and only their second victory 
against Muhlenberg in the last 13 years. The Greyhounds also took a 2-1 lead in the 2010-11 Matte Award standings. The next event is a women's tennis
match at Muhlenberg on September 30.

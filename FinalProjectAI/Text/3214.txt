Women’s Soccer Bows in CC Semis


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team gave No. 7 Johns Hopkins all it could handle in the semifinal round of the Centennial Conference playoffs before losing 1-0 in double overtime.

The Blue Jays (16-0-3) headed in a corner kick 2:21 into the second overtime to advance to the CC final for the fifth straight year. 

Muhlenberg ended up with an 11-5-4 record, three of the five losses coming to top-10 teams.

The Mules held a 6-4 advantage in shots in the first half, and two of those shots, both in the final 10 minutes of the half, hit the crossbar. Hopkins hit the crossbar early in the second half.

For the third year in a row, senior Rob Kein of the Muhlenberg wrestling team opened the season by winning his bracket at the Monarch Invitational, hosted by King’s.

Kein, who won at 141 a sophomore and 149 last winter, successfully defended 

his title at the higher weight class, and he did it in dramatic fashion, scoring a 4-2 overtime decision against the top-seeded wrestler from Wilkes in the final. Kein was seeded second, and his opponent was a national qualifier last year.

Kein opened the tournament in impressive fashion, capturing his first two bouts by technical fall. In the semifinals, he scored a 10-8 decision against the third seed.

Kein (right) has six tournament titles for his career.

Senior Matt Horn also made a splash at the first tournament of the year, placing third at 197. He dropped his first bout, a one-point decision to an unseeded wrestler who went on to finish second in the bracket, but came back to win five bouts in the consolation bracket.

The Mules finished sixth out of seven teams in a strong field.

Killing Scores 33 in Men's Basketball Loss

Another monumental performance by Malique Killing wasn’t enough for the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team to earn a season sweep of Johns Hopkins. The Blue Jays led wire to wire and held off a second-half push by the Mules to claim an 81-70 victory in Baltimore.

Three days removed from a career-high-tying 38-point explosion at Ursinus, the junior guard put on another show, leading all scorers with 33 points on 13-of-24 shooting. Johns Hopkins (10-7, 7-3) countered with balance – five players scored in double figures and a sixth finished with nine points – and three-point shooting, knocking down six of its nine treys in the second half to outlast the Mules (11-6, 6-4) and move into sole possession of fourth place in the Centennial Conference with their sixth win in seven games.




Wrestling Drops Home Openers




Competing at home for the first time this season, the Muhlenberg wrestling team dropped its first two Centennial Conference matches of the
year. Forfeiting the six highest weight classes, the Mules fell to McDaniel, 51-6, and Stevens, 49-3.

Muhlenberg’s lone win in a contested bout came from sophomore Che Chengsupanimit against Stevens in a 149-pound thriller that came down to the
final seconds. Chengsupanimit trailed 6-5 on the scoreboard and was on the bottom with time winding down, although due to his large advantage
in riding time, the match would have gone into overtime tied at 6-6. But with less than five seconds on the clock, Chengsupanimit scored
a reversal – his second of the bout – to win, 8-6.

Killing, who moved into 10th on Muhlenberg’s all-time scoring list, became just the third player in program history to record back-to-back 30-point games. Dennis Adams was the first, accomplishing the feat during the 1993-94 season, and Mike Bernardini joined the club in the 2007-08 campaign. It was Killing’s fourth such outing of the season, and the seventh of his career, the second most in Muhlenberg history.



Killing was named Muhlenberg’s MVP of the game as part of Hopkins’ 13th annual Wall-O’Mahony Alumni Basketball Weekend, named in honor of two former Blue Jay teammates who lost their lives in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Killing is pictured with Avery Wall (daughter of Glen Wall) and Bobby O’Mahony (nephew of Matt O’Mahony)

Senior Kevin Hargrove, the 2012 MVP, fell just shy of a double-double, finishing with nine points and a game-high 13 rebounds. Freshman John Hunter gave Muhlenberg a big lift off the bench, pairing a career-high eight points with eight rebounds, two blocks and a steal.

In a battle of teams that were eliminated in the semifinals of the CC playoffs a year ago, Muhlenberg found itself playing catchup the whole way as Johns Hopkins jumped out to a 9-2 advantage. After trailing by as many as 15, the Mules got as close as three in the second half, pulling to within 61-58 with 7:21 left on the strength of a 10-0 run, but Johns Hopkins stopped the bleeding with a three-pointer.

Muhlenberg College has embarked on a strategic planning process that will involve much of the College communityâfaculty, staff, students and trusteesâin outlining institutional priorities to guide the future work of the institution. A Strategic Planning Group (SPG) consisting of faculty, staff and students are leading this effort, with opportunities for members of the community to help shape the Collegeâs future. We have also engaged the Huron Consulting Group, the largest educational consulting group in the nation, to assist us in this planning process.
The Middle States Commission on Higher Education reaffirmed the Collegeâs accreditation earlier this summer and, while the report praised the College in most areas, the Visiting Team (and the Steering Committee, itself) made several recommendations that will inform the strategic planning process. A great amount of quantitative and qualitative data was gathered in the reaccreditation process, and we are using that data as a broad foundation of information for this strategic planning process. Of course the SPG will gather more data, consult with the College community and seek input from different departments as we build the next Plan for Muhlenberg College.
Multiple opportunities for community involvement in the planning process exist. Departments, committees and student groups compiled SWOT analyses as part of the planning work. SPG is organizing a Community Planning Event on November 2 to collect strategic ideas from all segments of our community. The Group will also issue regular updates on its work via this website as the planning process continues. We ask for your ideas, your suggestions and your support as we engage in this important work.

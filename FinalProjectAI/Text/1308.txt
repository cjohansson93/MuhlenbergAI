The Men of Color Network is an organization designed to create a space for men of colorâbe they students, faculty or staffâto embrace, support and express themselves.
One of the goals of this organization is to help forge new relationships across campus and beyond, allowing members to develop a set of networking skills that can help them successfully navigate the job market and life after graduation.
But just as essential are the ways in which the group seeks to provide a better understanding of history through the lens of marginalized persons, while also developing a critical understanding of their male identity and privilege  in an effort to dismantle  privilege and knowledge of methodologies to dismantle sexism and misogyny.
At the heart of the organization, is an emphasis on creating an atmosphere of fellowship and family for members.
2021-2022 Leadership
President: Matthew McCray '24
Faculty/Staff Advisor: RaeVaughn Gardner-Williams, senior assistant director of admissions and coordinator of multicultural recruitment

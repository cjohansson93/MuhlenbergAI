Thinking about auditioning for Dance?



Dance Interviews & Auditions â for high school seniors & transfer students
Dancers are encouraged to attend one of our Open House events and engage with the Dance faculty and students. While an audition is not required for admission to the college or the dance major, a strong interview and audition can improve your chances of admission, and an audition is required for students who wish to be considered for a talent scholarship.
We are planning two Open House events in person during the 2021-22 Academic Year, with one date remaining:     Saturday, Jan. 15, 2022
CLICK HERE to register for an in-person Open House!
This is an opportunity for you to take classes with our faculty, talk with current students, tour the facilities, and audition for a talent grant if you wish.
If you're unable to attend one of our Open House dates, video auditions and Zoom interviews can be arranged. Here are the guidelines for video auditions.
See a show!
Come see us in action! All prospective students and their families are welcome to attend the spring Departmental dance production, In Motion, featuring choreography by acclaimed faculty and guest artists. Performances are March 31 â April 2, Thursday and Friday at 8 pm and Saturday at 2 & 8 pm. For free tickets, please fill out this ticket request form.
 
How to Audition:
Whether you're auditioning in person at an Open House event or remotely, here are guidelines you will want to follow in preparing for the audition.

Prepare your audition carefully

Allow plenty of time, and be sure to read and follow the Audition Guidelines carefully.
Guidelines for your in-person audition can be found here.
Video Audition Guidelines are available here.


Gather supporting materials:

RÃ©sumÃ©   Your rÃ©sumÃ© should reflect work experience, extra-curricular activities, volunteer work, and other experience â both arts-related and non-arts-related. Please convert all files to PDFs.
Current photo   For identification purposes only. It can be a headshot, school photo, or casual photo, as long as it's recent, your face is clear, you're the only person in the photo, and you look more or less like you do now. It should be at least 400 pixels on a side, and larger is better.

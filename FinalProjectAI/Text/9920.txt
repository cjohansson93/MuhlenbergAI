In the Fall 2020 semester, Muhlenberg voice faculty offered three MasterClass style workshops. The goal was to work with current students to develop skills and techniques to help them grow as musicians and performers. The three workshops will all be showcased here once the recordings are available:
Mark Moliterno, "YogaVoice"
YogaVoice is a unique, 21st Century pedagogical approach to understanding and embodying vocal and artistic wellness. YogaVoice training endeavors to develop the self-awareness and authenticity that leads to clear and honest self-expression.

Patricia Budlong, "Storytelling through the Screen"
Storytelling Through the Screen focuses on communicating the meaning of your song and the energy of your story across video conferencing platforms or self tape.
June Thomas, "Intro to Authentic Jazz Singing"
Intro to Authentic Jazz Singing is an opportunity for singers who are less familiar with jazz vocal concepts to sample techniques such as "rewriting" of existing melodies, back singing choices, and scat singing.

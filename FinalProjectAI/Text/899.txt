About Me: Originally hailing from the Bronx, NY, I joined the Muhlenberg community in September of 2016. I find joy watching my favorite sports teams play whenever I get a chance along with binge-watching various shows and movies while hanging with my dog Ace, who sometimes enjoys long walks, ice cream, and plenty of naps.
Advice for Prospective Students: While advising students on their college search process, I always recommend they first and foremost enjoy themselves. Thatâs most important! Secondly, after spending ample hours in the car with parents or family members visiting each campus, Iâd recommend creating a list of pros and cons of each institution that you visit while things are fresh on your mind, so you donât forget anything. Iâd also recommend exploring every opportunity a college youâre interested in has to offer. I firmly believe this will allow you to get the most insight into life as a student at any institution.
Favorite Food on Campus? When not traveling or at home reading applications, my favorite food while on campus is a cheesesteak or a chicken finger melt from the General's Quarters.

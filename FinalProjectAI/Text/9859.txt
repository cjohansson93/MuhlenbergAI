Click here if your question is about auditioning for the Dance Program.
What dance techniques are offered?
Course offerings include ballet, modern, jazz, tap, hip-hop, aerial, partnering, pointe, and African Dance.
Do you have Guest Artists offering master classes?
The program emphasizes exposure to diverse dance practices within dance genres â a significant aspect of which is our extensive Guest Artist program.
How many dance studios do you have, and what type of floors?
We have four dance studios, all with sprung wood floors. Three have a Marley overlay and one is natural wood. We also have a fully equiped Pilates studio.
What is the typical class size?
Between 12 and 25 students, depending on the course taught and the studio in which it is taught.
Are there musicians for the dance classes?
Yes, ballet and modern classes have live musicians.
Is there access to good medical personnel?
In addition to the college's medical facility and counseling center, the dance department has a resident physical therapist specializing in dance. We also have a strong relationship with several off-campus orthopedists and physical therapists.
What performance opportunities are available?
Each Departmental Season includes multiple dance concerts, one featuring choreography by guest artists and resident faculty, and others showcasing the work of advanced dance composition students. The season also features musical theatre productions with major dance components and frequent experimental dance-theatre collaborations.
Additionally, there is a series of informal dance concerts of student-choreographed works each semester, as well as several student ensembles and dance groups.
Does Muhlenberg participate in the American College Dance Association?
Yes! We regularly participate in conferences, and we have been selected five times to present at the National Festival, as well as numerous Gala concert presentations at the regional level. Read More!
What are the opportunities to view dance in the area?
Our location 90 miles from New York City and 45 miles from Philadelphia ideally situates us to see a wide spectrum of professional dance. There are also several colleges and universities in the area that regularly present dance touring companies.
If I were to major in dance, what other courses besides technique would I take?
All Muhlenberg students take a core liberal arts curriculum. In addition, dance majors have a choice of concentrations in Performance, Choreography, Dance Education, and/or Dance Science. Courses include Dance & Society, dance histories, anatomy and kinesiology, dance education and teaching dance technique, improvisation, Pilates, stagecraft, choreography, screendance, and a senior capstone research course. We work closely with students to advise them in choosing electives and cross-disciplinary studies to prepare for future careers in dance and related areas.
Is it possible to double-major?
One of the great things about studying Dance at Muhlenberg is that you also have the opportunity to broadly explore your other academic and performance interests at a world-class liberal arts institution. More than 70 percent of our Dance majors double-major. Popular second majors include theatre, biology, arts administration, business, and neuroscience. Find out more! 
 
How much can I expect to dance each week?
This is a personal choice, again determined with a faculty mentor in advising. Students interested in performing careers are likely to find themselves in two or three classes a day plus several hours of evening rehearsal. Conversely, a student interested in becoming a dance therapist might choose to only take one class a day and not be involved in performing at all.
Besides the courses in pedagogy, are there other ways to develop teaching skills?
Yes. We offer several different classroom opportunities for dance educators to practice the skills they have learned â both in the studio and in regional public schools.
Are there talent scholarships offered to incoming students?
Yes. An audition is required for consideration for a Muhlenberg Talent Grant or Baker Scholarship. Scholarships range in size from $1,000 to $4,000 per year depending on talent level.
What are the criteria for dance scholarships?
Dance scholarships are based on your current skills and your potential to contribute positively to the dance community at Muhlenberg. In addition to your past dance experiences, we place a high value on sustained commitment, generosity of spirit, and a desire to study dance in the context of a broad liberal arts education. Learn more about dance auditions.
What are Muhlenberg Dance Alumni doing?
Many dance majors go on to careers in performing, choreography, arts management, physical therapy, and teaching. Others bring the skills they learn as dance majors to other professions, while continuing to pursue their interest in dance avocationally. (See alumni profiles for more information)
I don't plan to major in dance, but want to continue dancing. What opportunities are open to me?
All dance classes are open to Muhlenberg students regardless of major. You may audition for all performances and performing ensembles provided you are actively studying dance at the college.
If I have questions about the program that aren't covered here, whom should I contact?
Please email faculty member Heidi Cruz-Austin, the Director of Dance Recruitment. Heidi can answer most of your questions, and can direct the rest of them to other faculty members and students.

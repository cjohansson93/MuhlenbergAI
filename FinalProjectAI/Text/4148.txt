McCaffrey, Siebold named players of the week




After helping lead their teams to successful weeks, a pair of Muhlenberg lacrosse players were honored by the Centennial Conference.

Senior Brent Siebold of the mens lacrosse team was named the conferences offensive player of the week, while freshman Kaitlyn McCaffrey of the womens lacrosse team grabbed defensive player of the week honors.

Siebold tied the school records for goals (7) and points (8) in the Mules 13-11 win over No. 19 Rensselaer on senior day. It was Muhlenbergs second win over a ranked team this season.

The programs active leading scorer, Siebold reached the 100-point mark for his career during the win over the Engineers. He currently ranks second on the schools all-time goals list (78) and fifth on the career points list (100).

McCaffrey picked up the defensive honor after helping the Mules go 2-0 on the week.

On Wednesday, she scooped up six ground balls and caused five turnovers as Muhlenberg held the conferences highest-scoring team, Swarthmore, to a season-low-tying seven goals.

McCaffrey also helped the Mules hold Bryn Mawr to single digits in a 20-9 win on Friday. She finished the week with 11 ground balls, seven caused turnovers and four draw controls.

The team leader in ground balls (39) and caused turnovers (32), McCaffrey ranks second in the conference in both categories and is in the top 25 in the country in caused turnovers.

Both teams are still in the hunt for the CC playoffs and have key games against Dickinson and Ursinus this week.

Benjamin Shaw  Class of 2007 Major in Theatre
Freelance Director





The day after graduation, I returned home to spend the summer as the assistant director for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera's six-show season. First stop: the national tour of Disney's High School Musical, where I formed important relationships that led to a big moment at the end of August: I moved to NYC to work as the executive assistant to the president of Disney Theatrical Productions. While the opportunity was instrumental in my professional development, I always planned to return to the creative side. After three years, I left Disney to build a freelance directing career.
Over the past year-and-a-half, I have directed and assisted on plays in New York, Florida, Seattle, and Minnesota. Whether I'm staging a scene in a musical or taking notes during a play, the one thing that never changes is the way I think about theatre. I am a liberal arts junkie. How I approach and discuss the art is fundamentally influenced by the classes I took through Muhlenberg's Theatre & Dance Department.
With each project, I start with one basic question: Why is telling this particular story important right now? Sometimes the answer is immediately apparent, other times I have to dig deep for an answer. But that question is always my access point. The way I approach a script is by asking questions of the actors, the playwright, and of course myself. I create theatre because I believe it is a meaningful way of illuminating what's culturally, politically, and historically important. Muhlenberg introduced me to this larger way of thinking.

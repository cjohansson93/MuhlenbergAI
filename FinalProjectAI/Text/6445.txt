Softball Splits Two on Opening Day
 Sunday, March 4, 2012 - page 2







					 





Kline's home run was the fourth of her career.




The Muhlenberg softball team opened up its 2012 campaign by splitting a pair of games in Clermont, Fla., against teams who, like the Mules, won 25 games last year. Muhlenberg beat Simmons, 7-1, before losing to Cornell (Iowa), 8-5.

Junior Angie Sisco pitched a complete-game six-hitter in the opener. She gave up doubles to two of the first three batters she faced but settled down nicely, allowing only four hits the rest of the way and finishing the game off with her third strikeout.

Sisco was helped out by her defense in the top of the fifth when junior Devon Barber threw out a runner attempting to score from second on a single to center.

Barber contributed on offense too, going 3-for-3. She led off the game with a single and scored on a triple by sophomore Erica Wenzel. In the fifth, after her outfield assist, Barber hit a two-run double and came around to score on a two-run homer by sophomore Kelly Kline. 

Sophomore Chelsea Benjamin also had an RBI double, and junior Jessica Costa was 2-for-3 with a run scored. Every Mule starter had at least one hit.

In the second game, Muhlenberg led 5-4 before Cornell scored four runs in the bottom of the sixth. Benjamin drove in another run with a single, and junior Elizabeth
Sullivan broke a 4-4 tie with an RBI triple in the fifth.

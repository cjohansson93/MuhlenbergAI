The winners of The Edwin A. Miller Writing Awards and The Muhlenberg Weekly Journalism Awards were honored at a virtual presentation on June 24, 2021. The Edwin A. Miller Awards, named after the late founder of the POB Publishing Company, allows students to submit work under the following categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry and Drama. Similarly, the inaugural Muhlenberg Weekly Journalism Awards highlights the work of the Collegeâs student journalists. Categories for submission included News, Pandemic News and BergBeat Feature Stories. All winners received monetary prizes and were given feedback from professional writers. 
"I am thrilled to be able to honor our talented student writers through the Edwin W. Miller Writing Awards,â says Linda Miller, associate professor of English and director of the Creative Writing program. âI am so pleased that a generous gift has made this yearly contest a possibility."

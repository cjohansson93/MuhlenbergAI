Men's Lacrosse Comes Back vs. Nationally Ranked Stevens, Falls in OT
 Wednesday, March 6, 2013 - page 3







					 



Although it didn’t end in a win, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team made a gutsy comeback against one of the top teams in Division III.

Trailing 8-0 at halftime and 10-4 after three quarters at sixth-ranked Stevens, the Mules rallied to score six goals in the fourth quarter to force overtime.

Muhlenberg had a possession early in overtime and took a shot that would have won the game, but it was saved. The Ducks came down and scored on their ensuing possession, 1:21 into the extra period, for an 11-10 win.

Remarkably, the Mules (2-3) scored three times in the last minute of regulation. Sophomore Jon Thomas made the score 10-8 with 57 seconds left, and senior Doug Rheiner brought the Mules within one with his third goal of the game at the 19-second mark.

Senior Ian Jones won the ensuing faceoff, his fifth win of the quarter. Rheiner’s shot sailed high with three seconds left, but Muhlenberg retained possession. Senior Kyle Houston fed sophomore Jason Mertz, who finished off his first career hat trick as the horn sounded.

The Mules, who have never come back from a halftime deficit of more than three goals to win, were blanked for the first 35 minutes of the game before scoring 10 goals in the final 24:23.

Rheiner contributed to half of the goals, adding two assists to his three goals to tie a career high with five points. 

Sophomore Adam Schlauch made a career-high 15 saves against a Stevens team that averaged nearly 17 goals in winning its first four games. Senior longstick James Coleman (right) was part of the defensive effort and also contributed to the offense, scoring his third career goal late in the third quarter.

 The Shifting Aesthetics of Online Video: A Commercial History of YouTubeâs Annual Top 10 Lists (2005-2012)
 
Since Google purchased YouTube in 2006, studies on the commercialization of the site and its content have increased substantially. This paper considers the impact of YouTubeâs commercialization in a light previously overlooked by scholarship: online video aesthetics. Through qualitative analyses of the siteâs annual Top 10 Videos lists, this paper charts aesthetic changes in YouTubeâs most popular content over the course of the siteâs history. More specifically, the analyses examine the economic implications of increased commercial aesthetics among YouTubeâs Top Videos lists. From 2005 to 2012, a shift from low budget to bigger-budget content emerged among the siteâs most popular videos. This paper argues that the presence of progressively expensive aesthetics on the siteâs Top Videos lists (from 2005-2012) discriminates against low-budget narrative video making.

Bauer Wins Third Gold Medal, Rosenthal Second Silver at CC Track Meet
 Sunday, May 4, 2014 - page 2







					 



Jordan Rosenthal will probably have to wait another year for a shot at a Centennial Conference gold medal in the javelin. If its throwers keep performing like this, the Muhlenberg track and field teams are probably just fine with that.


Junior Tyler Bauer and Rosenthal, a sophomore, finished 1-2 in the javelin on the final day of competition at the CC Championships for the second straight year, becoming the first pair of Mule men to win gold and silver in back-to-back years. It was the third straight gold for Bauer, who outdistanced his counterpart by a little more than six feet. A year ago, Bauer broke the previous meet record by 10 feet and bested Rosenthal by more than 24 feet.

In just his second time competing this season, Rosenthal (left) set a new personal best with a throw of 195-11, good for fifth all-time at Muhlenberg, which also saw senior Andy Wolfe place fifth in the event with a career-best toss.

The javelin trio combined for nearly a third of the men’s team’s 66.5 points, which was good for a second straight fifth-place finish. The men landed in the top five for the 13th time in 14 seasons, while the women accumulated 65 points and wound up in sixth.

Bauer was one of two Mules to win gold over the weekend, joining sophomore Daniel Cano, who became the first discus champion in program history on Saturday. Cano just missed a medal in the shot put with a fourth-place finish, three spots better than last year’s showing.


The Muhlenberg women combined for two medals and five ECAC-qualifying performances over the course of the three-day event. In addition to freshman Claudia Theriault, who won a silver medal in the pole vault on Friday, senior Stephanie Carnevale earned a bronze medal in the 100-meter hurdles.

Carnevale’s clocking in the hurdles was an ECAC qualifier, and gave the veteran nine career medals at the conference championships; she also won a pair of bronzes indoors this year. Carnevale placed fourth in the 100-meter dash.

Seniors  Lauren Zakheim and Nicki Cronin also posted ECAC-qualifying times. Zakheim (right) came in fourth in the 800 meters for her first individual place at the CC meet, while Cronin finished fifth in the 1,500 with the fourth-best clocking in program history. Zakheim’s time in qualifying was good for fifth on the all-time performance list.

Zakheim and Cronin were also part of the ECAC-qualifying 4x400-meter relay team, joining Carnevale and sophomore Claire Thornton, who was seventh in the 800.

Sophomore Melanie Tramontina was eighth in the 5,000 meters for her first place at the outdoor meet, jumping into seventh on the all-time performance list with an ECAC-qualifying mark. Her time was 28 seconds better than her previous outdoor best. 

Sophomores Ashley Riley and Katrina Faust and freshman Jacqueline Jones joined Carnevale and Cano as Muhlenberg athletes to earn multiple individual places. Riley took sixth in the triple jump on Sunday to go along with her fifth-place finish in the long jump a day earlier, while Faust and Jones tied for sixth in the high jump a day after finishing 5-6 in the pole vault. Faust also placed fifth in the 100-meter hurdles.

For the men, seniors Jarrett Felix and Bobby McGetrick teamed with juniors Kieran Newcomb and Josh Elkan to post an ECAC-qualifying time in the 4x800-meter relay.

Junior Cody Geyer was a fifth-place finisher in the 100-meter dash, while sophomore James Knight was sixth in the 110-meter hurdles. 

Sophomore Brandon Tauber (fifth) and freshman  Trevor Luck (seventh) both placed in the high jump.

Anonymous (American, 19th C) Portrait of John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, circa 1800-1900 Oil on canvas
 This beautiful portrait depicts John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg who lived from 1746 to 1807.  His illustrious career included serving as a major general under George Washington in the Revolutionary War and holding the position of United States Senator and Congressmen from Pennsylvania. He was ordained as a Lutheran Minister in 1768. Shown dressed in traditional military garb, the Portrait of John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg demonstrates the ability of American portrait painters to realistically capture and convey the vision of such an important historical figure with certainty.

muhlenberg claims matte award again














The Matte Award, like most sporting events, is usually a back-and-forth affair. But for the second straight school year Muhlenberg won the trophy in wire-to-wire fashion, claiming a 5-0 victory in mens soccer in the first contest of the year and never looking back.




Seniors Nicki Notarianni of the field hockey team and Alyssa Bascelli of the womens lacrosse team pose with the Matte trophy after representing Muhlenbergs student-athletes at the annual luncheon.





The Mules built an insurmountable 10-2 lead and went on to win the annual all-sports competition with Moravian, 11½-6½, clinching ownership of the trophy for the seventh straight year with a 20-5 victory in womens lacrosse.

Muhlenberg formally claimed the trophy at a luncheon attended by administrators, coaches and student-athletes from both schools.

One of the great things about this rivalry is that we dont have any of the problems that other rivalries have with unsportsmanlike conduct, said Muhlenberg athletic director Sam Beidleman. Everyone shakes hands and goes on their way.

Its a pleasure to have known Aaron Matte and been a part of this rivalry, he added. It is something that has been going on for a long time and is very special. And its our pleasure to take this trophy home with us once again.

Strategic Plan 2017 - 2022
The 2017 â 2022 Strategic Plan: Muhlenberg Opens Doors is available through your campus login on this site. After you login, click on the + sign after Attention From the Office of the President and access the Plan.
In 2014, the Board of Trustees adopted Muhlenberg's Diversity Strategic Plan. Muhlenberg's Previous Strategic Plan - 'Momentum,' was approved by the College's Board of Trustees in 2010 and completed in 2015.
In 2016 the Middle States accredation released their team report. This included the self-study executive summary.
Additional strategic plan documents, including Emerging Themes in the strategic plan process, a comprehensive Meta SWOT analysis and a Community Planning Event Recap are available to members of our community. The information is identical for both students and faculty/staff.

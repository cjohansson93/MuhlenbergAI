Women's Soccer Ties in Shootout; Women's Tennis Falls
 Wednesday, October 1, 2014 - page 3







					 





This was hardly your typical Muhlenberg women’s soccer game.

The Mules, who had a recent stretch of 17 games that ended in a shutout one way or the other, found themselves in a rare shootout against local rival DeSales, finishing in a 3-3 tie.


Muhlenberg (6-2-2) hadn’t played a game in which both teams scored two goals since a 2011 contest against Moravian. The last time each team scored three goals? In 2010, also against Moravian.

For the first time since 2008, the Mules came from behind twice in the same game. And it was a couple of seniors who spearheaded the comeback with long overdue goals.

Muhlenberg was behind 2-0 late in the first half when senior Audrey Zamichow (left) collected a loose ball in front of the keeper and popped it into the net for her first goal in three years.

Early in the second half, senior Leah Messler took a cross from junior Taylor Pini and converted for her first goal since freshman year.

The goal celebration (right) was heartfelt for Messler, who missed all of last season with an injury, but the good feeling didn’t last long. Just 49 seconds later, the Bulldogs (3-5-3) scored on a header to reclaim the lead.

With under 19 minutes to play, Pini ran into a failed clear and shot in her third goal of the season, tying the score again.

Muhlenberg came the closest to untying it when a long shot by freshman Carly DeNigris hit the crossbar late in the second half. Both teams took shots in the back-and-forth overtime periods, but the game ended in a draw.

Junior Jen Mermelstein, playing for the first time since the first week of the season, played the final 49 minutes in goal and made three saves without allowing a goal.

The Muhlenberg wrestling team began the new year by crowning a champion, as senior Ian Gimbar won the 197-pound 
title at the Long Island Open, hosted by Nassau Community College.

In just his second day of collegiate competition, Gimbar went 3-0, winning his first two bouts on pins – one in just 34 seconds – before
scoring a 10-5 decision against a Division II opponent from LIU Post.

Sophomore Jaryd Flank rebounded from a loss in his first bout to finish third at 125, recording two
pins and a major decision in his three consolation bracket contests. Flank (right) is 5-2 this season
with a major decision, two technical falls and two pins accounting for his five wins.

Junior Jim Coiley split four bouts at 174, recording his first pin of the season against a wrestler
from Centennial Conference rival Merchant Marine. Junior Lenny Smith notched his first career win
with a first-round pin at heavyweight, and junior Che Chengsupanimit won a bout at 149.

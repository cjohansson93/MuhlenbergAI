two seniors earn all-ccvolleyball honors



After leading the Muhlenberg volleyball team back to the Centennial Conference playoffs for the first time in eight years, two seniors were named to the All-Conference team.

Christina Cangelosi was selected as the libero on the first team. She leads the CC with her school-record average of 5.87 digs per set. Through matches of November 1,
she ranked 22nd in Division III in digs per set. Cangelosi’s 522 digs in 2009 were the second-most in team history and enabled her to become the program’s all-time
digs leader with 1,434. Muhlenberg’s first first-team selection since 2005, Cangelosi played in every set except one in her four years with the Mules and finished third on the all-time list in digs per set (3.72).

Hitter Phylicia Lee earned CC recognition for the second year in a row, receiving honorable mention. She led Muhlenberg in kills (240) and service aces (34) and
ranked second in digs (304) and third in blocks (33). Lee finished her career in the top 15 on the program’s all-time lists in kills (ninth with 729), digs (11th with 987)
and aces (eighth with 125).

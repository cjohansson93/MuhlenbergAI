ODonnell's big hit helps softball earn St. Pattys Day split





Barber went 3-for-7 with three runs scored and two steals against Drew. She leads the Mules with eight stolen bases this season.



For the second game in a row, the Muhlenberg softball team was able to regroup after a tough loss in the first game by exploding on offense in game two to earn a split at Drew.

The Mules scored seven runs in the first inning of the second game, just as they did against Elizabethtown on Tuesday. They then added 10 more in the fourth for a 17-4 win.

Muhlenberg (7-4) scored its first four runs on a pair of bases-loaded walks, a sacrifice fly and an RBI single by freshman Chelsea Benjamin.

Then freshman Colleen ODonnell celebrated St. Patricks Day by delivering the crushing blow, a two-RBI double to left. Then she displayed a little luck of the Irish as she stole home to cap the seven-run inning.

After learning on Tuesday that no lead is safe, the Mules kept on scoring in the fourth.

Senior Jess Kasza reached on a bases-loaded error that scored a pair of runs. 

Junior Brittany Blohm and sophomore Devon Barber added a pair of RBI singles before the Mules scored two more runs on bases-loaded walks.

Freshman Kelly Kline cleared the bases with a triple to right center, before scoring on a passed ball to give the Mules a commanding 16-run lead that put the Rangers (7-4) away.

The 17 runs are Muhlenbergs most since the 2005 season opener. Its also the first time the Mules have registered two 10-run innings in the same season in more than 13 years.  

In game one, sophomore Angie Sisco allowed only one hit through the first five innings before the Rangers finally got to her for three runs in the sixth for a 3-1 win.

Baseball to Face Haverford


Johns Hopkins broke a 1-1 tie with four runs in fourth inning and went on to defeat Muhlenberg, 9-1, in the first round of the Centennial Conference baseball tournament.

The Mules (20-19) face Haverford,  6-0 loser to Franklin & Marshall in an elimination game on Saturday at 12:30. Hopkins and F&M will meet at 9:00, with the winner advancing to Sunday’s championship game. The winner of the Muhlenberg-Haverford game will face the loser of Johns Hopkins and F&M in another elimination contest.

Muhlenberg took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first when junior Eric Hammond led off the game with a single, went to second on a single by sophomore Eric Pomroy and scored on a third single, by junior Edward Risener.

After recording three hits with their first four batters, however, the Mules slowed down on offense, managing just three hits the rest of the game. Pomroy finished with three of Muhlenberg’s six hits, including a double.

 A fielding error and a misplayed bunt opened the door for the Blue Jays’ four-run fourth.

conceded a 13-3 loss against No. 1 Gettysburg in the first semifinal of the 
Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Bullets, who have won the tournament in the last four seasons and currently rank third in the nation, advance to the final game against Washington on Sunday.

After a scoreless first five minutes, Gettysburg scored at the 9:25 and 8:03 marks to take a 2-0 lead. Penalties then came into play, as the Bullets netted a goal with each team down a man, followed by three man-up goals, to extend their margin to a commanding 6-0 early in the second quarter.

The goals for the Mules were scored by seniors Kyle Farris and Mickey Norton and junior Nick Fletcher. Norton and Farris finished their careers as Muhlenberg’s leading scorers with 123 and 120 points, respectively. 

With the loss, the Mules conclude the best campaign ever in school history, which saw the team set a record for most wins in a season (10), most victories in the league (five) and longest winning streak (eight).

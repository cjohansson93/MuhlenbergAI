General Information

Muhlenberg College is a competitive institution of higher education committed to ensuring that all qualified students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services to ensure full access to programs, services and activities. Students with disabilities who are the most successful at the post secondary level are those who are appropriately qualified and prepared for independent academic study have full knowledge of the impact of their disability, and who demonstrate well-developed self-advocacy skills. Students with disabilities should also be well-informed about the changes in the laws that govern their rights and responsibilities as a college student, as well as, the laws that govern the post secondary institutionâs responsibilities to students with disabilities who are in attendance.
Students entering college should be aware that the criteria for disability determination and eligibility for accommodations, auxiliary aids and services at post-secondary institutions differs from those used for eligibility determination in the K-12 experience. At the post-secondary level, the determination of disability is made in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended in 2008; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the standards of the individual College. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), defines a disability as âa physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or having a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairmentâ.
Students with diagnosed conditions that rise to the level of a disability, who will be requesting accommodations and services at Muhlenberg College, must complete the Disability Determination Process prior to the development of an Accommodation Plan. This multi-faceted process and approval includes the studentâs self-disclosure and personal interview, the timely submission of detailed documentation of the disorder/condition, and an interpretation of the evaluation data. Disability-related documentation submitted to obtain accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services at the post-secondary level must identify the disability, review a history of academic and/or non-academic experiences related to the diagnosed condition, provide evidence of the impact of thediagnosed condition on the major life activities, and provide information about previous accommodations and services used by the student related to the condition.

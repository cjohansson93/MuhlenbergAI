Muhlenberg College has announced that Allan Chen has been named Chief Information Officer.  He is currently the Chief Information Officer at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif. 
From 2007-2012, Chen served as the Assistant Dean of Law Technology and Academic Computing at Santa Clara University School of Law.  Chen began his career at Stanford University, where he held various positions in both academic computing and student computing from 2000-2007.  Chen's duties at Muhlenberg will begin on August 1.
"Allan has a proven track record as a technology leader at educational institutions in Silicon Valley," said Muhlenberg College President-elect John I. Williams, Jr., who chaired the search committee.  "At Muhlenberg, he will play an essential role in shaping the strategic vision for how technology can support Muhlenberg's creative culture to connect students, faculty, staff, alumni and parents to learning, service and career opportunities throughout the world.  I am delighted Allan is joining our leadership team at this exciting time in the history of the College."
As Muhlenberg's first-ever CIO, Chen will report directly to the president. In this role, Chen will lead the College’s efforts to streamline and advance the academic, social and creative experience and impact of Muhlenberg’s community both on and off campus.  Chen will be charged with planning, directing and managing Muhlenberg’s information and technology resources, including: academic and administrative computing, user training and support, instructional design services, media services, network and data security, video and telephone services in support of teaching, learning, communicating and managing. 
“I’m truly impressed with Muhlenberg’s creative, collaborative culture—and the potential to leverage my experience to help students, faculty, and alumni to make an even greater impact on our world by setting a new standard for a technology-enabled campus,” said Chen.
Chen received a B.A. from Stanford University and an M.B.A. from Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City.  With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education and public health. A member of the Centennial Conference, Muhlenberg competes in 22 varsity sports.  Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

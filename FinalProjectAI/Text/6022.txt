Two Milestones and a Comeback, But No Win for Field Hockey
 Friday, October 21, 2011







					 



Two players reached milestones, and the Muhlenberg field hockey team came back from a 2-0 deficit to tie, but Gettysburg put in a disputed late goal to pull out
a 3-2 win.

Kayleigh Thies scored both Mule goals, becoming just the fifth freshman in team history (and the first in 20 years) to reach double figures, and senior Brittany
DeAngelis broke the school record for defensive saves in a season.

The Bullets (7-7, 5-3) scored the first goal off a penalty corner 15:26 into the game and added a second one eight minutes later. The damage could have been worse
if not for three defensive saves, one by senior Renee Norton and two by DeAngelis. The two stops by DeAngelis gave her 11 for the season, breaking
the old mark of 10 set by Kate Moyer in 2006.

DeAngelis, who was already the program’s career leader, added a third defensive save later. She entered the week ranked third in Division III in defensive saves.

Muhlenberg scored a big goal late in the half when Thies dribbled in solo from the top and beat the Gettysburg goalie from 10 yards out to make it a 2-1 game.

The Bullets threatened to extend their lead with about 23 minutes left in the second half, but junior Kristen Dornenburg came far out of the net
to stop a breakaway, then made a diving save off a penalty corner moments later.

Despite being a player down due to a yellow card, the Mules (4-11, 2-7) kept on the attack and finally tied the score when Thies blasted in a shot off 
the last of three straight penalty corners
with 7:09 to play. It was her 10th goal of the season, putting her in exclusive company. In the 53 years of Muhlenberg field hockey, the only other freshmen to net
at least 10 goals were Linda Meiser (12 in 1986), Sue McClatchy (12 in 1969), Melissa Mills (11 in 1991) and Lynn Vogt (10 in 1964).

Just 47 seconds after the tying goal, however, Gettysburg broke the tie with a goal that was protested by the Mules. The referees allowed it, and the Bullets held
on for the win.

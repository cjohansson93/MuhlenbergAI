softball sweeps first home games



Baseball Ties TCNJ


The Muhlenberg baseball team nearly pulled off a win against a nationally renowned program, but The College of New Jersey scored single runs in the eighth and ninth for a 3-3 tie. The game was called after nine innings due to darkness.

The Lions (5-6-1) were ranked No. 1 in Division III as recently as 2006 and were ranked in the top 10 most of last year. 

Sophomore Kevin Witmier pitched a gem, allowing only one run on four hits through seven innings. The Mules (5-9-1) were one out away from victory when TCNJ used a walk, stolen base and single to knot the score.

Senior Christian Conti recorded his 100th career hit when he singled in the first inning. Hit No. 101 was even better, a solo home run leading off the fourth to tie the game at 1-1. Conti also made a terrific catch in right field with two runners on base to end the fifth inning.

Junior Eric Pomroy gave Muhlenberg a 3-1 lead with a bases-loaded single in the fifth.

Nearly two weeks after wrapping up its Spring Break trip to Florida with a pair of wins, the Muhlenberg softball team resumed its winning ways by sweeping Hunter in its first home doubleheader of the season.

Sophomores Ashley Brewer and Alyssa Bruckner combined to hold the Hawks (1-9) to nine hits in the 3-0, 4-0 sweep, which brought the Mules back to the .500 mark with a 5-5 record. It was the first time the Mules did not allow a run in a

doubleheader since 2006 against Washington, and the first time in a non-conference twinbill since 1991 against Allentown.

Muhlenberg’s four-game winning streak is its longest since a seven-game run in 2006.

Brewer allowed four hits and struck out six in the opener in pitching her second straight shutout. Although Hunter put a runner on base in every inning but the seventh, none made it past second base.

Brewer drove in the only run she would need with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the first. The Mules added insurance runs in the fifth on a wild pitch and in the sixth on a double by freshman Brittany Blohm.

Bruckner’s five-hitter was her second career shutout. She did not allow a runner past second until the last inning and started two double plays, one on a ground ball and one on a line drive.

After scoring an unearned run on a groundout in the second, Muhlenberg added three in an ugly third inning that featured four Hunter errors.

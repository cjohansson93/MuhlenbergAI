Vowell has made appearances on The Daily Show with John Stewart, The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O’Brien and is the voice of teen Superhero Violet Parr in Bard Bird’s Academy Award-winning film, The Incredibles. Vowell has written a number of non-fiction books on American history and culture. Her books include Assassination Vacation and The Wordy Shipmates. A number of written works by Ms. Vowell has also been used for the Chicago-based radio program This American Life.  Vowell’s appearance is a part of Living Writers, a semester-long series of public readings. Future readings will be given by Art Spiegelman and Alan Michael Parker. Established in 1994, “Living Writers” is a course offered once every three years which brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening. Each writer is interviewed on the college’s radio station. Their visit is a community event. Past participants have included David Sedaris, Jonathan Franzen, Gary Snyder, Adrienne Rich, Francine Prose, Galway Kinnell, Robert Pinsky, Michael Ondaatje and Phillip Levine.

Campus Community Message from President Harring
Friday, April 3, 2020

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
It may come as no surprise that crisis can lead to fear, which can fuel hate and blame seeking. Unfortunately, amid the pandemic, our nation is seeing a spike in racist and xenophobic behavior, some which has led to violence, towards Asian and Asian American community members. 
I want to reiterate, racist and xenophobic behavior has no place at Muhlenberg College. Should the College receive a report of a bias incident or hate crime, we will pursue it to the fullest extent possible, and work with law enforcement where necessary. 
There are a variety of informational and educational resources on standing up against current racist and xenophobic conduct, and I would like to share just a few of those here with you:


Speaking Up Against Racism Around the New Coronavirus


How to Respond to Coronavirus Racism


Standing up Against Racism During a Pandemic as an Antiracist White Woman


Please remember that we have resources available on campus, working remotely: 


If you want to report an incident, please contact Christine Wechsler, Interim Director of Equity and Title IX, and/or Campus Safety. If the incident did not occur on campus or by another campus community member, these departments can give you guidance on working with resources local to you. 


Members of the Bias Resource Education Team (BRET) and the Office of Multicultural Life can meet individually with any faculty, staff or students to offer support. 


Finally, as always, our College Counseling Center is open to all students for confidential support. Students can schedule virtual appointments here.


Muhlenbergâs strength is its community. In these uncertain times where we are physically separated, it is as important as ever for us to come together and to continue to support one another. 
Stay well,Kathleen E. HarringInterim President

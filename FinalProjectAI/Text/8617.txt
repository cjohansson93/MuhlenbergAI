Professor of History Ettinger 300C 484-664-3327
Education: A. B., History Temple University 1972  Ph.D., History Temple University 1980 Teaching Fields: 20th-century U. S. Economic/Political/Diplomatic History My teaching and research interests are the political and economic history of the United States.  In all my courses I view history as a means to promote analytical thinking and writing.   My courses emphasize close reading of primary source materials, historiansâ conflicting interpretations, and frequent writing assignments that encourage students to develop their own interpretations of the past.
My current research project explores the often difficult political partnership of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon.

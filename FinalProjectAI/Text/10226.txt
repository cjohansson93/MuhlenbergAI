Director of Instructional Technology & Media Services Tom Sciarrino assembles 3D-printed masks for local healthcare workers.
Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) recently put out a call for help asking local colleges and universities to 3D print plastic face shield headbands for hospital workers treating COVID-19 patients. Rita Chesterton, director of the College's innovation & entrepreneurship program, began organizing a Muhlenberg team to respond, starting with the 3D printer that is normally housed in the campusâs makerspace.
âLVHN has a crew of staff members and volunteers that are creating the face shield part,â explained Tom Sciarrino, director of instructional technology & media services. âBut I donât think they have the capacity or experience to use 3D printers for a need of this scale.â
Sciarrinoâs department purchased a 3D printer about three years ago, and its uses have ranged from a history class project on monuments to a particle detector for Professor of Physics Brett Fademâs classes. Fademâs project was such a success that the physics department purchased their own printer, which he is now using at home to print the bands.

âOur printer takes about an hour and a half to complete each face shield,â said Fadem. He is making the bottom portion of the mask. âI'll be making 11 of them today,â he says.
Sciarrino's 3D printer is taking a different approach. âIâm trying to maximize the space because the machine doesnât have the biggest build plate, but itâs taking about two hours per headband,â he says. Sciarrino estimates that he can churn out 25 bands a week with one $25 roll of the plastic making a couple hundred bands.
âI can print one band in about two and a half hours on my machine,â Chesterton says. âYou just hit print and walk away, checking on occasion to make sure there are no problemsâ3D printing can be a little finicky. I am working on stacking the print so I can print five at a time so it can print while I sleep.â Chesterton has a roll of plastic on hand with another roll on order. âThere doesn't appear to be a shortage, which is good,â she says.
Once the masks are complete, there is a drop-off location on Allentown's nearby Lehigh Street where LVHN can pick them up, sanitize them and assemble them with the shields.
âIf thereâs any way we can use the tools that we have that would just be sitting in our office at this time, itâs our obligation to help out,â says Sciarrino. âWe want to do anything we can to help those in harm's way.â
Muhlenberg College students, faculty, staff and alumni are working to support their communities during the global COVID-19 crisis.

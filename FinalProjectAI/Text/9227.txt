April 26-28, 2018
by Ntozake ShangeDirected by Sharrell D. Luckett, Ph.D. Choreography by Randall Anthony SmithGuest Musician: Rahbi Hines
Ntozake Shange's critically acclaimed choreopoem combines music, poetry, and improvisational dance into a story of strength, resiliency, and celebration. Performed entirely by women, the play offers a narrative of self-discovery, coming-of-age stories, self-love, and familial bond between Black women who share both joyous and painful experiences. Providing moving insights into the beautiful and layered complexities of Black girlhood and womanhood, Shange's unique storytelling style centers the lived experiences of Black women while honoring their diverse ways of loving and living in their truth.

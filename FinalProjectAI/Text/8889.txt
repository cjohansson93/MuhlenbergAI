Include the individual in the conversation:
Include the individual in the conversation: We encourage faculty, staff, students, and parents to address their concerns with the student prior to submitting a CARE referral, although we are aware this is not always possible. Speaking openly with the student about your concern and your decision to submit a CARE referral lets the student know that you care about their success and that there are resources available that can help.

LANTA Regional Bus Service
Debuted in January 2019, Muhlenberg provides access for all of its students and employees to ride any LANTA bus, swipe their College ID card and travel throughout Lehigh and Northampton counties, seven days a week.
The program includes two Chew Street bus stops on Muhlenbergâs campus: westbound in front of the walkway near The School of Continuing Studies and eastbound in front of the Baker Center for the Arts.
The Muhlenberg/Chew Street bus stops include easy access to:


Route 213, which includes stops in downtown Allentown, Trexler Park and New Vision Tilghman Square 8 Theater (Route map)
Route 322, which includes stops in downtown Allentown, Hamilton Crossings, Trexler Mall and Movie Tavern. (Route map)


An existing LANTA bus stop at 22nd and Chew Streets provides access to Route 218, which includes stops in downtown Allentown and the Village West Shopping Center (Route map).
LANTA offers four convenient ways to use the myStop bus tracker to find the real-time status of a bus, including iPhone and Android apps. With their College ID cards, Muhlenberg students and employees can also transfer buses at no charge throughout the Lehigh Valley.
The free LANTA bus service is replacing Muhlenbergâs Cardinal Shuttle service, which was previously operated by College staff. The Grey Shuttle service will continue during the Spring 2019 semester.
Muhlenberg College also maintains a partnership with the Allentown Parking Authority to offer a Zagster Bike Share program for both campus and community members.

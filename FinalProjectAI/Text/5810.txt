Women’s tennis duo reaches semis


The Muhlenberg doubles team of freshmen Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt advanced to the semifinals of the blue draw at the ITA Southeast Regional.

Winston and Schmidt went 3-1 in the tournament, blanking a Franklin & Marshall duo, 8-0, in the quarterfinal round before losing to a team from host
Mary Washington in the semis.

The Mules had a successful weekend at the ITA tournament. Of the seven singles and three doubles entries, all but one won at least one match. Schmidt was still alive
in the consolation bracket of the singles gray draw when she withdrew due to injury.

Student research and scholarship is a fundamental component of the Muhlenberg liberal arts experience. Every year students from across the curriculum present their research and scholarship in this interdisciplinary poster fair.  During Alumni weekend, members of the Muhlenberg community come to share in this celebration of student-faculty collaboration.

Dr. Michael Carbone is the Issac Miles Wright Professor and chair of the Education Department. He earned his doctorate in the Historical and Sociological Foundations of Education from Ball State University and began teaching at Muhlenberg College in 1984. Since coming to Muhlenberg, he has taught courses in the Foundations of Education, History and Politics of American Education, Secondary Teaching Methodologies and Technologies, and Studies in Professional Education.
He has also taught in the First-Year Seminar Program and the Dana Scholars Program. In collaboration with his colleague Kathleen Milligan, he was instrumental in creating and funding the Departmentâs Professional Development School Project, a notable achievement for a small education department in a liberal arts college.
He received the Lindback Award for Teaching in 1994 and held the Donald and Ann Shire Distinguished Teaching Professorship for academic year 1996-1998. As well, he received the Paul C. Empie Teaching award in May 1991. His intellectual interests include the politics of education, policy studies, historical studies, critical multicultural studies, and schools as places of work.
Recently, he and Professor Richwine (Education) presented their qualitative study on the effects of NCLB on teacher work.

like, pask named to scholar-athlete teams



Senior guard Abra Like and senior forward Greg Pask were named to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Scholar-Athlete Teams for their academic accomplishments at Muhlenberg. The honorees were announced at a luncheon today.
 
Pask is currently in his senior year as a 


biochemistry major. His unique leadership qualities have earned him the privilege to be team captain in his last season with the Mules.
  
“We are very fortunate to have Greg on the team,” said Muhlenberg head coach Dave Madeira. “He came to our school because he wanted to get good education and play basketball. Greg is a hard worker and a team leader. He is well respected not only by his teammates and classmates, but also by people in the community.”

Last year, the Cape May, N.J., native was selected to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll. Pask has played 66 games, averaging 2.8 points and 1.9 rebounds per game, during his Muhlenberg career.

Like, who majors in biology with a minor in Spanish, wants to be a physician assistant when she graduates. 

“Abra is an outstanding student-athlete,” said Muhlenberg head coach Ron Rohn. “She is involved in various campus activities. Abra has a great character and is always willing to help her teammates.”

Like has played 12 games this season, including five starts at point guard. The Frederick, Md., native ranks third on the team in steals (16) and fourth in assists (25). 

During the 2006-07 campaign, she enjoyed her most successful season in a Muhlenberg uniform as she started 23 games, during which she averaged 6.0 points, 2.6 rebounds, 1.3 steals and a team-leading 4.4 assists. Like compiled a total of 102 assists, becoming only the fourth Muhlenberg player to surpass the century mark in assists in a season.

Volleyball Ties School Record with 11th Straight Win

In its first match after receiving votes in the Division III poll for the first time in program history, the Muhlenberg 
volleyball team looked the part, sweeping past Bryn Mawr in three sets.

The win was the 11th straight for the Mules (18-2, 5-0), tying the school record set in 1993. The team also is off to its
best Centennial Conference start ever and remained in a three-way tie for first with Swarthmore and Haverford, who also won.

The Mules hit at a very high percentage (.366) for the second straight match and needed little more than an hour to finish
off the sweep. The Owls (9-10, 0-4) scored the first point of the first set and the second set but did not lead at any other
time.

Sophomore Allison Glass led all players with 13 kills, while juniors Erin Murphy and 
Katherine Boll each recorded eight kills in fewer than 15 attempts. Junior Sarah Weyhmuller (right)
had six kills in only eight swings.

Boll added five aces, with three coming in a span of four serves early in the second set.

Senior Nikki Dickson and junior Vanessa Pulice registered 16 and 13 assists, respectively,
while junior Chelsea Kaser led the defense with nine digs.

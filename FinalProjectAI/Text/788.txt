Is Weight Loss Camp A âSafe-Havenâ for OverweightChildren?
Conflicting messages are conveyed to children concerning weight loss,how they should look and what they should be buying or eating. Todayit is very hard for them to discern what is healthy and what is normal,especially for overweight children. One message that they are given is
to look like the models that are portrayed in the media. The other message the media puts out is that unhealthy foods should be consumed at a high rate. They do this by making them child-friendly. To attain the projected ideals in the media and to cope with them, overweight children often choose to pursue a summer weight-loss camp. In this study, I interviewed a few subjects that attended one of these camps. I questioned how much of a âsafe havenâ camps were, in terms of helping children to escape the mediated atmosphere they normally live in, andhow good it was for them in terms of attaining their goals. The study argues that the camps are âsafe havensâ because they provide over weight children a place to achieve their goals and feel more secure. The camp, however, is not a total âsafe havenâ because the very definition of the camperâs goals and what they strive for is derived from the mediated messages and societyâs standards.

Men’s Basketball


Ursinus, the hottest team in the Centennial Conference, used a flurry of three-pointers to send Muhlenberg to an 81-60 defeat.

The Bears (16-2, 11-0) led by only seven at halftime but made four of their first five three-point attempts in the second half to widen their lead.

The Mules (8-10, 6-5) were led by a trio of sophomores. Obi Nwizugbo scored 15 points, Ryan Foster added 11, and Peter Barnes recorded 
his first career double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds.

Wrestling


An injury-depleted Mule squad fell to five-time defending Centennial Conference champion Ursinus, 47-6.

Muhlenberg (2-7, 1-4) had to forfeit five weight classes and was missing starters at three others. Senior Joe Tartar gave the Mules their only points with his 10th
pin of the season at heavyweight.

As the point guard for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team, freshman Kelly McKeon usually runs the offense. But for a key stretch of the Mules’ game at defending Centennial Conference champion Ursinus, she was the offense.

McKeon made four consecutive three-pointers in the second half to propel Muhlenberg to 



Junior Kaitlin Strumph had a career-high seven assists and helped hold the Bears’ All-CC guard to nine points.


an impressive 61-49 win. The victory put the Mules (14-5, 9-3) into second place in the CC, a half-game behind Dickinson.

Muhlenberg led the whole game, and by a comfortable margin most of the way, but got stuck on 40 points after taking its biggest lead of the game, 40-24, on a jumper by junior Erin McSherry 3:21 into the second half.

For the next six minutes, the Mules went dry from the field, and the Bears (10-8, 8-3) scored seven straight points to cut the gap to single digits. That’s when McKeon started bombing away. Twice, she made three-pointers on back-to-back possessions, giving Muhlenberg a 13-point lead with under six minutes to play and making the prospect of the Mules’ third straight overtime game at Ursinus very unlikely.

McKeon finished with a game-high 18 points, shooting 5-of-7 from three-point range.

The play of junior Lauren Boyle and freshman Sheila Cook led the Mules to a 36-point first half against an Ursinus team that came in allowing only 57.0 points per game. Boyle was 5-for-5 from the field and scored 12 points in the first 20 minutes, while Cook recorded eight points and eight rebounds.

McSherry notched her first career double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds and also held the third-leading scorer in the CC to seven points.

women’s tennis wins at swarthmore



Baseball Comes Up a Run Short


The Muhlenberg baseball team nearly pulled off its third straight last-inning comeback, but came up just short and lost to Haverford, 6-5.

The Mules (9-13-1, 3-2) trailed 6-2 before scoring one run in the eighth. In the bottom of the ninth, Muhlenberg plated one run on a sacrifice fly and another on infield error. The potential tying run reached third base, but the game ended on a groundout.

Sophomore Jeff Puklin went 4-for-5, and senior John Kalis was 3-for-5 with two runs scored.

The game was the third straight with a 6-5 final for the Mules, who have played eight one-run games.

For the first time in its history, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team could 

enjoy its trip back from Swarthmore.

The Mules used their strength at the bottom of the lineup to defeat the Garnet, 6-3. It was their first win against Swarthmore since 2004 and their first win ever at Swarthmore.

The Garnet entered the match ranked eighth in the Atlantic South Region, two spots ahead of the Mules.

Muhlenberg won at second and doubles and at third through sixth singles. Sophomores Sara Sutker (right), Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt all won at both doubles and singles.

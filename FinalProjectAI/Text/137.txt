Fifteen College and community groups participated in Muhlenberg's Earth Day 2018, sharing information about organic farming, climate change action, animal rights, divestiture and a variety of sustainability efforts on campus.
Muhlenberg College has earned a STARS Gold rating in recognition of its sustainability achievements from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). STARS, AASHE's Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, measures and encourages sustainability in all aspects of higher education. Muhlenberg had previously received a STARS Silver designation.

With more than 800 participants in 30 countries, AASHEâs STARS program is the most widely recognized framework in the world for publicly reporting comprehensive information related to a college or universityâs sustainability performance. Participants report achievements in five overall areas: academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation and leadership.
âThe Gold rating is the product of a tremendous amount of work on campus over the last 10 years and weâre very proud of our recognition as one of the leaders in college sustainability,â says Kalyna Procyk, Muhlenbergâs sustainability coordinator and an adjunct professor of sustainability studies. âWe began with a Bronze rating in 2013 and have improved our sustainability efforts over multiple categories each year to reach Gold.â
âWhat has allowed Muhlenberg to progress so successfully in the area of sustainability is the seamless collaboration among students, faculty, operations staff and administrators who are truly committed to furthering a culture of campus sustainability,â says Richard Niesenbaum, professor of biology and director of sustainability studies at Muhlenberg.
âOur sustainability efforts are continually growing,â adds Procyk. âThis spring, for example, our students, faculty and staff will be enjoying a brand-new Muhlenberg bike share program, which is also open to the entire community.â
Unlike other rating or ranking systems, this program is open to all institutions of higher education, and the criteria that determine a STARS rating are transparent and accessible to anyone. Because STARS is a program based on credits earned, it allows for both internal comparisons as well as comparisons with similar institutions.
âSTARS was developed by the campus sustainability community to provide high standards for recognizing campus sustainability efforts,â says AASHE Executive Director Meghan Fay Zahniser. âMuhlenberg College has demonstrated a substantial commitment to sustainability by achieving a STARS Gold rating and is to be congratulated for their efforts.â

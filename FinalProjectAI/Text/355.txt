Muhlenberg College understands that as a student, your financial circumstances can change quickly, at times in ways outside of your control. Financial hardship creates significant stress and can impede student success, health and well-being. As such, the Dean of Students Office works with our CARE Team and coordinates with departments across campus to provide students with a starting point for seeking guidance, assistance and, in certain cases, funding to enable them to flourish at Muhlenberg during challenging times. If you are experiencing an unexpected financial hardship, please explore the resources on this website and do not hesitate to reach out to any of the resources listed to discuss ways the College can assist you.  
In addition, the Collegeâs commitment to low-income or first-generation college students is found first and foremost in our financial aid policies and packages. However, we also recognize that there are needs that are felt in the regular flow of a studentâs life which sometimes fall outside the parameters of the overall financial aid package. Experiential Learning Funds allow students who may not otherwise be able to afford it to participate in meaningful co-curricular and social experiences which may have a cost to participate.

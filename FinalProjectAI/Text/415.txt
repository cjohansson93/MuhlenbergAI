 Edward Hopper     (American, 1882-1967) Night Shadows, 1921 Etching
 A highly respected and popular American painter, Edward Hopper remains a prominent figure in the history of art. Displaying the solitary figure as a favorite and recurring subject, Hopper’s Night Shadows is a characteristic print. Showing the influence of Rembrandt’s etching style, Hopper elongates the shadows of the city where a lone figure moves quietly across the paper. Arguably, Hopper’s best prints of the American Scene were offered in the 1920s and by the 1940s and 1950s, he had established himself as an important American artist.

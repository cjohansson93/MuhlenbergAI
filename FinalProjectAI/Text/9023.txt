Economics and Finance Mission Statement
The mission of the Economics and Finance Programs at Muhlenberg College is to provide a rigorous course of study in the methods and perspectives of economics and finance for the purpose of developing independent and critical thinkers, equipped with ethical values who are able to express ideas with clarity and grace.

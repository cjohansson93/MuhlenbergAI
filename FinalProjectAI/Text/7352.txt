The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team had to love getting l’Åuf out of its Centennial Conference win column.

In their second-to-last match of the season, the Mules earned their first CC win, snapping an 11-match league losing streak with a 6-3 home win against Gettysburg, which also came in winless in the CC.



Plenty of firsts contributed to the win. The doubles teams of junior Daniel Lakhman and sophomore Derrick Eng at No. 2 and senior Ben Berkowitz and freshman David Woods at No. 3, both formed less than a week ago, picked up their first wins together. Lakhman and Eng won 8-4, while Berkowitz and Woods notched an 8-5 win to give Muhlenberg a 2-1 lead after doubles.

The bottom four players in the singles lineup all won, with Berkowitz (No. 3), Woods (No. 5) and Eng (No. 6) picking up their first CC wins of the season in straight sets. Eng had the most convincing match, winning 6-2, 6-0, while Berkowitz (right) 
and Woods each went to a tiebreaker in one set.

Junior Eric Chavis (left) also needed a tiebreaker in his No. 4 singles victory, coming back from a 5-2 deficit in the second set and dominating the tiebreaker, 7-0.

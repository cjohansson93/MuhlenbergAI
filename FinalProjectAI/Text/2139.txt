Employment in the Biology Department
The Biology Department employs students to provide various tasks. You do not necessarily need to be eligible for work-study for some of these positions. Student workers perform routine laboratory and greenhouse maintenance, prepare laboratory reagents, maintain safety records, serve as building Night Supervisors, and assist in introductory laboratories. The Department is always in need of dependable students. Contact Catherine Ingram in the Biology office if you are interested in a job in the Department.

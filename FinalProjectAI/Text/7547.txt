Softball Goes on the Offensive and Wins Two More

While family and friends back home are going batty from the prospect of more snow and frigid temperatures, the Muhlenberg softball team is going batty in sunny Florida.

The Mules scored 23 runs on 27 hits in improving to 4-0 on the season with wins against Elizabethtown (11-0) and St. Mary’s of Minnesota (12-4).  Both games were stopped short of the regulation seven innings by the eight-run rule, something Muhlenberg did only once in its record-setting 31-win campaign last year.



After opening the season with a 2-1 win, the Mules have scored 32 runs in their last three games. Their team batting average through four games is a lofty .409.

Leading the offensive charge are senior Kelly Kline and sophomore Taylor Trifiolis, both batting .643.

Trifiolis drove in three runs in the Elizabethtown game with a two-run double in the first and an RBI single in the second. Kline reached base in all four plate appearances, going 2-for-2 with a double, two walks and two RBI.

Senior Erica Wenzel, who is closing in on the school record for career runs scored, helped her pursuit by crossing home plate four times, becoming the first Mule to do so in nine years.

Muhlenberg led 6-0 after two innings and tacked on five runs in the fourth and fifth to post its most lopsided shutout win since an 11-0 blanking of McDaniel in 2009.

The way Kelsey Jones was pitching, she didn’t need those extra runs. The junior twirled a two-hitter for her seventh career shutout, facing only three batters above the minimum and allowing only one runner past first base (and that on an error).

The Mules fell behind 3-0 in the top of the first in the second game but caught up quickly behind an offense in which every batter in the lineup hit safely, with seven of the nine getting at least two hits.

Kline was 3-for-4 and ended the game with an RBI double in the bottom of the sixth, and sophomore Brittany Dzieciolowski was 3-for-3. Kline, Trifiolis and sophomore Nicole Iannarone (right) each drove in two runs.

Already ahead 6-4, Muhlenberg broke the game open with a five-run fourth, an inning capped by consecutive two-out RBI singles from Iannarone, junior Alyssa Schell and Wenzel.

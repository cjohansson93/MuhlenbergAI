In January, Muhlenberg received accreditation approval from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education for its new graduate programs in applied analytics and organizational leadership, which will begin to be offered in the fall semester. The newly established Muhlenberg College School of Graduate Studies will be led by Dean of Graduate Studies Uppinder Mehan, who began his role in November. Mehan joined Muhlenberg from Moravian College, where he was the dean of the School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and helped launch several new degree programs.
âAdding graduate programs to the rich variety and solid foundation of what we already offer allows us to reach out to those who already have undergraduate degrees and are interested in deepening their knowledge and developing proficiencies, and also to our alumni who have helped make Muhlenberg the highly respected college it is,â Mehan says.
The School of Graduate Studies will offer two masterâs degree programs, one in applied analytics and one in organizational leadership. Extensive market research helped administrators decide to offer these particular programs, says AJ Lemheney, vice president and executive director of Muhlenbergâs Division of Graduate and Continuing Education.
âWhat we found are businesses and government agencies rely on big data to succeed and better serve their customers and communities. Our applied analytics program focuses on helping them carry the best of their past forward, understand the present and use their data to envision their future,â Lemheney says. âLikewise, we found small to large companies and agencies are complex systems of people and processes prone to problems. Our organizational leadership program is an alternative to the MBA for those companies in demand for a leader who thinks holistically, solving complex problems with empathy, ethics and creativity.â Graduate certificates in both areas of study are also being offered as an alternative for those looking only to build specific advanced knowledge and skills in a particular discipline.
With the addition of the School of Graduate Studies and launch of these new programs, Muhlenberg is also changing the name of the Wescoe School of Continuing Education to the Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies. This name âbetter aligns with the Collegeâs strategic plan and brand identity and provides clarity of the schoolâs function within the greater community we serve,â Lemheney says.

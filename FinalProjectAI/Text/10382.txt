Planned gifts, including bequests and life income gifts, are designed to help you meet your financial and charitable goals while supporting Muhlenberg in the long term.
Create your legacy through a planned gift
Charitable gifts extend your generosity well into the future. Did you know that a planned gift can also protect your assets, provide for your family and guarantee you income for life? You can even make a significant impact through a gift that costs nothing in your lifetime through a charitable bequest under your will.  
What to give
Creative gifts of assets can include stocks, bonds and property (real estate and personal property such as artwork). These can not only provide you with charitable deductions, but can also often offer additional tax savings as well.
How to get started
We have partnered with FreeWill to make it simple and free to create your legal will and legacy gift. With their secure online tool, you can make a plan that protects your loved ones and assets, and designates a portion of your legacy to securing Muhlenbergâs future. 
Create your free will and Muhlenberg legacy today.
If you would prefer to finalize your plan with an attorney, you can also save on legal fees by using FreeWill to document your wishes first.
Join the CIRCLE OF 1848
Including Muhlenberg in your estate plan entitles you to membership in the Circle of 1848, an honorary society for alumni, parents and friends who make future plans for the College through trust, estate, life income plans or other future gifts. Learn more about the Circle and planned giving here or complete this membership form to join us immediately.
For more information, contact Ted Kocher, director of planned giving, at theodorekocher@muhlenberg.edu.

Megan Ross  Class of 2017Major in Dance and French & Francophone Studies
Choreographer, Dance Teacher





Megan Rossâ '17 got a rave review for her dance piece at the Richmond Dance Festival 2018. "Highly satisfying and very amusing!" writes RVArt Review. "What a great way to end the evening!" Her piece, "Meep Like a Peep," was originally staged for Muhlenberg's 2016 "Moving Stories" concert, and featured costumes by Resident Costume Designer Lex Gurst. 

Since graduation, Megan has moved to Durham, North Carolina, where she works as a dance instructor and studio manager at a local dance school. In April of this year, she had the opportunity to perform with Tobacco Road Dance Productions, a dance organization in Durham that gives choreographers the chance to get feedback during the creation process and present work in a fully produced dance concert.
This summer, Megan will be on faculty with Bodystories: Teresa Fellion Dance as a Dance Educator at the Ross School in East Hampton, New York.

men’s basketball sweeps past swat


With about 10:30 left in the first half of the men’s basketball game against Swarthmore, Muhlenberg junior Ryan Foster fell hard to the floor, trying to draw a charge. He didn’t get the call, but he did get the rebound 



Frankoski’s previous career high was 16 points against Curry last year.



when the Garnet player’s jumper bounced off the iron right to him. Still on the floor, Foster passed off to Brian Frankoski, who fed Spencer Liddic for a layup seconds later.

That’s the kind of night it was for the Mules, who led 25-8 after that play and breezed to a 79-53 win that solidified their playoff chances.

With three games 
left in the regular season, Muhlenberg (13-9, 9-6) is tied with Gettysburg (a 74-68 loser at Johns Hopkins) for third place in the Centennial Conference. The Mules are a game ahead of fifth-place Haverford, who they swept, and two in front of Washington and Hopkins.

To be frank, the dominant performance by Muhlenberg had little to do with lucky bounces – it had a lot to do with B-Frank.

Inserted into the starting lineup, Frankoski exploded for a career-high 



Foster scored 16 of his 21 points in the first half. He scored 46 points in two games against Swarthmore this year.



20 points on 9-of-10 shooting and added 6 assists and 3 steals. He made all six of his first-half field-goal tries, and of the Mules’ first 20 points, he had a hand in 16, scoring 10 and assisting on a pair of three-pointers.

“Coach wanted to go with a smaller lineup so we could run our offense that opens up room to penetrate,” he explained. “He put me in to hit the holes and find the open shooters.”

One of those shooters was Foster, who came into the game needing seven three-pointers to reach 100 for his career. He almost got there in the first half, making 5-of-6 from long range en route to 21 points.

The Mules shot 50 percent from the field and from three-point range in the first half, opening up a 48-23 lead at halftime. They turned the ball over only once in the first 20 minutes and led by as many as 33 points in the second half. It was a far cry from the first game this season against the Garnet (1-20, 0-15), when Muhlenberg had to sweat out a 73-65 win.

“The energy we brought was unlike the last game,” said Frankoski. “Normally when we get off to good starts we play very well.”

The game was also unlike any other the Mules have played in the last month. Their last 12 games had been decided by an average of 5.3 points; the last four by 2, 3, 4 and 2 points.

“It was nice not to have the pressure of every possession,” admitted Frankoski. “It allowed us to play a little more freely.”

Senior Mike Beranrdini scored 12 points, and Liddic also reached double figures, with 10 points in only 14 minutes.

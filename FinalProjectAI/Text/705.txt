 Samantha Evans Hypermedia: Blood Injustice, Blood In JusticeUpon entering the class with the intent of pursuing a career in law, I explored a true story about a man, Kenneth Waters, who spent eighteen years on death row before he was exonerated with the same DNA evidence that was used to convict him. This project developed as I learned basic HTML skills and website design in Hypermedia. Besides learning how to physically link words on one webpage with images on another webpage, I learned how to literally create new ideas by linking variations of these words and images. A story about the scales of justice eventually expanded to incorporate ideas of motherhood, technology, the rights to privacy, and the concept of an "eye for an eye." Creating the website taught me not only website design skills, but how to think more analytically and more abstractly.

Film Screenings





Class Movie Screenings:
B-02
Professors schedule movie screenings in Trexler Library outside of standard class time; these can be movies owned by the library or a personal copy. These screenings are typically held in B-02, the video classroom, which is located along the west wall of the B-Level concourse. Please consult our B-Level Floor Plan for directions or ask the Lending Services desk staff members for assistance.
Individual Movie Screenings:
A/V Alcove Viewing Stations
Our collection includes films on DVD, Blu-ray, and VHS that are available for check out. Viewing stations for each media type are available along the south wall of the A-Level concourse.    
Library Desktop Computers
All desktop computers in the building have Corel WinDVD to play the DVDs in our collection.
Seminar A
Seminar A is a viewing room equipped with a wall TV unit with a built-in DVD player as well as an HDMI port to connect to a computer. It also contains a wall-mounted whiteboard. This room is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Seminar A can be found on the west side of A-Level concourse in the elevator alcove.
External Optical Drives
The Lending Services Desk now has external DVD/Blu-Ray drives that are available for checkout. These drives connect to PCs/Macs' USB ports and work with little to no installation required. Unfortunately, these drives are not compatible with Chromebooks.

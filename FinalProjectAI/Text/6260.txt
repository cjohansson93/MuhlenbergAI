Men's Lacrosse Falls in Maryland in Last Non-Conference Tuneup
 Saturday, March 10, 2012 - page 2







					 





Freshman Jon Thomas scored a pair of goals for his first career multiple-goal game.


In its final non-conference game of the season, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team lost at St. Mary’s (Md.), 13-11.

Senior Alex Ardolino scored his 50th career goal and junior Ian Jones won a career-high 16 faceoffs for the Mules (2-4), who open Centennial Conference play at home against Franklin & Marshall next Saturday.

St. Mary’s (2-2) has already played three CC teams, toppling defending champion and preseason favorite Dickinson, 12-9, and losing to F&M, 11-5.

Despite the loss, Muhlenberg had another productive day offensively, netting 11 goals three days after putting in 14 in a loss to No. 7 Stevens. It’s the first time since 2005 that the Mules have scored at least 11 goals in consecutive games.
Since getting blanked in the fourth quarter and all four overtime periods in a loss to Scranton last Saturday, the Mules have scored at least two goals in every quarter.

Muhlenberg led, 4-2, after one quarter, but the Seahawks scored four man-up goals in the second quarter and the teams went into the halftime break tied at 7-7. 

St. Mary’s scored the first two goals of the second half to take the lead for good. The Mules closed to within one for the final time at 10-9 with 3:55 left in the third, but the Seahawks scored off the ensuing faceoff and held on.

Ardolino is the eighth player in team history to reach the 50-goal plateau. Senior Corey Aferiat had his second straight multiple-goal game, scoring twice.

Jones’ 16 faceoff wins were two short of the school record, and he also picked up 10 ground balls. Less than halfway through the season, he already ranks fifth on the program’s single-season lists in faceoffs won (75) and ground balls (50).

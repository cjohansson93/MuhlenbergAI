Hot-Shooting Men's Basketball Picks Up First CC Win

 Women’s basketball



In a game of back and forth offense and high shooting percentages, it was a series of defensive stops
that ultimately gave the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team its first Centennial Conference win of the season.

The Mules held Washington without a field goal for more than three minutes down the stretch to pull away
for an 88-82 in their final game of 2014.

Senior Malique Killing scored a game-high 28 points to move into a tie for second place on the
program’s all-time scoring list. Freshman Nick Rindock (left) added 17 points, and
junior Alec Stavetski scored 10 in his first game back from injury.

The Mules (6-4, 1-3) shot 63.6 percent from the field in the first half but found themselves down a point
at halftime to the Shoremen (1-7, 1-3), who shot better than 55 percent themselves. Muhlenberg went ahead
early in the second half on a three-pointer by Rindock and never lost the lead, but Washington stayed within
striking range the whole way.

Once 10 points, the lead was down to two, 74-72, after a Shoremen tipin with 3:57 remaining. Killing and
Stavetski each made a pair of free throws to kick off an 11-2 run that finally put the game out of reach.

Sophomore Jon Schreer hit a three-pointer during the run, and sophomore Brandon LaRose
capped it with a steal and his second dunk of the game.

The Mules held the Shoremen to 41.4-percent shooting in the second half. For the game, Muhlenberg shot 59.6
percent, including a whopping 70.6 percent from two-point range. It helped that many of the shots were
layups or dunks – the two by LaRose and one by freshman Owen McLeod.

Muhlenberg has topped the 80-point mark in all six of its wins.

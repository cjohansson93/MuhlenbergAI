Volleyball drops Buttermaker opener


With the Muhlenberg volleyball team tied with DeSales in the third set Friday night, Brooke McQueen stepped to the service line inside Memorial Hall. 




Davi Gordon added four kills to go along with her 10 digs.




The junior libero calmly delivered two strong serves that forced a pair of Bulldog defensive errors and a third that led to a kill by the Mules Jenn Seeba to give Muhlenberg a three-point lead and force a DeSales timeout.

However, the momentum from that rally was short-lived as the Bulldogs responded by winning eight of the next nine points to close out a three-set win in the opening match of the Buttermaker Tournament. 

Despite four kills from Laurainne Ojo-Ohikuare in each of the first two sets, Muhlenberg fell behind DeSales two-sets to none.

But the Mules (1-4) started kicking in the third set as the two teams traded points until a three-point run put Muhlenberg up 10-8.

The Bulldogs snapped back with a five-point run of their own, followed by a three-point Mule rally and six-side outs to tie the set at 17. McQueen then stepped to the line to give the Mules their largest lead of the match, before DeSales (3-2) ended the evening with one final five-point push.

Ojo-Ohikuare finished with a match-high eight kills to lead the Mules, while Morgan Duggan dished out 15 assists. Davi Gordon and McQueen added 10 digs apiece for Muhlenberg.

Last-Second Goal Dooms Women's Lacrosse at Swarthmore
 Wednesday, April 11, 2012







					 



The heartbreak continued for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team at Swarthmore, and it was the most gut-wrenching game yet.

After leading by three midway through the second half, the Mules withstood a Garnet rally to score the go-ahead goal with 1:57 left. But Swarthmore scored twice in the final 82 seconds, including the game-winner with just two ticks left, to hand the Mules their third straight one-goal loss, 15-14.

Muhlenberg (4-6, 0-6) jumped out to a quick 5-1 lead highlighted by a pair of goals from both sophomore Michelle  Certosimo and junior Molly Davin.

The Garnet (9-4, 3-3) came back to pull even five minutes into the second half when the Mules used a 4-1 run to grab their three-goal lead.

 After Swarthmore rallied again to force another tie at the 2:39 mark, Muhlenberg went back in front when senior Angela Napoletano drove through the heart of the Garnet defense with a penalty flag on the ground and beat the goalie low to make it 14-13 with 1:57 left.

But the Mules were whistled for a pair of yellow cards during the ensuing possession. They appeared to have forced a stop, but a foul call gave the Garnet extra life, which they used to tie the game for the sixth time.

Freshman Stephanie Umbach grabbed the next draw control in a sea of white Swarthmore jerseys, and the Mules were awarded a free-position shot with 35 seconds left. But it was saved, and Swarthmore was able to get down the field just in time to fire off the game-winner.

Napoletano tied her career high with six goals to become the 19th 100-point scorer in program history. She has amassed 103 points in her career. Umbach pulled in a school-record 12 draw controls, eclipsing the old mark by two.

Davin finished with four goals, and Certosimo added three assists to her two goals for her fourth five-point game of the season. With 23 assists on the year, she is three shy of fifth place on the Mule single-season list.

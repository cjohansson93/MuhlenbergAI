Teaching Interests
I approach teaching art as a process of experimentation. Students begin my classes by learning a set of skills from the ground up. They are then encouraged to experiment to obtain unexpected results. In printmaking, students explore color by playing with different combinations of old printing blocks, resulting in unexpected combinations of color and pattern. In an introductory drawing course, students learn to capture the movement of a figure through a series of quick sketches, which are transformed into a short animation.
One of the most rewarding aspects of teaching in the liberal arts is the creative energy that comes from classes that combine students from all different majors and backgrounds. In a course on book arts and history, students had the opportunity to research a rare book in our collection and then create a visual response. Students created projects on womenâs clothing, slavery, British Imperialism and American literature.
As a graduate of a liberal arts program myself, I believe that the most meaningful art comes out of a strong intellectual foundation in multiple disciplines. In my teaching I encourage students to bring their interests into the classroom, and I create opportunities for collaboration and experimentation.

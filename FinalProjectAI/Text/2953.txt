CECCONI EARNS PLAYER OF THE WEEK 



Junior Matt Cecconi of the Muhlenberg men's soccer team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.








Cecconi played all 200 minutes at right back for a Mule defense that posted shutouts at No. 6 Swarthmore (0-0) and against Ursinus (1-0). Cecconi and the Mules allowed the Garnet, which leads the Centennial Conference in goals per game at 2.59, just six shots on goal, then held the Bears to just one shot on net.

Cecconi also scored Muhlenberg's goal against Ursinus, his first of the season and the second of his career.

Cecconi is the third Mule to earn CC defensive player of the week honors this season, and with good reason: The Mules have a CC-low 0.44 goals-against average in conference games.

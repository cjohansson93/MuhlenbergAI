Muhlenberg will host this yearâs Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC) Campus Sustainability Conference 8:30 a.m.â4 p.m, Saturday, February 15, in the Collegeâs Seegers Union.  
Students, faculty, staff and Lehigh Valley residents are welcome to attend the free conference which will feature keynote speaker Michael GagnÃ© (pictured left), an environmental leader, educator and facilitator dedicated to building positive social change. Other highlights include student and faculty presentations, interactive workshops, a poster session and an exhibitor forum. 
âConference presenters will be sharing best practices, innovative programs and problem-solving solutions,â said Kalyna Procyk, who oversees the Office of Campus Sustainability at Muhlenberg. âOur goal is to educate and empower students, faculty and administrators and to inspire concrete action on campuses and in communities throughout the Lehigh Valley.â 
The event is free and open to the public and includes a continental breakfast and lunch. To minimize food waste, registration is required by Wednesday, February 5: https://lvaic.org/event/sustainability-conference/ 
Attendees are strongly encouraged to carpool, use public transportation or take advantage of a campus shuttle service provided for the conference instead of driving personal vehicles. Please indicate on the registration form if transportation is needed. 
The founding members of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC)âCedar Crest College, DeSales University, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Moravian College and Muhlenberg Collegeâalternate hosting the Campus Sustainability Conference each year.
Muhlenberg was recognized as a top performer in the 2019 Sustainable Campus Index, receiving a score of 100 percent for best practices in the area of water conservation. Muhlenberg also recently received a STARS Gold Rating for Sustainability Achievements, the highest level of recognition received by any Lehigh Valley higher education institution, for five overall areas: academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation and leadership.

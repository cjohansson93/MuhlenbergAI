Kelleman, Mules First at Messiah


How do you top having the medalist and finishing second at a tournament? Easy. Have the medalist and finish first.

For the second time in six days, a member of the Muhlenberg men’s golf team won a tournament, as junior Geoffrey Kelleman shot a one-over-par 73 to lead the Mules
to a first-place finish at the Messiah Falcon Classic. Muhlenberg outshot the host school by 11 strokes to win its first tournament since the 2004 Centennial Conference
Championships.

Last Friday, junior Bill Snow earned medalist honors to highlight the Mules’ second-place finish at the Susquehanna Invitational.

Like Snow, Kelleman tied for first place and won on a match of cards. Snow was only two strokes back, and two other Mules finished in the top 10: sophomore Biff Slocum (76)
and senior Garrett Carpenter (77).

Muhlenberg’s team score of 301 was its lowest since a 299 at the 2000 Susquehanna Spring Tee-Off Tournament.

Senior Jillian Duffy recorded two goals and set a school record with three assists to lead the Muhlenberg field hockey team to a dominant 10-1 victory at Bryn Mawr.

The 10 goals were the most scored by the Mules since 1969, when they posted an 11-0 shutout against Moravian. Nine different players found their way into the scoring

column, including junior Julie deLaurentis (right), a back who capped the scoring with her first career goal.

“It’s always an adjustment to play on the grass,” said senior Kelly Shetron, who contributed two goals and two assists. “We played strongly and got a good win.”

The Mules (8-3, 4-0 CC) controlled the match from the start, keeping the ball in the Owls’ half of the field and having a shot hit the post before 
sophomore Tara Cohn scored her first career goal with 7:15 elapsed. 

Sophomore Nicki Notarianni doubled the Mules’ lead 9:03 into the game with an assist from Shetron, who added a goal herself at the 13:06 mark off a helper by Cohn.

Freshman Chessie Martinez completed Muhlenberg’s first-half scoring by converting senior Lauren Rutt’s centering pass with 14:39 left in the period.

Bryn Mawr gained possession in the Mules’ circle late in the half, when they won their only penalty corner of the game. That penalty corner set up the only Owl goal of the game.

Shetron scored 10 minutes into the second half off of her own rebound and the Mules went on a tear, with Duffy and sophomore Kristen Sabia netting two goals each over the next 10:07.

Bryn Mawr never controlled the ball on Muhlenberg’s half of the field in the second period; the Mules outshot the Owls 29-0 in the second half and 43-2 in the game. They held a 19-1 advantage in penalty corners.

“We wanted to come away with a solid victory,” Shetron said. “Now we’re 4-0 in the conference, which is good for us going into more challenging games.”

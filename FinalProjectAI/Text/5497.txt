Volleyball storms into championship bracket





Lee leads Muhlenberg in kills per set (3.38).


Hurricane Phylicia stormed through Memorial Hall the night before Tropical Storm Hanna was scheduled to make an impact in Allentown.

Junior Phylicia Lee packed quite a wallop, recording 33 kills and making only 
two errors as the Muhlenberg volleyball team breezed past King’s and Medaille to win its pool at the Buttermaker Tournament.

The Mules (5-1) advance to the Championship Bracket, where they will have to earn their first Buttermaker title since 2005. Stevens and defending champion York, both of which won 30 matches last year, also won their pools.

More heavy hitting from Lee will certainly help. She hit at an extraordinary .484 clip in the two matches, notching 17 kills vs. King’s and 16 vs. Medaille. Three of her kills came in the second half of the first set against King’s as Muhlenberg erased a 16-12 deficit to win, 25-23.

In the second set, the Mules broke a 20-all tie by scoring five of the last six points, and they opened up an early 11-6 lead en route to a 25-13 victory in the third set.

Junior Megan Eiser totaled 36 assists in the victory, and junior Christina Cangelosi scooped out a team-high 18 digs.

After winning the first set against Medaille comfortably, 25-16, Muhlenberg used a different lineup in the second set and lost, 25-22. That was the end of that. With their regular rotation in play, the Mules overwhelmed the Mavericks, 25-7 and 25-5, to claim the match.

Eiser recorded a double-double with 24 assists and 19 digs.

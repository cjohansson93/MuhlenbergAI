Third-seeded Muhlenberg concluded its 2008 campaign with a loss in the semifinal stage of the Centennial Conference playoffs, dropping a 5-2 decision to the No. 2 seed Swarthmore. 

The Garnet repeated its victory from the regular-season match, in which it claimed a 5-4 triumph. The playoff match was stopped once Swarthmore scored its fifth point.

The two points on the day for Muhlenberg were brought by freshmen. Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt came out victorious at No. 3 doubles, 8-5. 
Classmate Sara Sutker clinched a straight-set win at No. 4 singles, limiting her opponent to four games, 6-3, 6-1.

The Mules finished with a 9-5 overall record, wrapping up a season that saw them reclaim their prestige as one of the league’s top teams.

The Muhlenberg men’s golf team took the lead on the first day of the Centennial Conference Championships, held at The Bridges Golf Club in Abbottstown, Pa.

In the first of three rounds, the Mules shot a 304, seven strokes better 


than second-place McDaniel. Gettysburg was 10 strokes back at 314.

Muhlenberg’s score was the third-lowest in an opening round in the history of the CC Championships. Franklin & Marshall opened with a 301 last year en route to the title and a 303 in 2005, when it finished second.

The 304 also was the best mark ever posted by the Mules at the CC tourney, one stroke better than their second-round 305 in the championship season of 2004.

Junior Bill Snow (right) carded a one-over-par 73 to tie for the early lead and match his career best, achieved at F&M his freshman year and tied at Susquehanna this fall.

Junior Geoffrey Kelleman was two strokes behind with a 75, and sophomore Biff Slocum and freshman Zachary Oyer each ended with a 78, giving Muhlenberg four in the top 10.

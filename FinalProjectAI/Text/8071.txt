Flank Finishes 14th at Cross Country Regional
 Saturday, November 15, 2014 - page 3







					 





Sophomore Jaryd Flank of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team put himself in a position to
run in the NCAA Championships by placing 14th at the NCAA Mideast Regional.

The Mule men came in 15th out of 47 teams in the region for their 16th consecutive season in the top 20. The women,
whose top runner was ill, finished 17th out of 52 teams, landing in the top 20 for the 17th time in 18 years.

Flank (right) earned all-region honors with his 14th-place finish – an impressive 69-place improvement from his regional finish
last year. If the NCAA selects four teams from the Mideast Region, he will earn a bid to nationals, but if only three teams from
the region are picked, he will not. Individual bids are given to the top runners not on qualifying teams.

The NCAA Division III Championships are schedule for next Saturday at Mason, Ohio.

The men came in ahead of Gettysburg, a team it trailed at the Centennial Conference Championships two weeks ago. Senior
Luke Munyan came in 60th place, up from 63rd last year.

The women were led by junior Claire Thornton, who finished 69th a year after coming in 113th.

Mallory Snyder came in 74th overall and 14th among freshmen in the region.

In the Matte Award competition, the Mules split with Moravian, with the men winning.

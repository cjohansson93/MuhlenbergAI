Muhlenberg mourns the loss of Linda Bips, assistant professor of psychology


Bips passed away on January 14, 2016. The thoughts and prayers of the Muhlenberg College community are with her family, friends, students and colleagues.


	 Tuesday, January 19, 2016  06:10 PM

Linda Bips was part of the Muhlenberg community for thirty years. As a licensed psychologist, she was director of the Muhlenberg College Counseling Center and an integral member of the Student Affairs team from 1985-1999 before turning to full-time teaching. She was nationally recognized for her program "Letting Go,” delivered to parents of students entering their first year of college.
In 1999, Bips joined Muhlenberg’s psychology department. She taught introductory psychology courses as well as abnormal psychology, the psychology of women and First Year Seminars in the psychosocial development of women and meanings of madness. She had also taught “Writing Identity Abroad,” a study trip and spring semester course with the English department’s Linda Miller.
Bips’ research interests included psychosocial development of women, counseling, college age development and parenting. She was the author of “Parenting College Freshmen: Consulting for Adulthood.” She began a two-year phased retirement plan in Fall 2014 and had planned to retire fully at the conclusion of the Spring 2016 semester.
Bips received her B.A. from Dickinson College, M.Ed. from Kutztown University and Ed.D. from Lehigh University.
Bips’ daughters are planning a celebration of life service. It will take place on campus in February, with more details to come. Donations can be made to Muhlenberg College and should be designated for the Linda Bips Memorial Fund. Bips' obituary may be viewed on Legacy.com.

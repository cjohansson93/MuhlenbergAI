Baseball Comes Back to Beat Nationally Ranked Haverford
 Sunday, April 14, 2013







					 





Cody became the 10th Mule to record at least three hits in a game this season, going 3-for-5 to raise his average to .313.


Spotting nationally ranked teams six-run leads usually isn’t a good strategy. On Tuesday, the Muhlenberg baseball team fell behind 23rd-ranked Haverford 6-0 in the first inning, and although the Mules cut the margin to one, they wound up losing, 17-9.

In the return meeting, the Fords again opened up a 6-0 lead, but this time Muhlenberg completed the comeback.

The Mules scored three runs in fifth and five in the sixth en route to a 9-6 win, their second big come-from-behind victory in as many days. The wins put Muhlenberg (16-13, 4-6) right in the thick of a crowded Centennial Conference race, in which the second- through eighth-place teams are separated by just two games with eight left to play.

The defeat of the Fords (20-6, 5-5) was made possible by superb relief pitching from sophomore Nick Gies and senior Ryan Rechten. Gies tossed 5 2/3 innings of scoreless, one-hit relief, facing the minimum 12 batters from the fourth through the seventh innings. Rechten pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his 12th career save, one short of the school record.

Muhlenberg’s comeback began in the fifth when senior John Muha reached on an infield error and scored on a sacrifice fly by senior Joseph Vila. A triple by junior Max Litvak and a single by junior Nick Kennedy brought in two more runs.

In the sixth, the Mules loaded the bases with nobody out on two walks sandwiched around a single by junior John Scuderi. Muha drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 6-4, and sophomore Jimmy Cody singled to get Muhlenberg within a run. Vila then hit a potential double-play ball, but the throw to first was wild, allowing the tying and go-ahead runs to score.

Sophomore Kurt Johnson capped the big inning with an RBI single, one of three hits he had in the game, and the Mules added an unearned run in the ninth.

Vila’s two RBIs gave him 104 for his career, moving him into third place on the program’s all-time list. He also scored his 99th career run and needs to touch home plate one more time to become only the third Mule to reach the century mark in runs and RBI.

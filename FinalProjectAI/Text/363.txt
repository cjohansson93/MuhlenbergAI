What courses do I need to take to complete both degrees?
The 4+1 program partners the Masterâs in Applied Analytics program and Muhlenberg Collegeâs Department of Mathematics and Computer Science to create the most streamlined option for students to complete both degrees over five years. Students completing the following undergraduate courses, with the specified level of proficiency, will satisfy the following foundational graduate courses requirement:

MTH 219 Statistical Models satisfies credit requirement for MAA 502 Statistical Tools for Analytics
MTH 319 Title to Be Determined satisfies the credit requirement for MAA 506 Predictive Analytics
CSI 220 Data Structures and Algorithms satisfy the credit requirement for MAA 512 An Introduction to Programming Languages
CSI 305 Database Systems satisfies the credit requirement for MAA 508 Data Warehousing & Mining

To demonstrate proficiency, students must earn a B or better in each of the undergraduate courses for them to count towards the 4 + 1 MAA. As outlined below, each of these undergraduate courses also captures skills and knowledge included in prerequisite courses.
Undergraduate students may also elect to take courses within the Masterâs in Applied Analytics program that may count toward their elective undergraduate credit. As in the above model, only four courses can be counted towards both degrees.
For the student choosing the Mathematics and Computer Science 4+1 pathway, the courses map onto the MAA first-year curriculum as shown in the chart below.  And in the +1 year, students will join the ongoing cohort of MAA students to complete the graduate courses and capstone.

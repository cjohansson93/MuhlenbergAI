Mens lax falls just short of upset 



Two Others Also Beaten by Dickinson


The Muhlenberg womens tennis team lost to Dickinson (8-4, 4-1) for the first time in 10 matches, 5-4.

Juniors Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker won the Mules (3-4, 2-3) lone doubles point at No. 1, 8-4, and then both won close singles matches. Junior Danielle Winston added a 6-2, 6-2 win at No. 3 singles. Classmate Lindsay Schmidt battled at No. 4 singles but dropped the second and decisive set in a tiebreak, 7-5.

Womens lacrosse also fell to Dickinson, 16-10. 

The Red Devils (6-2, 3-1) built a big 7-1 lead in the first 11 minutes and led 10-3 at halftime. Dickinson then netted six of the first eight in the second half.

Junior Danielle Rosen led the Mules (6-4, 1-3) with five goals and an assist. Junior Lauren DeCarle picked up a game-high five ground balls and senior Ashley Foltiny caused a game-best four turnovers.

The Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team was just five minutes away from another huge Centennial Conference win before No. 5 Dickinson rallied in the closing stages.

The Mules led, 10-8, after a man-up goal from freshman Jack Reilly with 11:24 to play. But the Red Devils scored the next four  the tying goal coming with 4:21 remaining and the go-ahead 56 seconds later  to stave off the upset, 12-10.




Senior Ivan Brown carries the ball upfield.





Ursinus (9-8 to Haverford) and McDaniel (15-6 to No. 2 Gettysburg) both also lost, keeping the race for the playoffs extremely tight. The Mules (4-5, 3-3) final two regular-season games are against McDaniel and Ursinus, meaning that even after losing to Dickinson they are in good position to secure a playoff berth if they win out.

Muhlenberg stormed out of the gate against Dickinson (11-1, 4-1), scoring the first three goals of the game. Reilly found sophomore Alex Ardolino for a man-up goal 2:14 in, and senior Ari Jacobson found the back of the net 2:10 later.

Junior Brent Siebold scored another man-up goal, on a feed from sophomore Corey Aferiat, to make it 3-0. The Red Devils finally got on the board two minutes later, but senior Al Carpetto set Reilly up to make it 4-1.

It was all Dickinson the rest of the quarter, however, as it scored three goals in a 1:22 span  including two just six seconds apart, with the second coming after a faceoff win and sprint down field  to tie the game.

With the score tied at 6-6 late in the second quarter, senior Sean Delany scored his first goal of the season just under the four-minute mark to give the Mules a one-goal lead going into halftime.

Ardolino scored a quick one out of the break, and with Muhlenberg leading 8-7, junior Andy Curley, a defenseman, scored a remarkable goal, picking up a ground ball in his own end and racing the length of the field, where he buried his first career goal on his first career shot.

But Dickinson scored an important goal with 38.6 seconds left in the quarter, and then, after Reilly again made it a two-goal game, went on a 4-0 run to close it out.

Junior Mike Horowitz had yet another tremendous game in goal, stopping 15 shots. Sophomore Nick Rispoli won 8 of 16 faceoffs and picked up a team-high five ground balls. Curley caused two turnovers, including one on a huge hit near midfield in the fourth quarter.

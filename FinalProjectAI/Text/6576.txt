Bullets Bite Playoff Chances for Three Mule Teams
 Saturday, October 20, 2012 - page 3







					 



Three Muhlenberg teams lost to Gettysburg in contests that had playoff implications.



Field Hockey


Gettysburg broke a 1-1 tie early in the second half and held on for a 2-1 win.

The loss dropped the Mules (9-6, 4-5) from a tie for fifth place to seventh place in the Centennial Conference. They are still alive for a playoff berth, but they will need to win at Ursinus in their season finale next Saturday.

After pregame ceremonies to honor seniors Dana Disimile, Kristen Dornenburg and Devon Barber, Muhlenberg came out strong, taking eight shots (including a penalty stroke) in the first 10:19. But the Mules failed to put one in, and the Bullets (11-3, 6-2) scored the first goal on a penalty stroke with 6:51 left in the first half.

Less than two minutes later, Muhlenberg tied it up. Sophomore Lauren Jordan (left), in her first game back from injury, converted a pass from sophomore Christine Germaske for her third goal of the season.


Gettysburg scored 5:38 into the second half. The Mules’ best chance to tie came when a shot by junior Erin Cummings trickled just wide with 16:03 left.

Dornenburg saved a penalty stroke for the third time in two games late in the second half to keep it a one-goal game. Junior Ashley DeAngelis recorded two defensive saves to move to within one of the school record of 12 in a season.

Women’s Soccer



The Mules had their six-game CC unbeaten and unscored-upon streak snapped with a 1-0 loss to Gettysburg.

The Bullets (11-4, 7-1) scored off a corner kick with 14:14 left in the first half. It was the first goal allowed by Muhlenberg in CC play in more than 590 minutes.

The Mules (7-7-2, 5-3-1), who saluted seniors Alyssa Meola, Jillian Moretto, Maggie Neary and Natalie Wizel prior to the game, are still in fourth place in the CC and can clinch a playoff berth with a win at Ursinus (0-5-4) next Saturday.

Volleyball


A 3-0 loss to Gettysburg eliminated Muhlenberg from CC playoff contention.

The Mules (16-10, 3-6) rebounded to defeat York in their second match of the day, squandering a 2-0 lead before winning the fifth set, 15-11.

Freshman Joanne Josephson recorded a career-high 13 kills without an error in the latter match. Sophomore Holly Hynson had 14 kills and 18 digs for her fifth double-double of the season, and sophomore Alyssa Schell had 22 digs, one off her career high.

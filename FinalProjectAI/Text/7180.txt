Men's Soccer Wins Second Straight on Dotzman Goal
 Wednesday, September 4, 2013







					 





The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team started the week on a positive note, earning a No. 9 ranking in the Mid-Atlantic Region in the first National Soccer Coaches Association of America poll of the season. The Mules wasted no time in making sure the good times kept rolling.

Junior Lance Dotzman finished a nifty feed from freshman Jack Dusing in the 32nd minute, giving the Mules all they would need in a 1-0 victory at Wilkes. Dotzman’s right-footed strike into a wide-open net secured the first career assist for Dusing, who ran down a long ball in the right side of the box and slotted a perfect pass into the middle to Dotzman, the midfielder converting easily for his second career goal.

“I saw [Dusing] on the ball and I know he likes to cut it back,” Dotzman said of his game-winner. “I put my run to the penalty spot, and just made it count.”



No Upset This Time for Field Hockey


Last year, when the Muhlenberg field hockey posted a monumental 2-1 upset of Montclair State, the only goal it allowed came on a penalty corner after time had expired.

This time, the Red Hawks – who would not lose again until the Division III national championship game and are ranked No. 2 in the preseason poll – started
their scoring much earlier, netting two goals in the first 10 minutes and going on to a 6-1 win.

Junior Christine Germaske scored on a long breakaway early in the second half to break up the shutout. Senior Ashley DeAngelis
recorded two defensive saves.

While Dotzman and Dusing supplied the offense, the Mule defense did the rest. Muhlenberg didn’t allow a shot on goal until 30 minutes remained in the second half against a team that found the back of the net five times in its season opener, helping sophomore goalie Ellison Heil earn his second consecutive shutout.  Muhlenberg, which posted a 2-0 victory over Neumann on Saturday, has not been scored upon since the 59th minute of a season-opening loss to nationally ranked Rutgers-Camden, a streak of 211 minutes. The Colonels managed just five shots for the contest, compared to 16 (6 on goal) for the Mules.




Dotzman’s shot (above) led to this celebration.




Wilkes earned a corner with just over three minutes to play, and another in the final minute, but the Mules were able to clear the ball out of danger in both instances  to preserve the slim margin.

“Defensively, we’ve been very good this year,” Dotzman said. “[Senior captain] Jonathan Schauer has been great as a vocal leader, and it definitely helps the team.”

Dusing nearly made it a two-assist night, playing in senior Jeff Reinhart with a beautiful through ball down the right flank with 17 minutes to play. With a defender on his hip, Reinhart took aim for the left corner of the net and steered it wide. Dusing was all over the field after entering the game in the 27th minute, and is quickly developing into a dangerous weapon on the outside.

“He’s got a lot of energy,” Dotzman said of the Mules’ young striker. “When he comes in, he puts it all out there. He’s good in the air, he works his butt off and gets down the line. You can always count on him.”

Once again, the Mules were able to count on their defense to save the day, despite walking off the field feeling like they could have added an extra goal or two to the margin. Still, don’t expect to hear anyone complaining about back-to-back shutouts.

“We definitely need to do a better job of scoring on our chances,” Dotzman said. “We’ll be better next time.”

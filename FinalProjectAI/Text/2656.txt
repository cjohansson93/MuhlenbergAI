field renovation underway


The Muhlenberg Mule in the center of Frank Marino Field is getting a facelift this summer.

Renovation of the field began this week with the removal of the AstroTurf 12 carpet, which was installed in 1998. The backing will also be removed, leaving a stone field.

The new surface will be AstroTurf GameDay Grass 3D, a hybrid of polyethylene and nylon. For information on the new surface, click here.

The target completion date is August 1. Pictures will be posted on the Web site throughout the process.

were stripped down to the stone.

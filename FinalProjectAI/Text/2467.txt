Football re-enters top 25 


For the second time this season, the Muhlenberg football team is ranked in the Division III top 25. 


	 Monday, November 3, 2014  03:24 PM

The Muhlenberg football team is ranked 25th in Division III in the new American Football Coaches Association poll. 
The Mules (7-1) were ranked 23rd six weeks ago before suffering their only loss of the season to No. 8 Johns Hopkins. Since then they have reeled off four straight wins, the last three by an average of 28 points.
In the D3football.com poll, Muhlenberg is receiving eight votes.
With two weeks to go in the regular season, the Mules have already secured their fifth straight year with at least seven wins, matching the school record set from 2000 to 2004.
The Mules, who host Ursinus in their final scheduled home game this Saturday, also rank in the top 25 in Division III in several statistical categories. They are third in fewest interceptions thrown, sixth in fewest turnovers lost, 12th in blocked kicks, 13th in rushing defense, 14th in third-down conversion defense, 16th in kickoff return defense and sacks, 20th in fourth-down conversion defense, 23rd in punt returns and total defense and 25th in scoring defense.
Indvidually, senior Michael Long (with football, celebrating his second touchdown in Saturday’s 34-20 win at Dickinson) is tied for the Division III lead for touchdown catches by a tight end (7).

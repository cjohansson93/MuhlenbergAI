Two Time Pushcart Prize-Winning Poet Terrance Hayes Gives Public Reading at âBerg

	 Friday, November 1, 2013  02:03 PM

Pushcart Prize-winner Terrance Hayes will give a reading at Muhlenberg College on November 4, 2013 at 7:00 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. This event, part of the Living Writers series, is free and open to the public.
Hayes is the author of four books of poetry: Lighthead, which won the National Book Award for Poetry, Wind in a Box, winner of a Pushcart Prize, Hip Logic, winner of the 2001 National Poetry Series and a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and Muscular Music, winner of the Kate Tufts Discovery Award.  His poems have appeared in literary journals and magazines including The New Yorker, Poetry, The American Poetry Review, Ploughshares, Fence, The Kenyon Review and Jubilat Harvard Review. His poetry has also been featured on “The NewsHour” with Jim Lehrer.
He writes about his art: "The dimensions of culture remain at the center of my professional and personal goals, permeating not only the themes of my work, but my relationships with audiences, colleagues and students."
He has been a recipient of many honors and awards, including two Pushcart selections, four Best American Poetry selections, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and the Guggenheim Foundation.
Living Writers, established in 1994, is a course offered once every three years that brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening.
The final reading of the series will be given by writer Chris Ware on November 18, 2013.

faust ties for fourth at national meet


    



In her last time competing in the pole vault for Muhlenberg, Alex Faust gave the definitive answer to the appropriate question that has been asked for the last four 



years: “How high can she go?”

Fourth.

Faust tied for fourth in the pole vault at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championships, hosted by Baldwin-Wallace, to earn All-America honors for the third
time. It was her best finish yet, topping her seventh-place showing outdoors in 2009 and her sixth-place finish indoors this year.

The fourth-place finish was the best ever by a member of the Mule women’s track and field team at an NCAA meet; one male placed higher. Only one female in any
sport in the College’s history placed higher at a national championship event.

Faust is the first three-time All-American in Muhlenberg women’s athletic history, and she is the first member of the track and field program (male or female) to earn All-America
honors at three different NCAA meets.

Faust was successful on her first three attempts to secure All-America status. She was one miss from being eliminated before clearing the bar at 12-6¾ on her third try
to ensure finishing in the top five. She failed to clear the next height, 12-10¾, which was two inches higher than her school-record mark.

The other Muhlenberg athlete in the meet, Jennifer Lynch, did not qualify for the final in the 1,500 meters.

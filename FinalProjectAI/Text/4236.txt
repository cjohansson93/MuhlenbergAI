women’s tennis picks up love-ly win





The younger members of the Muhlenberg women's tennis team showed their love for the four seniors on the team on Senior Day. And then the four seniors showed they have some love in them too.

The seniors - Caitie Druker, Lindsay Schmidt, Sara Sutker and Danielle Winston - combined to win four sets at love, leading the Mules to a 9-0 shutout of Gettysburg.

Muhlenberg (3-2, 1-1), ranked 15th in the Atlantic South Region, celebrated its Senior Day unusually early in the season because it was the only match for which the parents of all four players were available. The parents didn't get to see much of their daughters on the court, however, as the Mules made quick work of all nine matches.

Gettysburg won only seven games in the three 



Gettysburg Wins Two


The Muhlenberg mens lacrosse and womens tennis teams scored big home wins against Gettysburg, but in womens lacrosse and mens tennis it was the Bullets who came out on top.

In womens lacrosse, the Mules were looking for their first win ever against the Bullets, who are ranked fourth in Division III. Muhlenberg trailed only 5-1 before Gettysburg scored twice in the final 22 seconds of the first half. The Bullets then added the first six goals of the second half and went on to win, 16-5.

Senior Danielle Rosen scored three goals in the Mules second consecutive loss to a top-10 team. Senior Lauren DeCarle had a big day on defense, with eight ground balls, six caused turnovers (one short of the school record and the most by a Mule in seven years) and five draw controls.

doubles matches and 16 in the six singles matches. The top two doubles teams kept pace with each other in the race for the school record for career wins, with Winston and Schmidt remaining one ahead of Druker and Sutker.

Sutker's love-love win at No. 2 singles was the fourth 6-0, 6-0 shutout of her career. Winston, known for her long matches, won in a tidy 6-0, 6-1, as did Schmidt.

All told, it was a feel-good day for Muhlenberg, which needed one after suffering a disappointing Centennial Conference loss to Swarthmore on Wednesday. The team returned to its winning ways, and the seniors got some recognition in prematch ceremonies.

"Coming on to the team as a freshman, I felt really nervous," said Nina Sanders, who won at No. 3 singles and No. 3 doubles. "I wasn't sure if I was going to be welcomed. But all the seniors are overwhelmingly friendly. They're all great people, and I can't imagine playing without them next year."

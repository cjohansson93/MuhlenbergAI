City of Allentown Student Overlay District Information â
 
What is the Student Overlay District?
In an attempt to protect the neighborhoods around Allentown Colleges, the City of Allentown zoning regulations were changed in 1997 and the Allentown Student Residence Overlay District was created. The overlay district was expanded in spring of 2018.  The purpose of the Student Residence Overlay district is to limit the negative effects on single family homes around a college created by overcrowding, additional parking needs, and lack of maintenance on the structure and grounds. It is intended to keep the " residential character" of the neighborhood.  This Allentown Zoning Regulation may have an effect on any property being considered as a rental for college students. 
 
How does this zoning ordinance impact you?
If the property is in the Student Residence Overlay District, it may only be rented out to 1 or 2 students max. Renting to 3 or more college students makes the property a Student Residence which is not allowed under the Student Residence Overlay District. If you are part of a group greater than 2 students this may impact you.
Where is the Student Residence Overlay District?
It is bounded on the north by Washington Street, on the west by North Broad Street, on the east by 19th and Leh streets and on the south by Parkway Boulevard. The district incorporates an L-shaped swath of properties in the 1900 block of Chew Street and the 200 block of N. 20th. Basically all the streets surrounding Muhleneberg for several blocks in every direction.
If you need assistance determining if a property is in the overlay please contact Housing & Residence Life (484)-664-3180
Are there exceptions to the ordinance?
Yes. There is a list of properties that have âgrandfatheredâ status. These are the only properties in the overlay where more than 2 students can reside. However, only up to 4 students can reside in these properties. Here is a list of properties:

This list was confirmed with the Allentown Planning and Zoning Office 11/10/2021. If the landlords fail to register for the 2022-2023 academic year, the residence may not be approved by the Allentown Zoning Board to have more than two residents.
What if my property is not on the list of exceptions but the landlord is telling me that the property can be rented to more than 2 students?
There are landlords who knowingly will attempt to violate this ordinance. If you are not sure please contact Housing & Residence Life (484) 664-3180. During the process to get approved for off campus housing you will need to supply the College with your intended off campus address. However, please be aware that violating properties could be at risk of action by the City of Allentown. Before you sign a lease make sure you have verified it is in compliance.

The big hit was elusive as the Mules fell to Moravian for the first time in six years.

Muhlenberg (6-7) fell into a 6-0 hole after three innings but had good chances to come back when it loaded the bases with nobody out in the fifth and seventh innings. The Mules netted only one run in the two frames and went on to lose, 8-3.

Junior Eric Hammond continued his hot hitting, going 3-for-5 with two bunt singles and an RBI single to center. He is 10-for-19 in his last five games.

The result knotted the Matte Award standings for 2007-08 at six apiece.

Freshman goalie Allisyn Vachon of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Vachon posted a 5.52 goals-against average and .636 save percentage in Muhlenberg’s non-conference wins against Moravian and Widener. She made eight saves in the Widener game, three on free-position shots, keeping the Pride off the scoreboard for the first 28 minutes.

Vachon, who is fourth in the CC with an 8.94 goals-against average, will face a Dickinson offense that is second in the league in scoring tomorrow.

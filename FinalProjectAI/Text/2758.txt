baseball season ends in cc playoffs




Hammond was the ninth Mule to get a home run reception at home plate in 2008.



The Muhlenberg baseball team fell into a quick hole and could never recover, falling to Haverford, 13-6, in the Centennial Conference playoffs. The loss ended the Mules’
season with a 20-20 record.

The Fords, who went on to defeat Franklin & Marshall to earn a date with Johns Hopkins in the championship game, began the game with three singles, a walk
and a double from their first five batters to take a 4-0 lead. The margin swelled to 11-0 before the Mules started mounting a comeback attempt.

Consecutive RBI singles by sophomore Dan Fisher and senior Joe Carlo plated the first two runs in the bottom of the sixth. The next inning featured two
home runs: a solo round-tripper by junior Eric Hammond, the first of his career, and a two-run blast off the bat of junior Christian Conti, his 11th of the season.
Conti’s homer was a prodigious shot to left-center that landed in Homewood Field, across the street, on one bounce.

Fisher led off the eighth with a triple and scored to make it 12-6, but that was as close as Muhlenberg would get.

Conti finished the game 3-for-4 and ended his remarkable year with a school-record 60 RBI. His .810 slugging percentage was the second-best in a season in team history.

Fisher also had three hits, while Carlo drove in a pair of runs in his last game.

Hammond led off the ninth with a double, his second extra-base hit of the game and Muhlenberg’s school-record 103rd extra-base hit of the season.

Created by students in 2006 and named for founding director DesirÃ©e Sedehi â08, the Sedehi Diversity Project (or SDP for short) is a campus resource dedicated to fostering conversations about diversity and multiculturalism at Muhlenberg College. Every year, the SDP produces a new documentary theatre piece for Orientation Weekend, created by an ensemble of students drawn from all corners of the campus map. Each yearâs play stages the actual words of Muhlenberg students, professors, staff members and administrators as they talk confidentially about what it means to be part of a diverse college community. Often controversial, the views expressed in each yearâs play are not intended to speak for either the College or SDP ensemble. Rather, they are intended to provide new students with an informed glimpse into real campus conversations about the issues, in the hope that the conversations continue.
The Sedehi Diversity Project is a cross-campus initiative. It is sponsored by:

the Office of Multicultural Life
the Office of the Dean of Students
the Office of the Dean of Academic Life
the Office of the Provost
S.O.L.E (the Office of Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement)

with additional support provided by:

the Department of Theatre & Dance
the Office of Housing & Residence Life
the Department of Athletics

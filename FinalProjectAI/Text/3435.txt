two mules honored by lvaiaw



Two Muhlenberg senior athletes were honored at the Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW) luncheon last week. 

Jenn Powell was voted the Outstanding Athlete in women’s tennis of all the schools in the LVAIAW (Cedar Crest, DeSales, Kutztown, Lafayette, Lehigh,
Moravian and Muhlenberg). This was the third time in the last five years that a Mule player won the top honor for the sport of tennis.

A three-time first-team All-Centennial Conference selection, Powell played No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles for the last three years and finished her career with an
overall record of 83-54 (41-28 in singles and 42-26 in doubles). She went 17-16 in 2009 and was in the top 20 in the Atlantic South Region for both singles (No. 19) and doubles (No. 18)
in the latest ITA rankings. 

Lauren Boyle was named Muhlenberg’s Outstanding Athlete. The three-time first-team All-CC basketball player finished her career second on the Mules’ all-time
lists in points (1,505) and field goals (603), fourth in assists (282) and fifth in free throws (258). She led Muhlenberg to a sparkling 92-21 record and three CC
championships in her four years. Boyle was an all-region selection and averaged 14.0 points per game for the 2009 Mule team that reached the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Division III Tournament.

The Muhlenberg track and field teams made a short trip to the Lehigh Multi and Invite, their last competition before their lone home meet of the season next Friday.

The Mules competed well against a field that included athletes from Divisions I, II and III.

Sophomore Samantha Mayden was the lone Mule to win an event, capturing the 3,000 meters. Her time of 10:40.47 landed her in fourth place on the all-time performance list.

Sophomore Lexie Daniells made the performance list in 400 while coming in third, running more than a second faster than she did last week. Freshman Nicole Cronin made the performance list in the mile, although she only finished in 13th place.

Freshman Stephanie Carnevale placed third in the 60-meter hurdles, running faster in the finals than in the prelims. Another freshman, Erin Saucier, improved her pole vault by four inches from last week.

For the men, sophomores Brendan Smith and Nate Crossette (above) got the weekend off to a good start by placing third and seventh, respectively, in the 5,000 on Friday night. Senior Bobby Torphy was third in both the mile and the 800.

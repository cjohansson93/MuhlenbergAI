Richard Nixon and Television: A Successful Relation-ship?
Although many Americans remember Richard Nixon as âTricky Dick,âa politician of questionable moral character who would do anything andeverything to advance his political career, few recognize his remarkableinfluence in shaping the common practices of political television that isseen today. In following Nixonâs use of television throughout his entirenational political career, it is apparent that Nixonâs relationship with themedia was a double-edged sword, both helping and harming his imagethroughout his time in politics. Through analyzing Nixonâs successesand failures in his television appearances, it is apparent not only thatNixon had the best success in using television the more scripted theevent, but also that other influences within the media often contributedto the publicâs overall attitude toward the President. As television became the most popular medium to reach the American public during this time, it is clear through studying Nixonâs use of television that he unquestionably transformed the operations of political campaigns, and more generally, American politics as a whole.

External Funding Opportunities
The Collegeâs Development Office and Provost's office assist Muhlenberg faculty in their advancement of professionally significant research. While the Provostâs Office provides a number of internally funded, competitive research opportunities, all applicants are strongly encouraged to explore thoroughly the possibilities of external grants and should indicate the progress they have made in finding such support with the Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations Office. Individuals planning proposals for external grants should contact Deb Kipp, Assistant Vice President for Development and Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations, for information and assistance.
The Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations Office is responsible, on behalf of Muhlenberg College, to ensure that proposals are consistent with College policies and sponsor proposal guidelines and that commitments made in proposals can be honored if the proposal is funded. This office will assist in narrative development, budget preparation, indirect cost verification, fringe benefit calculations, cover letters, endorsement letters, securing matching funds, 501Â© (3) forms, etc.
The Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations Office is the only College office authorized to submit proposals that comply fully with sponsor and university guidelines on behalf of Muhlenberg College. Accordingly the Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations Office is also authorized to elect NOT to submit proposals that do not comply fully with sponsor and university submission guidelines. It is College policy that no external grants, including faculty research and professional development grants, can be submitted without joint approval of the Provostâs Office and the Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations Office.

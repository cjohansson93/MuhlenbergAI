men’s lax lands four on All-CC teams 





A record four Muhlenberg mens lacrosse players received All-Centennial Conference recognition.

Junior Nick Rispoli was named to the first team, while seniors Tom Brant and Mike Horowitz, and junior Clint Watkins were second-team selections.

The fifth player in Mule history to be named to the first team, Rispoli (top right) was selected as a faceoff specialist. He leads the conference in ground balls per game (5.36) and ranks second in the CC, and in the top 30 nationally, in faceoff winning percentage (.614).

Rispoli set school single-season records for ground balls (75), faceoffs won (116, the third most in CC history) and faceoff percentage. He also ranks in the top 10 on Muhlenbergs career lists for ground balls (7th, 165) and faceoff wins (4th, 165).

Horowitz (bottom right), who received honorable mention last season, was named the second-team goalie. He ranks fourth in the conference in both save percentage (.603) and saves per game (11.71). He finished his career with 405 saves, the fourth-best total in program history.

Brant (top left) picked up his first all-conference award after anchoring one of the stiffest defenses in the CC. He picked up 54 ground balls on the year (the fourth-highest single-season total in school history) to move into second place on the Mules all-time list (158).

Watkins, who was named a second-team midfielder, scored 12 goals on the season, including two in Muhlenbergs upset of nationally ranked Gettysburg. He tied for the team lead with seven assists and finished third on the squad with 19 points. Watkins (bottom left) ranks in the top 15 in Mule history in points (t-13th, 51), goals (14th, 35) and assists (12th, 16).

The four selections are the most ever for the Mules, who had three players named All-CC in 2006 and 2008.

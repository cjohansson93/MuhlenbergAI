Alumni Involvement

Alumni involvement is a critical component of the success of active chapters. Volunteer alumni boards provide current members with assistance in managing the affairs of the organization, raise funds for scholarships and grants, organize alumni activities, and serve as mentors and role models. All recognized chapters are required by the College to have an alumni board that meets regularly with chapter leadership.Listed below are the names of current alumni board chairpeople or the chapter advisor. If you are an alumnus/alumna of one of the currently recognized chapters and would be interested in assisting the chapter, please contact the Office of Student Engagement and we will put you in touch with the appropriate individual.

Kyra Hickey â21 has been named a 2020-2021 Newman Civic Fellowâone of just 290 students nationwideâby Campus Compact, a Boston-based non-profit organization working to advance the public purposes of higher education. The Newman Civic Fellowship is a yearlong program for students from Campus Compact member institutions. 
A dance and Italian double major and women's & gender studies minor, Hickey was nominated by Muhlenberg President Kathleen Harring on the basis of her potential for public leadership.
In her statement for the fellowship, Hickey wrote, âI believe in the transformative force of movement. Whether it's dance, sports, yoga or simply walking, movement enhances our inter- and intrapersonal connections. Access to regular physical activity and movement practice drives my work in community. I conceptualize access to activity as tied to food security and body positivityâ¦.Nurturing young people and their wellness is a responsibility and a public priority if we hope for a brighter, more inclusive future.â
During the course of the fellowship, Campus Compact provides the students with a variety of learning and networking opportunities that emphasize personal, professional and civic growth. Each year, Fellows are invited to a national conference of Newman Civic Fellows and participate in numerous virtual training and networking opportunities. The fellowship also provides recipients with pathways to apply for exclusive scholarship and post-graduate opportunities. 
âFor more than three years, Kyra has collaborated with three different groups of children within two local elementary schools and on-campus on a weekly basis, while exploring structural barriers to equity,â wrote Harring in her nomination of Hickey. âShe is committed to exploring issues of body positivity, food security and access to holistic education, and she feels passionately about building spaces where people can feel strength within their own bodies despite societal pressures and social circumstances.â
The fellowship is named for the late Frank Newman, one of Campus Compactâs founders, who was a tireless advocate for civic engagement in higher education. In the spirit of Newmanâs leadership, Campus Compact member presidents and chancellors may nominate one student from their institution for the fellowship.
âWe are proud to recognize each of these extraordinary student leaders and thrilled to have the opportunity to engage with them,â said Campus Compact President Andrew Seligsohn. âThe stories of this year's Newman Civic Fellows make clear that they are committed to finding solutions to pressing problems in their communities and beyond. That is what Campus Compact is about, and it's what our country and our world desperately need.â
The Newman Civic Fellowship is supported by the KPMG Foundation and Newmanâs Own Foundation.

cross country teams in top 5




The Muhlenberg cross country teams both finished in the top five at the DeSales Invitational, their last invitational meet before the Centennial Conference
Championships.

The Mules will compete in a 5K training run at Franklin & Marshall, the site of the CC meet, next week.

The Muhlenberg women finished third out of 23 complete teams, behind only squads from Minnesota and Virginia. Senior Sara Gearin (right) came in fourth for
the first top-five finish of her career. Her previous best in a regulation-length race was seventh at the Lehigh Valley Championships earlier this season. Freshman
Abby Simons also placed in the top 20 of the 203-runner field, coming in 17th.

The men might have won the event for the second year in a row, but they held out one of their top two runners. The Mules were fourth, 15 points behind the first-place
team. Junior David Chorney led Muhlenberg with a sixth-place finish, with sophomore 
Patrick Thornton (16th) and freshman Adam Kingsbury (left) (19th) also placing in the
top 20.

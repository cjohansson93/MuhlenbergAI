Digital Learning & Writing Centers





Digital Learning Center
The Digital Learning Center, also known as The Hive, can be found on B-Level directly across from the elevator. This center is the newest addition to the library and houses both the Digital Learning Team and Digital Learning Assistants. The Digital Learning Team helps open doors to digital learning and scholarship in the liberal arts. Their initiatives explore the uses of technology as resources for cultivating student voice and agency in their learning, fostering rich and meaningful interaction, and amplifying the integrative, authentic learning that we value as a liberal arts college.
Digital Learning Assistants (DLAs) offer the advanced knowledge of the digital tools that faculty most use in their courses, including:

Mediamaking and Digital Storytelling
ePortfolios/Domains/Web Publishing
Mapping and GIS
Digital Archives and âInformation Visualization

DLAs are available to work closely with students to offer guidance on digital learning projects or assignments.  Students are always welcome to stop into The Hive to meet with a DLA at any of the available times listed on the drop-in schedule.
Writing Center
The Writing Center can be found on A-Level of Trexler Library in the Writing and Information Consultation Center (WICC). This resource is affiliated with Muhlenbergâs Writing Program and functions independently of Trexler Library. The Writing Center is staffed by student writing tutors that provide assistance with studentsâ papers, either by appointment or during drop-in hours. Please visit the Writing Center website for full details about the Center.

Spring 2021 Updates to Faculty Resources



Library Home|Faculty Resources|Teaching and Learning







Trexler Library is eager to continue to support you and your students as you prepare for spring courses, both online and in-person. The following information highlights procedural updates and information relevant to the current teaching and learning environment.  These changes take priority over existing documentation.

Course Reserves Updated Procedures for Spring 2021
Librarian Consultations
Requesting Library Purchases for Spring 2021
Contactless Checkout for Library Materials
Interlibrary Loan Spring 2021

Collection Resources Online
Currently available: Over 1.7 million eBooks, eJournals, eVideos, eMusic, articles, databases and more are immediately findable and accessible through Encompass and Databases A-Z. In Encompass, you can narrow search results to any of the above e-format types, by using the Format filters on the left side of the search results screen (examples). 
Resources with COVID-19 free temporary access have been removed; one exception - all JSTOR archive journals are freely available until June 30, 2021. 
In addition to the above, we call your attention to the following:

Streaming videos: Through Alexander Street, the library provides unlimited subscription access to over 70,000 videos across most of our disciplines. Content types range widely and include instructional videos, fiction, documentaries, news and event recordings, and more. Through other publishers and platforms streaming access is purchased for a limited term on a title-by-title basis. 

Submit requests using the purchase request form and include the course number. 
See the Streaming Film Services document for additional guidance for streaming requests.

Textbooks: As a general policy the library does not purchase textbooks, however we have acquired some as part of ebook package purchases. These are cataloged and findable in Encompass along with catalogued Open Access textbooks. This subject guide provides sources for finding Open Educational Resources. 
Linking to library resources from within Canvas: View this short video for guidance. As always, when using online library resources in your course, it is best to link to the document or resource rather than downloading. This assures compliance with license terms and communicates use of these resources to the libraryâs collection development team. For assistance with linking, please email trexlerreserves@muhlenberg.edu or libraryresources@muhlenberg.edu.

Course Reserves
We will be continuing the COVID-19 best practices adopted for the fall semester by focusing on electronic reserves (physical reserves will be temporarily unavailable for this semester). We will still need our minimum 5-7 day notice requirement; given that we will be working remotely part of the time, this will give us the time needed to explore purchasing digital or streaming options as well as making copies available to you in Canvas. Articles, e-books/e-book chapters, and links to library resources may also be placed on course reserve within Canvas. After identifying a resource, simply fill out our Course Reserves Request Form with the desired links included. 
Feature & Drama Film Reserves Practices
We request 5 to 7 days advance notice to allow staff time to provide you with streaming access that meets legal requirements. This involves:
Exploring and purchasing streaming options for feature/dramatic or documentary films (or transcoding up to 25 percent without permission, per the TEACH Act, per our College attorney) or exploring other means of access.
To submit a reserves request, please use the online course reserves request form. 
For e-reserves questions, contact Amanda Riegel (trexlerreserves@muhlenberg.edu). 
For copyright questions, contact Kelly Cannon (kellycannon@muhlenberg.edu).
Librarian Consultations
Trexler Libraryâs librarians will continue to be available for consultations about classes, assignments, resources, and student support. They can be reached by email or phone. Contact information can be found on the Off-Campus Research Support page.
Requesting Library Purchases
Funds are available to purchase new ebooks and streaming films for courses taught this academic year. There will not be separate departmental allocations and requests can be submitted directly to your librarian liaison*. Submit requests as soon as possible: online resources can take more time to research, acquire, and set up. Purchase requests should include the course number and be emailed directly to your librarian liaison* or submitted through the online Suggest a Purchase form. All long-term purchase requests (not for use in Spring) may be submitted to your departmental or interdisciplinary liaison, as appropriate for the request. These requests should be held by the liaison for future submission. 
More information is available on the Collection Development page. See the Streaming Film Services document for additional guidance for streaming films. 
*Librarian liaisons: 
Sciences - Rachel Hamelers; Social Sciences - Jess Denke; Humanities, Business, GCE - Kelly Cannon; Art - Tina Hertel; Interdisciplinary Programs - Penny Lochner
Contactless Checkout of Trexler Libraryâs Physical Materials
To access Trexler Libraryâs print and audiovisual resources, please review our Contactless Checkout Service. This service maximizes access to physical collections while enhancing safety for patrons and library staff.
Interlibrary Loan
Trexler Library is still filling all interlibrary loan requests (books and articles) as normal. As some libraries are still not loaning books, it may take more time to receive book requests or we may be unable to receive a book request.If you have an Interlibrary loan book coming due, please email illd@muhlenberg.edu to request a renewal or return it using the library Book Drop. If you are not on campus, you may email illd@muhlenberg.edu to request a postage-paid return UPS label.  You will need to package the book(s) in a padded envelope or box and drop off the box at your local UPS Store.

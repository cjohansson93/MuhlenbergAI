daniels named player of the week



Men’s Golf Third at Swarthmore


The cold and rain were not a problem for Eric Boskey of the Muhlenberg men's golf team. The senior shot a 3-over-par 74 to place second at the Swarthmore Fall Invitational.

The Mules finished third out of 14 complete teams, three strokes behind Cabrini, the top Division III team on the leaderboard.

Boskey was one of only three Division III golfers to break 80 in the tough conditions. The medalist was a golfer from the University of Pennsylvania, which was not competing for a team score.

Senior Jason Daniels of the Muhlenberg men's soccer team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Daniels led the Mules to road ties at 2009 CC finalists Dickinson and Johns Hopkins in a four-day span. Muhlenberg was outshot by a 2-to-1 margin in the 
two games, but Daniels made 22 saves while allowing only one goal in 220 minutes. He recorded double figures in saves in both games, including a high of 
12 vs. Dickinson, after entering the week with a career high of 7 saves.

For the season, Daniels leads the CC with an .881 save percentage and is second with a 0.52 goals-against average.

The two ties put undefeated Muhlenberg (5-0-4 overall) into fourth place in the CC with a 1-0-3 record for 6 points. Swarthmore and Haverford (both 3-0-1)
are tied for first, with Dickinson in third place at 2-1-1.

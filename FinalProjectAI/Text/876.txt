Jewish Life on Campus

Muhlenberg offers Jewish students the outsize Jewish life of a large university in the intimate environment of a traditional Liberal Arts college. This combination is incredibly unique and itâs what makes Muhlenberg such a tremendous option for Jewish students and observant students. In addition, to the resources provided on campus, Muhlenberg benefits from being situated in the heart of Jewish Allentown, with the orthodox and Reform synagogues, JCC and Jewish Day School all in short walking distance.

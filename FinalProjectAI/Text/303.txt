As you update or review your existing course materials or campus publicity or in fact, as you begin to construct new materials, do consider reviewing this compiled list of resources related to accessibility and Universal Design for Learning.
Also, do feel welcome to refer to this spring 2019 TechTalk video for faculty and staff.
While preparing your course materials, there are some getting started best practices related to universal and inclusive design from the technical side.
We have documentation on tips and best practices related to images and graphics and related to audio and video practices too.

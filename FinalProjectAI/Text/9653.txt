Nick Fritz â15, the coordinator for peer-to-peer fundraising at Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), has worked on a range of projects, from a childâs charity lemonade stand all the way up to golf outings that bring in tens of thousands of dollars. But soon after a user launched a campaign called âRally for Reaganâ on CHOPâs fundraising portal this fall, Fritz realized this would be a memorable one.
âI was reaching out to Alexa (Keckler, the head volleyball coach) to get more information about this fundraiser, and when I looked at their page, I saw they were from Muhlenberg,â Fritz says. âI told her I was an alumnus and if thereâs anything you need at all, let me know.â
The Muhlenberg volleyball team had planned to raise money to fight breast cancer this October. But, in September, player Tara Register â20, a business and media & communication major, learned her 3-year-old cousin, Reagan, had Wilms tumor, a type of pediatric cancer that starts in the kidneys. Reaganâs tumor had gone undetected until it had grown to the size of a honeydew melon, causing other complications. As a result, she spent a month and a half in the intensive-care unit at CHOP before moving to its oncology center.
âWith Muhlenberg being just a little over an hour from CHOP, I was so happy that I could get to see Reagan several times during her stay in the hospital,â Tara says. âWe have a very supportive family that always jumps right in to help each other. Reagan is such a special kid. It was great that I could be there too.â
Meanwhile, Taraâs teammates shifted their fundraising focus to pediatric cancer. âOur team just stopped everything they were doing for breast cancer and said, âThis is where we need to put our attention,ââ Keckler says. They ordered shirts and wristbands to sell at their October 14 home matches against Gettysburg and Clarkson and worked with director of athletic communications Mike Falk to craft a program that would share Reaganâs story with fans. And, Fritz and Keckler got in touch.
âA lot of times weâll send a CHOP banner plus balloons and posters, so people know what theyâre raising money for,â Fritz says. âI was actually going back to Allentown that weekend to meet up with my parents, so I said Iâd drop by the College with the stuff. I knew Alexa was from Muhlenberg, so I was just trying to go that extra step to help them out.â
By the time October 14 rolled around, Reagan had been out of the ICU for a few days and was able to travel from her home in Ambler, Pa., to Muhlenberg. About 20 of her family members came, too, plus friends of Reaganâs parents and grandparents. âThere were a lot of little kids there,â Tara says. âShe hadnât been exposed to other kids running around for a while. It was a big deal for her to get a chance to run around again, and to meet all the volleyball girls.â
Between the efforts that day and the fundraising page thatâs still live, the team raised more than $7,000 for the oncology center at CHOP. âI was impressed with Rally for Reagan because they raised a lot of money in a short time,â Fritz says. âWhen I was first talking to Alexa, the page had been up for two weeks and theyâd already raised about $4,000. I was really impressed that such a small group could leverage the Muhlenberg community.â

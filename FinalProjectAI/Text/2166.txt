Lecture on U.S. military involvement in Middle East to take place Sept. 19 at Muhlenberg College


The Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics will host military historian Andrew Bacevich. His lecture, "America's War for the Greater Middle East", will take place at 7 p.m. in Moyer Hall's Miller Forum and will be followed by a book signing.


	 Friday, September 16, 2016  02:16 PM

The talk is based on Bacevich's new book, "America's War for the Greater Middle East," which chronicles and critiques U.S. military involvement in the Middle East dating to the Carter administration.
Bacevich is professor of international relations and history at Boston University; he previously taught at Johns Hopkins University and at West Point, where he graduated in 1969. Time calls him "one of the most provocative—as in thought-provoking—national-security writers out there today." His book, "Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country," is a blistering critique of the gulf between America's soldiers and the society that sends them off to war.
Bacevich also holds a Ph.D. in American diplomatic history from Princeton. With the U.S. Army, he served during the Vietnam War, and has held posts in Germany and the Persian Gulf; he retired, as a colonel, in the early 1990s.
The Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics' theme for the 2016-17 academic yearis "War & Peacebuilding." The Center for Ethics will host related programming, including lectures and a Campus Reads program, from September through November. All events are free and open to the public.
Subsequent fall Center for Ethics events include:
Woodrow Wilson Fellow David Frakt lecture, "Ethics, Politics and the Quest for Justice at Guantanamo: Reflections of a Gitmo Defense Lawyer"Sept. 27, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum
Renowned lawyer, human rights activist, military officer and scholar Frakt, the only defense counsel to successfully defend a detainee charged with war crimes before the Guantanamo military commissions, will reflect on this experience and discuss the broader ethical, legal, political and moral aspects of U.S. detention policies.
Eric Fair reading and discussion of "Consequences, a Memoir"Oct. 25, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hall’s Miller Forum
Fair, a Bethlehem native and resident, will do a reading and discussion from his book "Consequences, a Memoir," which chronicles Eric's role as a contract interrogator for the U.S. military during the Iraq War. It is a powerful exploration of moral injury and was heralded by Phil Klay, writer and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, as "An act of incredible bravery."
Campus Reads program on Pat Barker's novel, "Regeneration"Nov. 11, Common Hour, locations around campus
On Veteran's Day the Center for Ethics will mark centennial explorations of WWI by coordinating a campus reads program. CFE will invite faculty, staff and students to join in reading Pat Barker's novel, “Regeneration,” which explores complex issues around sanity, injury and war, and resonates well in the current moment. CFE will be asking people to sign up for the program by the end of September and will provide a free copy of the book for all participants. Participants will be assigned to groups and provided a location for meeting during Common Hour on Nov. 11 to discuss the novel. Prior to group discussions, coffee and refreshments will be available for participants in the Fireside Lounge of Seegers Union.
Through thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members.

Research Interests All behaviors can be generalized with a simple control loop, where sensory information is neurally processed to produce a motor output, which in turn produces actual behavior. I use insect models to investigate how processing of sensory information drives behavior. Animal behavior can impact ecological and evolutionary relationships, particularly in insect-plant systems. My research also explores the potential relationships between sensory processing and insect-plant interactions. I currently have three lines of investigation in my lab: 1. how natural flower motions are represented by descending visually-sensitive neurons in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, 2. the integration of visual and olfactory cues in bumblebee foraging, and 3. the impacts of non-pesticide agricultural pollutants on olfactory navigation in bumblebees.

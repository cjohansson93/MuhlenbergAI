 Fall 2002 | Spring 2003
September 11, 2001 has inspired a new wave of patriotic feeling and expression among Americans. We are witness to an increase in the display of America's symbols and a more spirited defense of American ideology. But at the same time that specifically American values and ideas are celebrated, the pressures and opportunities of globalism call to us. In this complicated international climate, American patriotism is both enacted and contested. The Center for Ethics invites us to study the nature, causes, and effects of this renewed emphasis on love of country through its Fall 2002 programming, The Boundaries of Home: Patriotism in a Global Era.
Through interactive programming, presentations, and classroom activities, the Center invites reflection on such questions as: What is it that one loves when one loves one's country? How does international cooperation and economic globalization change the meaning or enactment of patriotism? What do patriotic symbols signify? Is the new patriotism the same as the old patriotism? What is the relationship between patriotism and war? Is patriotism in conflict with a more universal humanism? What are American values? Is reflective patriotism possible? Is the concept of âbuy Americanâ outdated?
Programming will run from Tuesday, 17 September to Thursday, 26 September 2002. For its fundraising efforts this year, the Center for Ethics has chosen the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS). Students will be collecting for LIRS at most programmatic events, and attendance at some events(Student Rock Concert, Holly Hughes Performance) will require a nominal admittance fee that will go directly to LIRS.
OpeningReception and Dedication of Scott Sherk Sculpture Installation 17 September â¢ Galleria, Center for the Arts â¢ 7:00pm to 9:00pm The Center for Ethics has commissioned Professor Sherk to create a sculpture interpretation of the programmatic theme, to be erected in the GalleriaSpace of the Center for the Arts.

Forumon the American Flag 19 September â¢ Miller Forum, Moyer Hall â¢ 7:00pm to 9:00pm A round-table forum oriented around controversial issues related to the American flag.

What is the significance of flag burning as a means of protest (both domestically and abroad)? Are there improper ways of using the American flag as a symbol in works of art or consumer goods? Whatis the relationship of the US flag to those of multinational organizations of which the US is a part? Panelists will include performance artist Holly Hughes, and representatives from the ACLU, the Quaker church,citizen's organizations, and government.

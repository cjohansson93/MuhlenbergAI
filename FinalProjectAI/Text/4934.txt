Brookland Named Athlete of the Week



Sophomore Marc Brookland of the Muhlenberg men’s indoor track and field team was named athlete of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Brookland broke a 34-year-old school record in the triple jump at Susquehanna’s Orange & Maroon Classic. His leap of 45-3½  beat the previous mark of 44-5½ , set in 1976, by 10 inches. Brookland finished second by five centimeters and also placed eighth in the long jump.

Brookland has the second-best triple jump in the CC so far this year and needs to jump 11 inches further to hit the NCAA provisional mark.




Senior Samuel Hayden of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was named to the College Scholar All-East Region second team by the National Soccer Coaches Association
of America. The College Scholar All-Region squads were recognized at the recent NSCAA convention.

Hayden was picked from a pool that included all men’s players in Divisions II and III in an area that extends north to New Hampshire, west to Kentucky and south to Virginia.

Hayden previously was selected to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division second team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America
A double major in economics and Spanish, Hayden was a first-team All-Centennial Conference and second-team all-region center back for a Muhlenberg defense that allowed only 13 goals in 17 games and
ranked 28th in Division III in goals-against average. 

He started every game for the last three years, during which the Mules went 35-15-3 with 28 shutouts in 53 games. A three-time Centennial Conference player of the week and 
two-year captain, Hayden finished his career with totals of three goals and six assists.

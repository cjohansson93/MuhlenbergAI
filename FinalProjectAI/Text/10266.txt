Henry Giwa â21
Henry Giwa â21 learned about the Harvard Business Schoolâs Summer Venture in Management Program (SVMP) from a mentor heâs had since high school whoâd participated in it. Ordinarily, SVMP is a week-long educational experience held on Harvardâs campus for 160 students from groups that are underrepresented in business schools and in the corporate world.
COVID-19 necessitated moving the program to the virtual space, which allowed organizers to accept more studentsâabout 1,000âfor the 2020 Virtual Venture in Managementâ¯ (VVM) program. Of those, more than 700, including Giwa, are now part of a GroupMe chat in which participants swap knowledge and share information about scholarships and job opportunities for first-generation students and students of color.
âJust because things went virtual, itâs not taking away from the networking opportunities,â Giwa says. âIf anything, itâs making them stronger.â
Giwa, a finance major with minors in business administration and political science, attended the virtual sessions in June over his lunch break from his full-time, remote internship with Bank of Americaâs advisory development program. 
The organizer of both SVMP and VVM is the Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration Anita Elberse, whose expertise is in the business of entertainment, media and sports. Some of the sessions reflected that, such as Mondayâs case study of several marketing contracts offered to basketball player LeBron James early in his career and Fridayâs capstone session with special guests Russell Wilson, quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, and his wife, the singer Ciara. The midweek sessions brought in Harvard Business School alumni of color and SVMP alumni to discuss their experiences in business school and after it.
While Giwa isnât sure whether business school is in his futureâa bigger priority is obtaining his certified financial planner and chartered financial analyst certificationsâhe knows he wants to apply for SVMP when itâs offered in person next summer. More immediately, heâs planning to meet some of the New York City-area VVM participants he connected with on GroupMe in person.
âMy networks are very strong now,â Giwa says. âIâm continuing every day to connect with more students.â

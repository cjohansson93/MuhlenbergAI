Softball Bats Silenced by Moravian
 Thursday, April 12, 2012







					 



The high-powered offense of the Muhlenberg softball team, which had scored at least six runs in a school-record 13 consecutive games, was quieted by the pitching of Moravian.

The Mules (13-15) managed only six hits and one unearned run in dropping a doubleheader to the Greyhounds, 3-0 and 6-1. 

The losses tightened the Matte Award standings – Muhlenberg holds a 7-5 lead with four events (men’s and women’s track and field, men’s tennis and men’s golf) remaining.

Mule sophomore Kelly Kline extended her school-record hitting streak to 26 with a fourth-inning single in Game 1, but the streak was snapped in the nightcap. Moravian (21-7) pitched around Kline the whole game, walking her twice and hitting her once on a 3-0 pitch. In her final at-bat, she hit a soft liner back to the pitcher.

Freshman Kelsey Jones blanked the Greyhounds in six of seven innings in the opener but gave up three runs in the second for the only scoring of the game. Her personal four-game winning streak ended.

Junior Devon Barber (left) was the lone Muhlenberg player to have a hit in both games, and she also scored the Mules’ only run.

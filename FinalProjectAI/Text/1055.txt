Campus Community Message from President Harring
Thursday, March 5, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community, 
Iâm writing to update you on the Collegeâs response to the current global health situation. As of March 5, 2020, Muhlenberg College and the state of Pennsylvania do not have any confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). All current efforts of the College are preventative in nature to maintain the health and safety of our campus community and to protect our students, staff, faculty and visitors while ensuring continuity of operations.
During these times, many of you may have questions about COVID-19 and College policies. Please refer to the Collegeâs website for the most current information, policies and resources. 
We continue to work with our students whose study abroad programs have been interrupted because of the COVID-19 outbreak and travel restrictions. Those students are required to remain at home for 14 days of self-monitoring. After this time, they may visit the College for a particular event or in alignment with the short term College visitor policy, but cannot return to the College residentially or academically for the semester. 
In addition, following guidance from the World Health Organization and the CDC, Muhlenberg College has developed policies applicable to all members of the campus community. These policies are similar to those implemented at colleges and universities across the country.
General Policy
Any person who has traveled to or through a country with a Level 3 travel warning must notify the College and remain away from campus for 14 days from the date of departure from the affected area. During this time, you should monitor your health and maintain a daily log, twice daily recording your temperature and presence or absence of cough and shortness of breath. Following this 14-day period, students should contact Health Services and employees should contact Human Resources to schedule a phone appointment to review this information and determine your eligibility to return to campus. If you experience symptoms during the 14 days, you will need medical documentation clearing you to return to campus.  
Any other visitors and/or guests who plan to visit campus are asked to follow the same self-monitoring guidelines if they suspect they have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Travel Policy
The COVID-19 virus and information pertaining to travel are constantly evolving. We strongly encourage any individual traveling to personally review the current CDC recommendations and plan accordingly.   Effective immediately:

Level 3 International Travel: All College-sponsored travel to any Warning Level 3 countries is prohibited for the immediate future as we continue to monitor the situation and the progress of the outbreak. Currently, College-sponsored study abroad programs (short and long term) remain scheduled for summer and fall 2020. These programs will be reviewed on an individual basis by the Office of Global Education.
All other College-related International Travel: All future college-related international travel must be requested and approved by the Office of the Provost for faculty, Office of Human Resources for staff and the Office of the Dean of Students for students, using the form available here. If you already have travel plans in place you must complete the form so that we are aware of your travel plans.
College-related Domestic Travel: All college-related domestic travel must be registered with the Office of the Provost for faculty, Office of Human Resources for staff and the Office of the Dean of Students for students, using the form available here. If you already have travel plans in place you must complete the form so that we are aware of your travel plans.
Personal International or Domestic Travel: Any person with plans to travel to or through a Level 3 travel warning country MUST adhere to the Collegeâs general policies outlined above. For all other personal international travel, the College strongly encourages you to register your personal travel with the Office of the Provost for faculty, Office of Human Resources for staff and the Office of the Dean of Students for students, using the form available here.If you are returning to campus after having visited (for personal or college-related travel) an area in or outside of the United States in which a confirmed case of COVID-19 has occurred or where you have had potential exposure, please contact the Office of the Dean of Students (students) or the Office of Human Resources (employees). Depending on CDC, PA Department of Health, Allentown Health Bureau and other guidance for colleges and universities, you may be required to self-monitor away from campus for 14 days in accordance with the Collegeâs general policies.  

The health and safety of all members of our campus community is our top priority. We continue to monitor the situation and will keep the College community informed of any changes as they become available.  
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringInterim President

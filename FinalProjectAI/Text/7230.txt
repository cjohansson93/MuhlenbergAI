Track Teams Open Up Season at Kutztown
 Friday, January 17, 2014







					 





Lots of talent, months of hard work and a little bit of Luck combined to made a successful opening meet of the 2014 season for the Muhlenberg track and field teams.

The Luck was freshman Trevor Luck, who had perhaps the best performance of the night by finishing fifth in the high jump. His height of 6-2¾ is the best by a Mule since
2002 and ranks fourth on the all-time performance list.

Luck was one of several Muhlenberg athletes who made impressive debuts. A pair of freshmen landed in the top 10 on the performance list in the women’s pole vault: Claudia
Theriault (fifth) and Jacqueline Jones (tied for seventh). Jones also finished fifth in the triple jump.

Junior Cody Geyer, in his first meet with the Mule track team following an all-conference season in football, finished fifth with the eighth-best 55-meters time in program history.

Also blasting onto the performance list was junior Cora Wallace (left), who placed eighth in the shot put by improving her indoor best from last season by more than five feet.

Sophomore Claire Thornton posted Muhlenberg’s best finish of the meet, coming in second in the 1000 meters. Junior Kieran Newcomb and sophomore
Forrest Kentwell (right) placed third in the 800 and 1000, respectively.

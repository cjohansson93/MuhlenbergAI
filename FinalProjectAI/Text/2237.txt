Muhlenberg College postpones 40th season of Summer Music Theatre


	 Friday, March 20, 2020  00:55 PM


Allentown, Pa. (March 19, 2020) â Muhlenberg College announced today that it will postpone the 40th season of its Muhlenberg Summer Music Theatre festival until summer of 2021.
The season, scheduled to run June 11 through July 26, was to have featured "Legally Blonde," the world premiere of "The Legend of New York," and a new all-ages circus musical, "The Comedy of Wizards."
A celebration of the annual festival's 40th season, including an alumni cabaret and late-night show-tune karaoke, has also been postponed until next summer.
Directors had held auditions for this summer's productions, but had not yet finalized their casting decisions, according to Artistic Director Charles Richter.
"It was a difficult, heartbreaking decision, but we felt it was in everyone's best interest to make the call now, before our production process had gotten too far along," Richter says. ""I'm sure that many more of our patrons will be able to help us celebrate our 40th season next summer than would have been there this year."
Muhlenberg's Theatre & Dance Department produces the annual festival, which attracts more than 11,000 patrons and employs more than 150 artists, technicians, and administrators each summer.
The last three productions in the department's mainstage series have also been cancelled. At present, the Theatre & Dance Department is planning to resume public performances this fall.
No decision has been made about the lineup for the 2021 season. Richter says he's hoping to include some or all of the shows selected for 2020.
Patrons who hold tickets to the 2020 MSMT season will be contacted individually by the box office.

Baseball, Men's Lacrosse Slides Continue on Road

The Muhlenberg baseball and men’s lacrosse teams both had longer days than expected, and the days were made even longer when neither could pull out a win.

Baseball had a long day because the first game of its doubleheader at Franklin & Marshall went 12 innings. It was the longest Centennial Conference game ever for the Mules and their longest since a 13-inning affair against Scranton in 1991.

The Diplomats won the extra-inning contest, 7-6, and 



completed the sweep with a 6-1 victory in the nightcap. Muhlenberg (18-12, 2-6) has now lost four in a row.

F&M (16-12, 5-3) scored two runs off two Mule pitchers in the first inning of Game 1. Muhlenberg was able to stay in the game, however, due to the emergency long relief of freshman Matthew Lawsky, who came out of the bullpen for the first time in his career. Lawsky (right) allowed two runs in the third but gave up only an unearned run through the middle innings, striking out five in his six-inning relief stint.

Trailing 5-2, the Mules scored four runs in the top of the seventh to take their first lead of the day, the big hit a two-out, two-run triple by freshman Chris Manfredonia. F&M tied the score in the bottom of the inning.

Muhlenberg put the potential go-ahead run in scoring position in the eighth and ninth but could not score. The Diplomats got a leadoff double in the bottom of the ninth, but junior Ryan Rechten got a big strikeout to keep the game tied.

Neither team threatened in the 10th or 11th, and F&M finally won it on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 12th.

Junior Joseph Vila and senior Nick Busillo each had three hits in the game.

The nightcap was 1-1 until F&M scored one in the seventh and four in the eighth. Freshman Jimmy Cody drove in the lone Mule run with a double.

Men’s lacrosse had a long day because of confusion over the start time of the game. Muhlenberg and McDaniel were ready to go at 1:00, but the referees had a different schedule and did not show up until around 4:30.

Once the game got going, the Green Terror scored four third-quarter goals and held on to hand the Mules their eighth straight loss, 10-8.
 
Muhlenberg (2-9, 0-5) overcame an early 4-1 deficit to take a 5-4 lead with two goals in the last minute of the first half. One was the first career score for senior Jonathan Fritog (left), who also had an assist in the game.

McDaniel (6-6, 2-3) regained the lead with its four-goal third and held a 10-6 advantage before the Mules scored a pair of late goals.

Senior Nick Rispoli went 9-for-15 on faceoffs to move into second place on the program’s all-time list with 195 career faceoffs won.

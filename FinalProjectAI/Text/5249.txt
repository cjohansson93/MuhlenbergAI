WOMEN’S LACROSSE Gettysburg 15, Muhlenberg 8. The Mules trailed No. 6 Gettysburg only 6-5 after junior Amanda McGovern scored 2:17 into the
second half, but the Bullets ran off the next nine goals to pull away. It was a far cry from last year, when Gettysburg held a 13-3 lead at halftime. Sophomore
Allisyn Vachon helped keep Muhlenberg in the game by making a career-high 16 saves. McGovern scored three goals for her third hat trick in as many games this season.

against Washington), and senior Dan Dugan was 7-for-11 on faceoffs.

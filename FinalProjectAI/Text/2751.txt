conti named to district academic team



Christian Conti hits home runs in the classroom too.

The junior outfielder on the Muhlenberg baseball team was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division second team, as selected by the College
Sports Information Directors of America. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.2 cumulative grade-point 
average and a starter or significant reserve on his team. 

A finance major and philosophy minor, Conti had one of the best seasons ever by a Mule baseball player, hitting .380 and setting school records for runs (49), triples (11),
home runs (11), RBI (60), extra-base hits (29) and total bases (116). The Centennial Conference player of the year led Division III in triples through games of May 4 and also
ranked 12th in RBI per game and 18th in slugging percentage (.817).

In his first full season as a starting player, Conti helped Muhlenberg more than double its win total from 2007 (20 vs. 9) and qualify for the CC playoffs for the first time
since 2003.

Defense, Rebounding Strengths for Men



The Muhlenberg mens basketball team is in the top 20 in Division III in two familiar statistical categories.

The Mules (5-3) are sixth in rebound margin (plus-11.9 per game) and 16th in field-goal percentage defense (.372). Last year, the Mules ended the season in almost those exact some positions: They were sixth in rebound margin and 19th in field-goal percentage defense.

Junior Spencer Liddic is the 16th-leading scorer in the country, averaging 22.0 points per game.



Take a look at the NCAA Division III polls and statistical rankings, and you would never know that the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team has played
the first part of the season without its starting point guard, the reigning Centennial Conference player of the year.

In the new D3hoops.com poll, the Mules (7-0) moved up two spots to No. 14.


And should they win at Montclair State on Saturday, they have a good chance to 



move up even more in the next poll, as two teams ranked just ahead of them (No. 11 Illinois
Wesleyan and No. 12 Carthage) lost on Monday night, after the voting. Muhlenberg is also No. 14 in the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association poll.

In the first set of statistical rankings for the 2010-11 season, Muhlenberg is in the top 20 in the country (out of 441 schools) in six team categories:

• assists per game - fourth (19.9)
• blocked shots per game - ninth (6.3)
• scoring offense - 14th (77.7 points per game)
• scoring margin - 15th (22.6 points per game)
• assist-to-turnover ratio - 15th (1.08)
• turnover margin - 18th (7.86 per game)
That doesn’t include the category in which the Mules are tied for first in Division III – winning percentage. Muhlenberg is one of 24 remaining
undefeated teams.

Individually, junior Alexandra Chili is 12th in points per game (21.0) and 14th in three-pointers per game (3.1).

For the second time in five months, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team made the Sweet 16.

In March, the Mules advanced to the round of 16 in the NCAA Division III Tournament. Today, they showed up at No. 16 on the Women’s Basketball Coaches 
Association (WBCA) Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll.

This award, given in NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and Junior College/Community College, recognizes teams throughout the nation that carry the 
highest grade point averages (GPA) for the entire season based on the nomination submitted by WBCA-member head coaches. Muhlenberg’s GPA was 3.435.



Only three other schools — Hope, St. Benedict and York — finished in the top 16 in both the NCAAs and the WBCA Academic Honor Roll.

This is the fourth time since 2004 that the Mules have been honored for their academic achievements by the WBCA. They finished 24th on the WBCA Academic Honor Roll
in 2004, 18th in 2005 and tied for ninth in 2006.

football opens atop lambert poll



The Muhlenberg football team is tied for first in the first ECAC Lambert Meadowlands Division III poll of the 2008 season.

The 5-0 Mules, who finished third in the Lambert poll last year, are tied with 5-0 Cortland State. Washington & Jefferson is third, followed by two teams, Delaware Valley
and Wesley, tied for fourth. Salisbury, Rensselaer, Ithaca, Trinity and St. John Fisher round out the top 10.

Established in 1936 as the Lambert Trophy to recognize supremacy in Eastern college football, the award has since grown to recognize the best team in the East in the Bowl
Subdivision. In 1957, the Lambert Cup was created to recognize non-Division I-A teams, and in 1966 a Division III award was added. The other first-place teams this week
at Penn State (Bowl Subdivision), James Madison (Championship Subdivision) and Bloomsburg (Division II).

In the national Division III polls, Muhlenberg is ranked fifth by both D3Football.com and the 
American Football Coaches Association.

The Mules also figure prominently in the NCAA statistical rankings, with two players in the top 10. Senior Eric Santagato is sixth in passing efficiency (181.07),
and junior Phil Cresta (right) is eighth in receiving yards per game (128.6). Junior John DeLuca is 15th in rushing yards per game (138.8).

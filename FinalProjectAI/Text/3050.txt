tennis courts get new look


Muhlenberg’s Kern Field tennis courts will have a different look when students return to campus next month. Instead of being all green, as they have been
since their construction in 2003, the courts will be painted in US Open colors – green and blue.

The first step in the process began today when workers applied the first of two layers of acrylic sealant – a fun job on a high-80s, high-humidity day. You can see
the steam rising from the ground in the picture on the left in the bottom row.

Check back for more pictures as the resurfacing project continues.

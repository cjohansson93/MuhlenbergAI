Wrestling


The Muhlenberg wrestling team finished ninth at the Centennial Conference Championships. Three of the four Mule wrestlers won at least one bout, with seniors
Kevin Homan (149) and John Sternlicht (184) each going 2-2 to finish fourth.

It was the third time placing at the CC Championships for Homan, who finished the season with a record of 30-9, posting the first 30-win season by a Mule
since 2009. Sternlicht, who placed third at 165 last year, lost a close 3-2 decision to the eventual champion in the semifinals.

The Muhlenberg baseball team went batty in its first games of the 2012 season.

The Mules pounded out 30 hits, 10 for extra bases including four home runs, in sweeping Gallaudet, 16-1 and 13-6.




Vila had a triple in the first game and finished the day with six RBI.



In scoring 16 runs in their opener, the Mules broke an 85-year-old school record, established when the 1927 squad began its season with a 15-5 win against Lehigh. The 1927 team also was the last to plate 29 runs in its first two games. 

But while the offense put up some eye-opening numbers, the most impressive performance may have come from junior Rob Shannon, who pitched a gem in the first game. The southpaw struck out nine and took a one-hit shutout into the seventh inning before a Bison player hit a leadoff home run.

Shannon gave up a single to the second batter, then started a 1-6-3 double play and faced the minimum batters through five innings. He struck out the side in the second and did not permit the ball to be hit out of the infield from the second through the sixth innings.

Muhlenberg’s offense got untracked with a five-run third inning. Freshman Jimmy Cody knocked in the first run with a double in his first career at-bat, and senior Nick Busillo’s two-run single capped the rally. 

Junior John Muha hit his second career home run, a two-run blast, in the fourth, and in the fifth, freshman Nick Plinio belted a two-run pinch-hit homer in his first career at-bat.

Sophomore Nick Kennedy added his first career home run in the sixth.

The Mules got outstanding production from their first basemen, as senior Brian Beck and sophomore Max Litvak, who split the game, combined to go 3-for-4 with two RBI.

The duo only got better in the nightcap, going 5-for-5 to lead a 17-hit attack. Muhlenberg scored at least two runs in five of the seven innings.

Junior Joseph Vila went 3-for-4 with four RBI, three coming on a first-inning home run, in the second game.

Junior Billy Rogers fanned six in four innings to earn his first career win.

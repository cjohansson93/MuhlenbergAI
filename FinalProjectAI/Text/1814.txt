Student Employment Slideshow (.pdf)


Trexler Library can be open up to 105 hours every week to provide the in-person and virtual services the Muhlenberg community needs. Employing students is the only way the Library can accomplish its mission. Our student assistants engage in various activities that range from helping patrons at the front Lending Services desk or working downstairs with particular collections. In addition to the benefits they provide to the library, students who work for Trexler gain firsthand knowledge of the collections and resources we have to offer, familiarity with technology often needed for academic success, and real-world experience that cannot be found in a standard classroom setting.


Departmental Opportunities
Trexler Library offers nearly 50 student employment opportunities during the fall and spring semesters, along with a handful of openings during the winter and summer months. These positions are scattered throughout the different library departments:

Administration
Collection Resource Management
Lending Services
Special Collections & Archives

Assigned duties greatly vary depending on which department a student works for. Administrative student assistants typically will focus on clerical work and book mending, whereas Collection Resource Management student employees will work on processing and labeling new acquisitions. Lending Services student assistants are some of the first staff members you see entering Trexler Library and are tasked with helping patrons find whatever information resources they need along with maintaining the bookshelvesâ order. Special Collections & Archives student employees are often tasked with digitizing materials, creating metadata for digital objects, and helping to research reference questions. Our employment opportunities are ideal for a wide variety of students.


Work Schedule & Compensation
Work schedules are set by the direct supervisor(s). Most departments have a set weekly schedule that is to be followed for the length of the semester. In these situations, student class/extracurricular schedules are greatly taken into consideration. However, some positions allow a flexible schedule depending on the studentâs availability that week. Student employees typically work 6 - 8 hours per week during the regular semester and closer to 30 hours per week during summers and breaks. Some positions follow typical workday hours while others require working evenings and weekends
Pay rates are set by the Collegeâs Financial Aid office or Human Resources department. Student employees are paid monthly during the fall and spring semesters and biweekly during the summer.


Application Process
Trexler Library welcomes all incoming as well as returning students to apply for library employment. Preference is given to those who have been previously employed at the Library. Most library positions are open only to students who have work-study as part of their Financial Aid package. If you are unsure if you have work-study, consult your Financial Aid Portal. To view all current Library student employment openings, please visit our  Handshake postings.


Contact Us
If you have any questions about working at Trexler Library in the future or would like more information, please contact our Administrative Assistant, Lindsay Liiro, at 484-664-3551 or lindsayliiro@muhlenberg.edu.

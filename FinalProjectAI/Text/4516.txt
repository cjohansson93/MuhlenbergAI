field hockey loses in finale



The Muhlenberg field hockey team closed out its 2010 season with a 4-0 road loss to Centennial Conference playoff-bound Gettysburg.

The Mules (2-14, 2-8) trailed by just one goal until the Bullets (9-8, 7-3) added a second score 15 minutes into the second half. Muhlenberg
called timeout and came back with its best offensive push of the game, taking four shots in a two-minute span. One required a defensive save by a
Gettysburg player and two others were saved, but none went in, and the Bullets went on to score twice in the final eight minutes to put the game out of reach.

Sophomore Kristen Dornenburg saw plenty of action for the second straight game, making 19 saves. After setting a school record with
26 stops against Ursinus on Tuesday, that gave her a school-record 45 saves in consecutive games. Dornenburg (right) ended the year with 158 saves,
good for third place on the Mules' single-season list and the most by a 'Berg keeper since 1996.

Junior Renee Norton made a defensive save.

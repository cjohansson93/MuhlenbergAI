faust receives weikert award





Faust accepts congratulations from Muhlenberg President Randy Helm as her parents and Nancy Weikert Tibbets, widow of Sidney Weikert, look on.



Junior Alex Faust of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team received the Sidney G. Weikert Sophomore Athlete of the Year Award for her performance 
during the 2007-08 academic year.

The annual award, presented during halftime of the Homecoming football game, recognizes athletic achievement with accompanying campus contribution and 
strong academic record. It was established in 1973 by the Muhlenberg College Alumni Association in memory of the late Sidney G. Weikert, a loyal alumnus and former 
associate director of admissions at Muhlenberg. 

In her first two years at Muhlenberg, Faust rewrote the record book in the pole vault. She holds the school and Centennial Conference records both indoors and 
outdoors in the pole vault and has won four gold medals in the event at conference meets. She provisionally qualified for NCAA Championships in the pole vault in 2008. 

Faust excels in other events as well. She won the Centennial Conference gold medal in the 400 meters in 2008 and holds schools records in the 200 meters, 
both indoors and outdoors. She was named Outstanding Performer for field events at the 2007 Indoor Championships.
 
A double major in dance and business administration, Faust also was named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll twice as a sophomore.

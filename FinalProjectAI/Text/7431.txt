DiMaio Shoots One Under at York
 Monday, March 24, 2014 - page 2







					 




Senior Chris DiMaio shot a career-low one-under-par 71 to tie for first place at the York
Spring Invitational, the first big tournament of the spring season for the Muhlenberg men’s golf team.

The Mules finished third out of 16 teams with a score of 306, matching their lowest of the last two years.



DiMaio (left), whose previous career best was 74, shot five birdies, including two back-to-back on the seventh and eighth holes. He is
the second Muhlenberg golfer to shoot a 71 this year, but he missed out on medalist honors on a match of cards with two other 
golfers who came in at one under on the 6,100-yard Out Door Country Club course.



Freshman David Barkley and sophomore Jonathan Graulich shot 79 apiece, one stroke ahead of senior
Christopher Lucarelli.

The Muhlenberg women’s golf team opened its spring season Saturday at the ambitiously named North American Women’s Collegiate
Golf Challenge, a four-team tournament hosted by Ursinus at Skippack Golf Club.

The Mules finished second, ahead of Centennial Conference foes Franklin & Marshall and Ursinus, despite missing one of their top players.

Junior Christina Bryde led Muhlenberg and finished fourth overall with an even 100.

Junior Laura Glogovsky (right) tied her career low round of 104, and senior Kristin Lang was a stroke behind.

The Muhlenberg women's tennis team moved up in the rankings and moved closer to a Centennial Conference playoff berth with an 8-1 win at Ursinus.

In the Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings released earlier in the day, the Mules were 12th in the Atlantic South Region, up three spots from their position in the previous rankings.

 In the CC standings, Muhlenberg (8-3, 6-2) is tied with Swarthmore for third place with two matches remaining - tomorrow at first-place Johns Hopkins and next Tuesday against Dickinson. A win in either of those matches should be enough to get the Mules in the five-team playoff field.

Against Ursinus, Muhlenberg won all six singles matches in straight sets and was just a 9-7 doubles loss away from its fifth shutout of the season. Seniors Caitie Druker, Sara Sutker and Danielle Winston all won at both doubles and singles, with Druker passing the 80-win mark for her career and Winston earning her 50th career doubles win.

Freshman Nina Sanders won 6-0, 6-1 at singles for the second straight match.

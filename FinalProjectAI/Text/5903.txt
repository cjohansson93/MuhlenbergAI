Volleyball Closes Out Season With Solid Showing
 Saturday, October 29, 2011 - page 3







					 





Price ranks fifth in school history in blocks and 12th in kills.



Because of a mold outbreak in its dorms, some students at St. Mary’s College in Maryland are soon going to be staying in a cruise ship docked next to the campus, which sits along the Chesapeake Bay.

In its final action of the 2011 season, the Muhlenberg volleyball team did a little crusing of its own at the St. Mary’s Seahawk Invitational. The Mules went 3-1 over the two days to reach double-digit wins for the year.

The tournament also marked the end of the careers for seniors Davi Gordon, Brooke McQueen and Jackie Price. And walking off the court one last time was very bittersweet, according to Gordon.

“There were definitely some tears, but I actually think the parents were crying more than we were,” Gordon said with a laugh. “It feels really weird that our careers are over, and hopefully the younger girls can keep up what we did this year.”

If the younger players play like they did against in Friday’s opening 3-1 win over Wesley, Muhlenberg should be in good hands next fall.

Freshman Holly Hynson led the way with 11 kills, while freshmen Lindsey Gambocurta and Alyssa Schell combined for 24 digs. Sophomore Morgan Duggan teamed with rookie Nikki Dickson to dish out 31 assists.

But in the nightcap against Bridgewater, Gordon showed that the seniors could still get it done. She compiled her first double-double of the season, racking up a career-high 17 kills to go along with 10 digs and seven blocks as the Mules beat the Eagles in four sets.




McQueen finished her career in the top 25 in school history with more than 550 career digs.


“The past four years have been a roller coaster, to say the least,” Gordon said. “From injuries and illness to playing with a lot of different players and for different coaches, it has not always been easy. But these have been the best four years of my life, and I will always be a part of ’Berg volleyball.”

After getting swept by Lynchburg in Saturday’s opener, Muhlenberg swept the City College of New York to close out its season with a win. 

Senior Jackie Price finished with 10 kills in the win over the Beavers. Classmate Brooke McQueen added 16 digs, and Gordon finished with 12 digs and eight kills.

The Mules added four wins to their total from last fall and finished .500 in the Centennial Conference. And even in some of its loses Muhlenberg showed marked improvement, pushing two teams that finished in the top three in the CC to five sets.

“It feels so great to get to 10 wins,” Gordon said. “We obviously struggled last year, so this was a big accomplishment. And I can’t wait to see what the younger girls can do to improve even more next year.”

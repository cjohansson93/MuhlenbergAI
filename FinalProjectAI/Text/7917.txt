Men's Soccer Lances Devils Again to Advance to Final

Lances were weapons used by warriors mounted on horses to combat enemies in Medieval times. In the modern day,
the Lance can be used with a group of Mules to fight off Devils.

Senior Lance Dotzman scored the lone goal of the game off a second-half corner kick as the 
Muhlenberg men’s soccer team advanced to the Centennial Conference championship game with a
2-1 win against Dickinson. 

Ten days ago, the Mules defeated the Red Devils, 2-1, and in the two games Dotzman scored all three goals,
all in the final 20 minutes.

Muhlenberg (13-1-2) will face Haverford, which stunned top-seeded and previously undefeated Franklin &
Marshall in the other semifinal, as it tries to win its first title since 2005. 

In the first meeting between the two regionally ranked teams, Dickinson had a 16-7 advantage in shots
and enjoyed the better of play for the majority of the game. It was the other way around in the rematch,
with Muhlenberg taking 11 shots to just five for the Red Devils (11-5-2).

“Our team never let up and we had no mental lapses,” said senior Danny Pinto,
who recorded his 10th career shutout. “We were the dangerous team throughout, and they never 
were able to get any real pressure on us.”


The game was scoreless when the Mules lined up for a corner kick with about 17 minutes to play. Senior
Joey Roberts flicked the kick,
and the ball came to junior Tommy Hoffmann, who passed it back to Dotzman near the
penalty spot.

Dotzman drove a clean shot into the upper-right corner for his team-leading 11th goal of the season.

“We had a lot of good chances early on and felt good about how we were playing,” said
Dotzman. “We all had hope and knew we could find that goal, and it felt good to get it.”

That was all the Mules would need, as the starting backs – Hoffmann, seniors Bryan Attanasio (left),
Oliver Katz and Joe Adams and freshman Jan Chmura –
held Dickinson, the highest-scoring team in the CC, to one shot on goal.

“Everyone did a great job of keeping their shape,” said Pinto. “My center backs 
played a great game, and the midfielders did very well with possession. We all have such great 
chemistry, and it especially shows in these big games.”

Muhlenberg has another big game tomorrow against a Haverford team that will be playing in its third
final in four years. The Fords (11-6-1) needed a game-tying goal with two seconds left in their
regular-season finale against Swarthmore to make the playoffs and are now just one win away from
the championship. In the first meeting between the two teams, the Mules scored three late goals to
come back for a 4-3 win.

“We need to feed off this energy and play Haverford like we have played the other great teams 
in our conference,” said Pinto. “Anything can happen in the playoffs and we are looking 
forward to the opportunity to bring home a conference title.”

DMR, Carnevale Excel in Final Track Warmup
 Friday, February 15, 2013







					 


If their last warmup meet is any indication, the Muhlenberg track and field teams are more than ready for next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships.




Senior Jim Gamrat was one of three Mules to finish in the top six in the shot put.



The Mules had 13 top-three performances, one school record and one of the top times in Division III this season at Haverford’s Keogh Invitational.




Daniells also placed sixth in the 200 meters.



The performance of the night came from the women’s distance medley relay team of seniors Erica Bash, Lexie Daniells and Samantha Mayden and junior Nicki Cronin. The quartet crossed the finish line in 12:09.20, the top time in program history on a flat track. Entering the weekend, there had been only seven faster DMRs in Division III. Mayden took the baton for the final leg in third place, well behind the front-running Haverford team, and split 4:58 in the mile to win by more than a half-second.

That was one of three first-place finishes for Muhlenberg, and the other two came from junior Stephanie Carnevale, who captured both the 60 meters and the 60-meter hurdles. Carnevale’s time of 8.17 in the dash broke an eight-year-old school record by more than a tenth of a second.

Sophomore Kirsten Kuchera (200), junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski (60 hurdles), senior Colette Faust (high jump) and freshman Ashley Riley 
all logged second-place finishes, as did the 4x200 relay team (Kuchera, Tara Keegan, Francesca Aldrich and Nicole Pisani). Riley set a personal record by more than nine inches and climbed to fourth on Muhlenberg’s all-time performance list.

Senior Isaiah Vaughn (60 meters), freshman Rami Hamdan (shot put) and senior Ryan Hellings (pole vault) all came in third on the men’s side. The 4x200 relay team (Vaughn, Andrew Onimus, Jeffrey Phillips, Keenan Mease) also placed third, missing an ECAC-qualifying time by less than a second.

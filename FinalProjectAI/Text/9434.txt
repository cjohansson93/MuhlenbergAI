Shana Joseph â18 is helping to build a whole new worldâliterallyâas a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Entertainment Technology Center. This semester, sheâs working on improving transitions in virtual-reality games.
âIn VR, cuts are used but also avoided,â says Joseph, explaining that moving from one location to another can be confusing for players. âMy team and I are working on how to create cinematic cuts for storytelling purposes,â which could improve the gaming experience and allow designers to have more flexibility. She hopes to eventually work in the game or film industry, possibly as a technical artist.
From almost the beginning of her first year at Muhlenberg, Joseph knew that she wanted to study computer science. However, it wasnât until the photography course she took a year later that she fell in love with art. âI really enjoyed it. I especially liked going from my computer science classes to photography classes,â she says; the two worked her brain in differentâand invigoratingâways. When the semester ended, Art Professor Joe Elliott encouraged Joseph to enroll in another class. By the spring of her sophomore year, sheâd declared a double major in computer science and studio art.
Joseph says her professors gave her solid foundations in both art and programming and helped her find a study abroad program in New South Wales, Australia, which offered some technical art classes Muhlenberg didnât. Going to a small college had other advantages, says Joseph: âI was able to try new things,â like joining a dance group and running track at the collegiate level.
âWhen I first came [to Carnegie Mellon], I was really scared and nervous,â Joseph recalls. However, she quickly realized that Muhlenberg had given her the skills to thriveâand that the network sheâd built there had her back. Elliott kept in touch while she navigated the graduate school admissions process, and now, Joseph is helping a current Muhlenberg student who also hopes to work in entertainment technology. âI had a great experience, mostly because of the people I met, and I'm still in contact with so many of them,â she says.

Printing for Students

Papercut is available to all students for printing! This is the same solution used by faculty and staff across campus since 2018. 
Printing quota: Students will start each semester with $50 of printing. The $50 allocation is the same for all students. Rates for printing are as follows:
$.06 per sheet for black and white printing$.16 per sheet for color printingPlease note that the $50 allocation is equivalent to:
833 sheets in black and white, OR312 sheets in color, ORany combination thereofRemember, single-sided and double-sided sheets have the same rates, so everyone is encouraged to always print double-sided.
A one time per semester print increase can be requested. If approved, an addition $33 will be added to the student's account (approx 550 black and white pages). If you need a print increase, please submit a print quota increase form.  
Checking your print balanceTo check your print balance, visit the PaperCut website and enter your username and password. Note: This website is only available on the campus network. 
Check out the printing help guides to find out how to print to Papercut on your device or from a lab. 
After your device is set up to print, you can send a print job! Stop by any of the new Ricoh devices in the locations at the top of this page, tap your card on the printerâs card reader and your prints will be released. Itâs that easy. 
In addition to printing, you can take advantage of new features like Scan to Email and Copy.

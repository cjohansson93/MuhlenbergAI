Muhlenberg College is offering “Brain Camp,” a summer science camp called geared towards motivated, energetic high school students who are interested in studying the inner-workings of the nervous system. Held on July 10-15, 2005, students will explore the inner workings of the central nervous system through hands-on laboratory experiences.  
Brain Camp is a residential camp for high school students who will be beginning their junior or senior year in fall 2005.  Tuition and all living expenses are provided free to each student.  Students will live in supervised student housing on the Muhlenberg College campus. All meals and social activities are included.  The funding for this camp is provided by a grant from the federal government (FIPSE).

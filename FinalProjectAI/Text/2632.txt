women’s hoops wins third straight





Bates, who came into the game 1-for-11 from three-point range on the season, hit back-to-back threes in the second half, extending the Mule lead from 50-46 to 56-46.



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team went into its Centennial Conference home game against Franklin & Marshall hoping to use its size advantage to dominate the boards. 
Little did the Mules know that the smallest player on the court would be responsible for their rebounding margin.

Five-foot-4 freshman point guard Kelly McKeon recorded 11 points, six assists and, surprisingly, 10 rebounds in her first career start to spark Muhlenberg to its third straight win, 72-59.

“It’s exciting [to have McKeon in the starting lineup],” said junior Erin McSherry, whose season-high 12 boards helped the Mules to a 41-31 rebounding edge. “She’s a great point guard. She knows what she’s doing, and we have complete confidence in her as a team.”

McKeon had two rebounds, two steals, two points and an assist in the first 6:30 as Muhlenberg (4-2, 2-1) jumped out to a 13-2 lead against the Diplomats, the second straight team to come into Memorial Hall 4-0 and leave with their first loss. The Mules stretched their lead to 29-13 with 2:40 left in the first half before F&M found its rhythm.

An 8-2 run to close out the half cut the margin to 10, and the Diplomats – who overcame an 18-point deficit in the last 9:26 to defeat Johns Hopkins in their last 
game – eventually shaved the lead to two points, at 46-44, with 8:37 left. Back-to-back baskets by junior Lauren Boyle, the first off an offensive rebound and the second off an inbounds pass from McKeon, kicked off a 17-2 run that put the game out of reach.

Boyle made her first five shots from the field and ended up with 20 points, her third straight game with 20 or more points. Sophomore Alexis Bates went 
4-for-4 from the field in the second half to finish with 15 points, and sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley scored 11 to go along with four assists.

The win completed a week in which Muhlenberg won three games in five days, erasing memories of a disappointing loss to Gettysburg the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.

“We’ve been going harder and harder in practice since that loss and playing better every day,” said McSherry. “It’s a total turnaround in team morale.”

A series of programs, available to the Muhlenberg community and the general public, explore historic and current individuals central to Black liberation movements.

The two-part "Blackness, Disability and Our Current Moment" examines the intersections of Blackness and disability in contemporary society. The events will center the experiences of the communities who live at those intersections and their countless contributions to Black liberation movements, including those of our current moment.
The closing event, "Black Excellence: Lifting Our Voices in Solidarity," brings together voices from Muhlenberg College students, faculty and staff with community leaders and experts in diversity and inclusion. The event keynote will be delivered by activist Amanda Hikes, chief equity and inclusion officer for the American Civil Liberties Union and the executive director of the Office of LGBT Affairs for the City of Philadelphia.
The series of events are sponsored or developed by the Muhlenberg College Africana Studies Program, the Office of Multicultural Life and the Black Students Association.

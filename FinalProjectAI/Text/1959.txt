MOL 510 Human Resource Leadership Strategy (required for this concentration)
The people of an organization are very often its strongest and best source of performance and competitive advantage. This course emphasizes the strategic importance of human resources in organizational action, with an overview of the objectives, requirements, economics, opportunities, and processes of creating the best workforce for long phases of an organizationâs life.

This course is essential for anyone who wishes to be an effective employer, manager, HR professional, or anyone looking for an understanding of the laws that drive employment policies.
MOL 516 International Human Resources Leadership
Every element of HR management becomes more complex across international borders. Advances in technology and changing demographics in our workforce make talent readily accessible across boundaries. With global markets for products, services, and workers, organizational leaders need to know how to adapt to international HR realities. The ability to recognize and adapt to differences in work culture and expectations, human resource and workersâ rights issues, immigration policies, and social norms affect both the expatriateâs experience, and also the ability to welcome global workers into an organization. To develop effective global HR management practices for leaders to use, this course combines best practices and learning from management techniques of international businesses and NGOs
MOL 520 Communications Leadership Strategy (required for this concentration)

Organization leaders routinely must convey important information to internal audiences of coworkers, executives, and governance officials. These audiences require distinct communications methods and techniques. This course explores the various roles of internal communication in times of organizational stability and change.

Students in this course analyze the opportunities that diversity brings to the workplace and related issues of ethnocentrism and prejudice, and prepare to succeed in diverse settings using reflection, simulations, and community practice.
MOL 632 Organizational Change Management        
Organizations are in constant flux, and leaders need to prepare for change in the organization in response to market, political, economic, social, and other forces, both internal and external. Students use a systems view to examine what drives people to change, how change methods affect people and desired outcomes, misconceptions about change methods, financial impact of change methods, and common elements across methods.

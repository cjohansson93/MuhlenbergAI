	 Thursday, September 9, 2010  11:45 AM

This event is free and open to the public.
The Book of Salt was a national bestseller and the recipient of the New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award, the Bard Fiction Prize, a PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles National Literary Award,  In 2003, The Book of Salt was honored as a New York Times Notable Fiction Book, among other citations.
Troung’s appearance is a part of Living Writers, a semester-long series of public readings. Future readings will be given by Matthea Harvey, Russell Banks, Sarah Vowell, Art Spiegelman and Alan Michael Parker.
Established in 1994, “Living Writers” is a course offered once every three years which brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening. Each writer is interviewed on the college’s radio station. Their visit is a community event. Past participants have included David Sedaris, Jonathan Franzen, Gary Snyder, Adrienne Rich, Francine Prose, Galway Kinnell, Robert Pinsky, Michael Ondaatje and Phillip Levine.

men’s soccer earns regional ranking


 
The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team appears in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America regional poll for the first time in 2009. The Mules are tied
for eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region:

1. Messiah (6-0)
2. Swarthmore (6-0)
3. Dickinson (6-0)
4. Elizabethtown (7-0)
5. Scranton (6-1)
6. Johns Hopkins (6-2)
7. Cabrini (6-2)
8t. MUHLENBERG (4-2)
8t. DeSales (5-2)
10. Gettysburg (3-1-2)
The Mules, who have won three in a row by a combined score of 13-0, will have their work cut out for them in the upcoming weeks. Their next four matches are against
other regionally ranked teams, starting at Gettysburg on Saturday, followed by home matches against Dickinson, Johns Hopkins and DeSales.

Muhlenberg’s two losses are to 6-0-1 Montclair State, ranked third in the South Atlantic and 17th in Division III, and 6-1 Richard Stockton, ranked fifth in
the South Atlantic. 

The Mules have earned a regional ranking every year since at least 1988.

The Muhlenberg women, though not ranked in the region, have a similar resume as the men: They are also 4-2, both of their losses are to ranked teams (Messiah, No. 1 in
the country, and Oneonta State, No. 7 in the East Region), and they have a slew of tough games coming up. The Mules travel to Scranton (eighth in the region) on Saturday
and Haverford (10th in the region) next Wednesday before returning to Varsity Field for a Homecoming matchup with Dickinson (fourth in the region) next Saturday.

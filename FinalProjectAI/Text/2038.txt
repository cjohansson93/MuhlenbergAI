WHAT IS FIELD STUDY?
 
In the world of science, there are two main components: gathering information and hands-on experimentation. While prepartaion for field study requires extensive background research in order to develop your methods, the emphasis is on hands-on experimentation. The main goal of field study is to actually take your work out into the real world and perform your experiments there.
The NSF team at Muhlenberg College has been able to take field study to a whole new level. While students research independently throughout the year, summer is the height of field research. Students spend 10 weeks doing full time research using two field sites, Raker Biological Field Station and Graver Arboretum.

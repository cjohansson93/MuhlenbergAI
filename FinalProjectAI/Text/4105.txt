Women’s Tennis Season Ends in CC Semis


The 2011 season came to an end for the Muhlenberg women's tennis team with a 5-0 loss to Johns Hopkins in the semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Blue Jays, ranked ninth in Division III, swept the doubles and had big leads in all the singles matches when decision was reached. They advance to face
Washington, a 5-1 winner over Swarthmore, in the final.

The Mules close their season with a record of 10-6.

The Muhlenberg men's golf team is leading after one day of the Centennial Conference Championships.

The Mules, seeking their first title since 2004, led by seven strokes over Gettysburg after the first 18 holes. They shot a 307 in the first round, three strokes
better than they shot in any of the three rounds last year, when the CC Championships were first held at Stonewall. 

The rest of the CC began to creep up on Muhlenberg in the first nine holes of Round 2. Only nine strokes separate first from fifth place, with the Mules' margin
over Gettysburg now just a single stroke.

Senior Jordan Carpenter (left) shot a 76 in the first round and is two-over 37 through the first half of the second round. 

The tournament concludes with 27 holes on Sunday.

"Media Framing and Public Understanding of Sexual Assaultâ
This study examines how media framing in news media can   influence media consumer thoughts and attitudes in regards   to reports about sexual assault. The media frames that were   examined and analyzed were: (1) prevalence of     victim blaming, (2) the role of alcohol as a main cause of    sexual assault, (3) the role of social media in sexual assault   cases, and (4) the placement of the content in newspapers.   This study specifically analyzed two news reports about the   2013 Steubenville, OH rape case and readersâ thoughts about   causes of the assault after reading the provided news articles.  The results are analyzed and discussed in relation to how    they can be used to encourage media producers to be more   aware of how news media is received and understood by the   public.

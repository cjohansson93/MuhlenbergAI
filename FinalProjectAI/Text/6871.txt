Baseball Runs Out of Comebacks


After winning its last two games with dramatic comebacks, the Muhlenberg baseball team could not make it three in a row, falling at home to Swarthmore, 6-4.

The Mules (16-14, 4-7) trailed 6-2 heading into the bottom of the seventh and cut the deficit in half on an RBI single by senior John Muha
and a run-scoring double by sophomore Jimmy Cody. But the Garnet (19-11, 7-4) got out of the inning without further damage, and Muhlenberg had
only one baserunner in the final two innings.

Muha continued his pursuit of the school records for hits by going 2-for-5. He needs two more hits to break the season record of 61 and five more to top the career
mark of 188.

Senior Joseph Vila tied the school record for career extra-base hits with his 55th, a sharp double down the third-base line in the first.

The Muhlenberg golf teams competed together for the first of two times this spring at the Ursinus Invitational. The men came in third out of 10 teams, while the
women were fifth out of eight teams.

Playing for the third day in a row, the men were led by junior Chris DiMaio, who tied for 11th with a 78. Freshman Jonathan Graulich
was two strokes behind.

The women had their best day of the year, finishing third out of the six complete Division III squads. Two of the teams they beat were Centennial Conference foes
Franklin & Marshall and Ursinus.

Sophomore Christina Bryde tied for seventh place with an 87. Sophomores Katie Seeman (left) and Laura Glogovsky
both shot career-low rounds of 103 and 104, respectively.

Muhlenberg College is currently working on a Campus Master Plan. A Campus Master Plan provides an opportunity to review and assess the existing campus buildings and grounds while measuring them against current and future needs. The Master Plan will be closely aligned with the recently completed Muhlenberg College Strategic Plan âMuhlenberg Opens Doorsâ (2017-2022). The master planning process involves input from the College community-faculty, staff, students and trusteesâto guide the future development of the College.
The College has engaged WRT, a Philadelphia-based planning, architecture and landscape architecture design firm, to assist with the development of a Campus Master Plan. WRT will be assisted by a Planning Advisory Committee constituted for the effort consisting of faculty, staff and students. The master planning process provides an opportunity to connect with the greater campus community to dream, discuss, prioritize and reach consensus regarding potential future changes and projects. The process concludes with a development framework and a phased action plan for implementation supplemented with order of magnitude cost estimates for the envisioned projects.

Our team works with students in a variety of ways. We support student clubs and organizations, advise Fraternities/ Sororities, advise the Student Government Association, create Leadership programs, offer meaningful student employment opportunities, and plan co-curricular programming for the Muhlenberg Community.  If you are looking for ways to get involved, learn some new skills, explore your leadership potential, plan a campus event, start a club/organization, and meet other students, we invite you to visit us in the Student Life Suite.

o’grady leads 5 mules on all-cc team



Five members of the Muhlenberg women's soccer team received postseason honors from the Centennial Conference.

Meghan O'Grady (right) was named to the first team for the first time in her career. The junior 



forward earned honorable mention as a freshman and was selected to the second team last year. She is tied for the CC lead in points per game (1.53) with 26 points on 10 goals and 6 assists. O'Grady nearly doubled her point total (29) from her first two seasons, and she will enter her senior season ninth on the Mules' all-time list with 22 career goals.

Another third-time honoree was junior forward Nicolette Miller (left), who made the second team for the second year in a row after earning first-team honors as a freshman. She tied O'Grady for the CC lead in points per game, scoring 11 goals (second in the CC) and adding 4 assists. Miller led the CC in points (21) and goals (9) in league games and will enter her senior season eighth on the program's all-time list with 63 career points.

Junior Michele Toher, sophomore Maggie Neary and freshman CJ Graetzer all received honorable mention. Toher, who also earned honorable mention last year, was second in the CC with an .875 save percentage in league games. Neary, a second-team choice in 2009, started at center back for a defense that allowed only 10 goals in 10 CC contests. Graetzer, one of only four freshmen to earn All-CC honors, was third on the Mules with 16 points.

This is the third straight year that at least five Muhlenberg players made the All-CC squad.

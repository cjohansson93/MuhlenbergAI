Thomas Nets Hat Trick in Men’s Lax Loss




Despite a 53-28 advantage in shots, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team suffered its seventh straight loss, 13-8 to Centennial Conference-leading Washington.

The Shoremen (7-2, 4-0) scored three goals in a 33-second span of the first quarter to take a quick 3-0 lead. The Mules (2-8, 0-4) could never recover and trailed
13-3 before scoring five goals in the final 5:43 of the game.

Freshman Jon Thomas recorded his second hat trick in three games, scoring three goals on only four shots.

Senior Nick Rispoli won 10 of 16 faceoffs, mostly against a Shoreman specialist who entered the week 15th in Division III in faceoff winning percentage.

Junior defenseman Zach Wiener (above) recorded his first career point by assisting on one of the Mules’ fourth-quarter goals.

Playing with two starting defenders out with injuries and several other key players ailing or sick, the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team came up just short in a valiant effort to win its first Centennial Conference game of the season. The Mules battled from behind the whole game but lost at home to Washington, 17-16. 

The Mules’ only lead was 1-0, but they were within a goal or two for

most of the second half. After the Shorewomen took their biggest lead at 10-6 late in the first half, Muhlenberg ran off the last three goals of the half to cut the gap to one.

And unlike Wednesday’s loss to Haverford, in which a one-goal halftime deficit turned into an 18-11 loss, the Mules stayed close the whole way, eventually tying the score at 15-15 on back-to-back goals by junior Alex Bellini with 11:04 left in the second half.

Washington (6-3, 2-1) scored the next two goals, but Muhlenberg again closed to within one on a goal by freshman Stephanie Umbach with 5:11 to play.

The Shorewomen won the ensuing draw and played keepaway until about two-and-a-half minutes remained, when the Mules began going after the ball aggressively. Twice a Muhlenberg player checked the ball out of a stick, but both times Washington recovered the ball.

Finally, with just under a minute to play, senior Sarah Hetrick forced a turnover, giving the Mules a last chance to tie. But Muhlenberg (4-4, 0-4) could not get a shot off at the other end before turning the ball over.

Sophomore Michelle Certosimo had a team-high seven points, recording six assists for the second time in four games. She also notched nine draw controls, one short of the school record.

Umbach scored a career-high six points, and Bellini (four) and junior Molly Davin (five) tied their career highs for goals.

warmack-chipman resigns as v-ball coach



 
After 10 years as head volleyball coach, Jenny Warmack-Chipman is leaving Muhlenberg to take a similar position at a school in her home state of Texas.

Warmack-Chipman is the winningest coach in Muhlenberg volleyball history with a record of 133-152 in her 10 seasons. In 2001, she led the Mules to a 20-11 record, a share of their first Centennial Conference regular-season championship and a second-place finish in the CC Tournament. The Mules returned to the playoffs in 2009, winning seven of their final 10 matches, including a come-from-behind five-set victory against Gettysburg in the final regular-season contest.

Muhlenberg players earned All-CC honors 17 times in her 10 seasons, and one became the first All-American in program history in 2004. Warmack-Chipman coached the program’s all-time leaders in kills, assists and digs.

Warmack-Chipman also served as Muhlenberg’s assistant athletic director, senior woman administrator and advisor to the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.

A 1996 graduate of the University of Texas, where she played on a Longhorn team ranked No. 1 in the country, Warmack-Chipman was an assistant coach at Southern Methodist and Wichita State before coming to Muhlenberg.

Muhlenberg will conduct an immediate search to find her replacement.

All-Stars Pace Field Hockey Past Moravian

A few hours after learning that they had been selected to play in a national all-star game, seniors Kayleigh
Thies and Sierra Lenker helped the Muhlenberg field hockey team to a 5-0 win against
Moravian.

The duo were chosen to participate in the Victory Sports Tours/NFHCA Division III Senior Game, scheduled for
Saturday, November 22, at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.

Statistically, Thies played more of a role in the win against the Greyhounds (7-10) than Lenker, who started in 
goal: The Mule defense held Moravian without a shot.

Thies (left) assisted on the second and third goals to surpass the career milestone of 100 points. She entered
the game with 99 and is only the second player in program history to reach the century mark.

Three other seniors playing in their final scheduled home game – Lauren Jordan, 
Samantha Swire and Christine Germaske – scored goals, while senior Meghan Gill
added an assist. 

Muhlenberg (12-3) scored two goals in the first 10 minutes and took a 4-0 lead into the break 
when freshman Gwen Remaley blasted in her fourth goal on a penalty corner after time ran out in the
half.

The win was the ninth straight for the Mules at home; they scored at least five goals in five of those games. With 49
goals this season, Muhlenberg is just six short of the school record of 55, set nearly 50 years ago in 1965.

Muhlenberg now holds a 5-0 lead in the 2014-15 Matte Award standings. The next four Matte contests will all occur
on November 15, in cross country (women and men), football and women’s basketball.

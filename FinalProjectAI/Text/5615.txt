women’s tennis wins first cc match



Women’s Lacrosse Beaten at Dickinson


Despite a career-best scoring day from senior Taylor Armstrong, the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team fell to 0-2 in the Centennial Conference with an 18-12 loss at Dickinson.

Armstrong scored nine points (two shy of the school record) on four goals and five assists. The five helpers tied for the second-most in team history.

Armstrong was involved in the Mules’ first four goals of the second half, assisting on two and scoring back-to-back goals. The second, with 17:20 showing on the clock, cut the Red Devils’ five-goal halftime lead to three, at 11-8. But Dickinson (4-1, 1-0), which received votes in the Division III poll this week, reeled off the next six goals to pull away.

Junior Sara Hiller and sophomore Danielle Scarrone scored a pair of goals apiece for Muhlenberg (4-2 overall), which connected on 12 of its 20 shots. (corrected 3/20)

Rotfeld owns a 10-1 singles record in CC matches since the start of last year.


Lack of experience at the collegiate level might be detrimental for any varsity team, but that’s not the case with Muhlenberg’s women’s tennis team.

The young Mule squad, featuring three freshmen in the starting lineup, won its Centennial Conference opener against Haverford, 7-2, demonstrating prominent maturity. 

First-year players Caitie Druker (No. 2 singles), Sara Sutker (No. 4 singles) and Danielle Winston (No. 5 singles) went undefeated in both their singles and doubles matches. Sutker steamrolled her two encounters in commanding fashion, giving up only two games on the day.

A fourth freshman, Lindsay Schmidt, came out victorious in the only encounter she played, claiming an 8-4 decision at doubles No. 3 with Winston. 

Junior Carly Rotfeld also contributed a couple of wins, claiming a straight-set success at No. 3 singles and securing an 8-6 victory at No. 1 doubles in partnership with junior Jenn Powell.

FIELD HOCKEY KICKS GRASS





Sophomore Kristen Sabia had a breakaway in the second half, leading to a penalty corner.




The grass hasn’t necessarily been greener for the Muhlenberg field hockey team, but the Mules overcame their tendencies in a 2-0 win at Haverford.

“The grass usually gives us problems. We’re more of a turf team,” said senior 
Jillian Duffy, who scored the second goal. “We came out strong and proved that we can play on grass.”

Muhlenberg, which lost to Moravian in its only previous game on grass, improved to 6-3 overall and 2-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time in program history. Both wins have come on the road, and this one came at a Haverford field at which top-ranked national champion Ursinus needed to come from behind for a 2-1 victory.

The Mules had the better of play most of the game, outshooting the Fords, 20-8, and taking 10 more penalty corners. One of the corners produced the first goal, as sophomore 
Nicki Notarianni put in her own rebound midway through the first half for her team-leading sixth goal of the season.

Notarianni set up the second goal. Early in the second half, Haverford’s goalie attempted to clear her hit, but Duffy got in the way and put in a shot from close range. 

The two goals were plenty for junior Michelle Consiglio, who came into the game second in the CC in goals-against average and save percentage and improved both numbers, making eight saves for her second shutout of the season.

“Communication has been kind of a problem the last few games,” noted Duffy. “We stepped it up a lot today.”

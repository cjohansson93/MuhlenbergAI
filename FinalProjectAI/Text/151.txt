Greg Heller-Labelle, Entrepreneur-in-Residencee-mail: gregheller-labelle@muhlenberg.edu




Greg Heller-LaBelle is Entrepreneur in Residence at Muhlenberg's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program, where he will teach, mentor students, and help develop the program in conjunction with the Program Director. The rest of the time, he's the CEO and co-founder of The Colony Meadery, where he makes delicious alcoholic craft beverages from fermented honey. Prior to that, he drove the success and growth of startup ventures in industries ranging from community banking to math educational technology. A passionate believer in community and economic development, Greg started his career at the economic development nonprofit Riverlife in Pittsburgh, where he coordinated communications around major land development projects, including stadiums and Point State Park revitalization. In his off time, Greg was a writer who had successful blogs on politics, beer and art (and, sometimes, how they interact). Greg earned three degrees from Pitt (BA (Religious Studies, History of Art and Architecture, English Writing), BS (Psychology), BPhil (thesis in fiction), and an MBA from Lehigh.  He has lived in Bethlehem three times, Pittsburgh twice, and Mexico once. Now he lives in Bethlehem with his wife and their bulldog, Disraeli.

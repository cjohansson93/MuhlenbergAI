albright leaves baseballin cold


The Albright baseball team belted four straight extra-base hits in the top of the first and went on to defeat Muhlenberg, 19-9, on a frigid day.

The Mules (3-15-1), playing their last game before beginning their Centennial Conference schedule, scored a season-high nine runs, all in the last five
innings. Junior Nick Busillo drove in two runs with two hits, including a booming double to the fence in right-center,
and senior Jeff Puklin and sophomore Joseph Vila each had two hits and scored two runs.

Sophomore Tim Velys (right), one of eight pitchers used by the Mules, worked a 1-2-3 eighth and has yet to allow a run
in 5 1/3 innings over seven appearances this season.

In Memoriam
Professor of History, Emeritus
Education:
B.A., The University of Wisconsin - Whitewater (1972) M.A., The Johns Hopkins University (1974) Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University (1976) Teaching Fields:American Social, Cultural and Intellectual, 19th and 20th Centuries, History of Disease, Medicine, and Public Health
My graduate training was in the cultural and intellectual history of the United States.  Since coming to Muhlenberg in 1978, I taught a wide variety of topics under that general heading.  I taught numerous advanced courses including Nineteenth Century America, the Civil War and Reconstruction, Women's History, African-American History, Environmental History and the History of Medicine and Public Health.  The topics of my Introductions to History included coming of age in America, the city in American culture, and epidemics in American history.
Since the early 1990s I have focused my scholarly work on the history of the polio epidemics in the United States.  My studies of polio have emphasized the experiences of the individuals who had the disease during the many epidemics prior to the development of the Salk polio vaccine in 1955.  To date I have published three books and several articles on the subject.  I am also particularly interested in the subject of masculinity and disability and have been active in disability studies.

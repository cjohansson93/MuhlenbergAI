FIELD HOCKEY WINS FIRST ROAD GAME





Volleyball 0-2 in Championship Bracket



Less than 12 hours after an emotionally charged win against Susquehanna, the Muhlenberg volleyball team took to the court again to face Penn State Altoona in the Championship
Bracket of the Buttermaker Tournament. The Mules could not duplicate their performance and fell in four games, and they later lost in three games to tournament champion York.

For the second time this season, junior Megan Eiser was named to an all-tournament team. She totaled 132 assists, 51 digs, 22 kills and 11 blocks in the four matches. 
Sophomore Brittany Williams continued her strong play on the second day of the tournament, notching a career-high 14 kills against York.

Shetron totaled three assists in her previous two seasons with the Mules. She has four in three games this year.



The Muhlenberg field hockey team put on a show-stopping performance on the first half of its ”New York, New York” weekend.

Playing on the road for the first time this season, the Mules (2-1) made the Oneonta State field theirs, outshooting the hosts 11-0 and scoring three goals in the first half.
Muhlenberg added a late goal for a 4-1 victory.

Sophomore Nicki Notarianni scored two goals for the second time this season, and senior Kelly Shetron recorded two assists for the second time this season. Senior
Jillian Duffy added her 20th career goal; Notarianni, Duffy and/or Shetron have been involved in eight of the Mules’ first nine goals of the 2007 campaign.

The lone exception is the last goal against the Red Dragons, as freshman Chessie Martinez capped the scoring with her first career goal.

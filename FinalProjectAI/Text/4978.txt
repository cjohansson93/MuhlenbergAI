FOUR MEN’S SOCCER PLAYERS NAMED ALL-REGION; ANTONINI A FIRST-TEAM ALL-AMERICAN
 


 
 
 




Four members of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team were named to the National Soccer Coaches Association of America All-Mid Atlantic region team, the most in school history, and one of them, sophomore Cody Antonini, was selected to the All-America first team.

Antonini (top left center), the Centennial Conference player of the year, was a first-team All-America pick after scoring 12 goals and two assists. He finished second in the CC in points and goals per game and in the top 50 in Division III in goals per game.

Antonini was the lone sophomore on the All-America first team and is Muhlenberg’s first first-team All-American since 1995, when it reached the “Final Four.” He is just the fifth Mule ever to be named to the team.

He was joined on the all-region first team by junior Jason Daniels. In his first season as the starting goalkeeper, Daniels (top right center) posted a 0.70 goals-against average, 34th in Division III, and .786 save percentage. He saved his best for when it mattered most, allowing just four goals in nine CC games and recording six shutouts.

Senior Samuel Hayden was named to the all-region second team. Hayden (top right) started all 17 games at center back, helping the Mules to a CC-leading 0.43 goals-against average in conference play. He added a goal and an assist on the offensive end.

Senior Eric Miller was a third-team selection. Miller (top left) finished second on the Mules with six goals – three of which were game winners – and five assists. He ended his career as Muhlenberg’s active leader in career points (41) and assists (9).

The four all-region selections is the highest total in Muhlenberg history. National champion Messiah was the only other school in the Mid-Atlantic with four all-region picks.

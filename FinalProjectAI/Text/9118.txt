Muhlenberg College Public Health Program - 2022 Pennsylvania Health Poll

 
The following report provides findings from the annual Muhlenberg College Public Health Program Poll of Pennsylvanians on public health issues. This yearâs survey examined topics that included the COVID-19 outbreak and the performance of President Biden and Governor Wolfâs handling of the pandemic, heroin addiction, immunizations and marijuana legalization. The survey marks the 10th year of this initiative that is a partnership between the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion and the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program.

Key Findings

After two full years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pennsylvanians are increasingly optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. Currently, 76% of Commonwealth residents agree that COVIDâs worst impacts are in the past, marking a 19-point increase from November when 57% of Pennsylvanians maintained this opinion.


 

A vast majority (84%) of Pennsylvanians support moving the state away from COVID-19 limits, but among this cohort, there are divisions on the details. Just under half of state residents (47%) support opening up but keeping some precautions. About a third (37%) of Pennsylvanians prefer that the state open up with no COVID-19 mandates or requirements.
Pennsylvanians remain highly divided on President Bidenâs handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 43% approving and 48% disapproving of the 46th Presidentâs performance on this matter. These marks are similar to those from last fall, and significantly more negative than a year ago when 55% approved, and only 25% disapproved of Bidenâs work on the pandemic.


 

Governor Wolfâs COVID-19 efforts continue to draw mixed reviews from Pennsylvanians, with 42% of state residents approving, and 46% disapproving of the job he has done on the pandemic.
About 6 in 10 Commonwealth residents reported they are likely to get an annual COVID-19 booster if one becomes available, with 43% âvery likelyâ and 17% âsomewhat likelyâ to receive this immunization.


 

Keystone States resident views on the quality of health care in the state have declined from pre-pandemic levels, with the percentage of Pennsylvanians rating health care in the state as excellent or good falling from 67% to 55% between 2019 and 2022.
As discussions on the legalization of marijuana for recreational use continue in Pennsylvania, opposition to this possibility continues a long-term decline. Only 1 in 4 adult Pennsylvanians now oppose legalization in the state, with a solid majority (56%) supporting a change to the existing law.


Methodological StatementThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 423 adults in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania between February 15 and March 8, 2022.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (94) and cell phones (329). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues could introduce error or bias into survey results. The sample data has been weighted by gender, race, age, income, and educational attainment to reflect those Pennsylvania population characteristics as reported by the United States Census Bureau in 2022. The calculation of sampling error considers design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of adult Pennsylvanians, both landlines and cell phones are called up to 5 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 5%. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (as seen in its entirety below) was designed by Dr. Christopher P. Borick, Director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion and Professor in the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program. The survey was funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College. For more detailed information on the methods employed please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

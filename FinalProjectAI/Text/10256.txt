Muhlenberg College launched the first of its Red Door InitiativesâThe Muhlenberg Extended Learning program to provide a limited number of grants for students to take free summer courses onlineâat the end of April 2020. These programs combine funds and resources from Muhlenberg College, the Muhlenberg Student Government Association, the Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and gifts from alumni to help Muhlenberg students most in need of support as a result of COVID-19 disruptions.
Available Red Door Initiatives are listed below along with details about each program and associated resources.








 Student Employee Pay Program
During the College's move to remote learning and remote work, many of our students were not able to work the expected number hours in their student employee positions. On May 1, the College shared its plan for sending this financial support to students. Please read the FAQ below for more details.



          Student Employee Pay FAQ
  








What is happening with students who were employed in on-campus jobs?
Muhlenberg will be sending a special paycheck to students who were in hourly positions:

Working on-campus during the first half of the Spring 2020 semester, and
Had a disruption in their on-campus position, either:

Not able to work remotely at all during the second half of the spring semester, or
Not able to work as many hours in their position in the second half of the semester as they did in the first half


Students paid through stipends are already being paid the full amount of their stipends through normal payroll processes. 
 
How much will the payment be?
It will vary from student-to-student. The actual payment will be based on wages earned in the first half of the spring semester, reduced by the wages in the second half of the semester. 
 
Examples:
Student 1
Â» Worked 45 hours in the first half of the semester at $8.00 per hour ($360 in wages).
Â» In the second half, could work remotely but only record 32 hours ($256 in wages).
Â» The one-time payment will be $104.
 
Student 2
Â» Worked 60 hours in the first half of the semester at $8.00 per hour ($480 in wages).
Â» In the second half, this studentâs position could not be shifted to remote work ($0 in wages).
Â» The one-time payment will be $480.
 
Student 3
Â» Worked 55 hours in the first half of the semester at $8.00 per hour ($440 in wages).
Â» In the second half, this studentâs position moved to remote work and the student worked 55 hours ($440 in wages).
Â» This student earned the same in the second half of semester than the first half and received their full wages for the semester.
 
How is this payment being made?
The special payment will be made through the Collegeâs payroll office, the same as other payments to student employees. It will be paid on May 29, 2020. For faster receipt of funds, we encourage students to sign up for direct deposit if they haven't done so already (see below for direct deposit details). 
 
Is this post-semester payment taxable?
By law, it is subject to the same tax requirements as other student employment pay. 
 
I worked at two or three on-campus jobs and I continued at one but lost hours at the other(s)?
The one-time payment is based on total pay for all student employee positions worked at the College. Students will be treated the same whether they worked in one position or multiple positions. 
Students who are working as Residence Assistants (RAs) and in positions receiving stipends are being paid the full amount of their stipends. 
 
Why did Muhlenberg wait to announce this?
The College was anticipating that the Federal CARES Act would provide some assistance to students whose on-campus jobs were unable to be performed remotely, or were curtailed by the move to remote work. When the act was passed by Congress, it was unclear if CARES Act funds could be used to support students whose employment was no longer available or reduced.
With that uncertainty, and the knowledge it would soon be clarified, the College senior staff deferred a final decision on the details of payment distribution. This position was affirmed by several national higher education associations also awaiting further guidance. Making a decision on this issue before a clarifying statement was released by the U.S. Education Department may have risked studentsâ ability to receive assistance. 
In its CARES Act announcement on April 21, 2020, the Education Department ruled that CARES Act student grants cannot be made for lost student employment positions or reduced hours. That decision is disappointing, but not likely to be reversed. Once it was made, the College senior staff created this new plan. 
 
I was getting paid by check. How do I sign up for direct deposit to receive my money more quickly?
If you are interested in signing up for Direct Deposit, please send an email by May 15 to payroll@muhlenberg.edu from your Muhlenberg email account. Your email should state your intent to receive payroll funds through Direct Deposit and your current phone number that we can call if we have questions about your request.
After the Business Office has received your email, you will be emailed a Student Employment Direct Deposit Authorization Form along with instructions on how to return this information to us through a secure, encrypted email. 
Once you have completed the form and sent it back to us through a secure, encrypted email, we will validate your banking information in the next payroll. During the payroll period that your banking information is being validated, you will receive a check. After your banking information has been validated, then your paycheck funds will be deposited directly into your bank account.
Be sure to start the process right away, so that your banking validation goes through and you can receive your special payroll check through Direct Deposit.


 

Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF)
Muhlenberg College received emergency federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) in 2020 and 2021 to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The College received three separate HEERF allocations resulting from three pieces of legislation: Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, HEERF I), Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSAA, HEERF II), and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP, HEERF III).

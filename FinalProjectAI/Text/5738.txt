Freshman Evan Tozer made a splashy debut, scoring 16 points on perfect 6-for-6 shooting. Sophomore Zachary Rosenberg just missed a double-double in his first career varsity game, recording 11 points and nine rebounds. 

Sophomore Obi Nwizugbo (eight points, nine rebounds) and junior Tim Murray (six and eight) both recorded career highs in points and rebounds, and 
sophomore Brian Frankoski scored eight points in his first career start.

Through world-class studio training and rigorous academics, the Theatre & Dance Department aims to produce flexible, collaborative, inspired artist-thinkers, well-equipped to contribute to the greater good.
The Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance experience offers a direct learning partnership among faculty and studentsâin the classroom, the studio and the performance laboratory. Students are nurtured to succeed and encouraged to take risks. The department offers students daily opportunities to foster the most important goal of the liberal arts experience: education of the whole person.
Theatre & Dance faculty and staff have developed a multi-faceted approach to education that combines exciting creative experience with rigorous professional standards. Students are challenged as artists in the studio and the classroom, working closely with distinguished faculty and internationally recognized guest artists to achieve a conceptual understanding and a practical working knowledge of the performing arts.

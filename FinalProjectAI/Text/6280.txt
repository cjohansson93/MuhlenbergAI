Late Rally Comes Up Just Short for Women's Lacrosse at McDaniel
 Friday, April 6, 2012







					 





Good things may come to those who wait. But unfortunately for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team, it waited just a little bit too long to get its offense going at McDaniel.

The Mules scored eight of the final 10 goals of the game, including seven in the last 10:11, to rally from seven down and pull within one twice in the closing five minutes. But that would be as close as they would get as the Green Terror denied them their first Centennial Conference win with a second consecutive one-goal loss, 15-14.

Junior Molly Davin led the charge, scoring all five of her goals during the late rally, including three straight in a span of 1:29 to pull the Mules (4-5, 0-5) within one, 14-13, with just over five minutes to play.

McDaniel (5-7, 2-4) tacked on its final tally a little more than a minute later, but Davin struck again off a feed from freshman Kayleigh Thies to make it a one-goal game once again with 1:22 left. 

Sophomore Kaitlyn McCaffrey caused a turnover on the Green Terror’s ensuing possession, and the Mules got a free position attempt with 34 seconds left. But the shot was saved, and McDaniel was able to run out the clock.

For the second straight game, Davin tied her career high with the five goals. Senior Kelsey Elmer (2 G, 4 A) recorded six points, and freshman Stephanie Umbach (4 G, 1 A) added five. Senior Angela Napoletano chipped in a goal and two assists to move within three points of 100 for her career. (corrected 4/10/12)

McCaffrey caused three turnovers and picked up six ground balls, and senior Jessica Shegoski (right) added a career-high five ground balls.

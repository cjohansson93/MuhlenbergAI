softball drops two; golf eighth



The Muhlenberg and Dickinson softball teams added to their recent series of low-scoring, tight games with two more, but unlike last season the Mules came out on the wrong 
end of both.

The Red Devils held off a late Mule charge to win the first game, 3-1, and shut down the Muhlenberg bats to take the second, 2-1.

The Mules (10-15, 5-7) had just three hits through the first six innings of Game 1 before threatening in the seventh. Junior Ashley Brewer led off the final frame by 
lining a triple to right field, and junior Jess Kasza (left) followed with a double to left.

But Dickinson (13-14, 6-4) made a pitching change, bringing in the hurler with the third-most strikeouts in the Centennial Conference. She struck out the next three Mule batters to end the game.

Muhlenberg struck first in Game 2, again behind Brewer and Kasza. Brewer led the game off by reaching on a two-base error and took third on a passed ball. With one out Kasza drove her home with a single to right center.

But Dickinson would plate two runs in the bottom of the first, and the Mules would record just one hit the rest of the way. Freshman Angie Sisco allowed just four hits over her six innings of work, and both of the runs she allowed were unearned.

The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished eighth out of 12 teams at the Susquehanna Spring Invitational despite a phenomenal round from Eric Boskey. The junior
shot a 5-over-par 75, 10 strokes better than his previous career best, to place sixth.

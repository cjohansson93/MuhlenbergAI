Field Hockey Upsets No. 9 Montclair State

Efficiency was the name of the game for the Muhlenberg field hockey team as it defeated nationally ranked Montclair State, 2-1.

Sophomore Christine Germaske came off the bench and got the Mules on the scoreboard with 9:54 left in the first half. After rebounding a shot by teammate Erin Cummings, she fired the ball past Montclair State’s goalie.




Germaske’s goal was the second of her career.


“We stayed composed and did the simple things right. We didn’t let a nationally ranked team get into our heads,” said Germaske.

Doing the “simple things right” meant playing effectively when scoring opportunities arose. The Mules took just eight shots during the game, but five of them were on goal and two found the back of the net.

The Mules’ second goal of the night came exactly five minutes after their first. Sophomore Samantha Swire scored in similar fashion to Germaske, rebounding a wide shot by teammate Dayna Hovern and putting it away for her first career goal.

Muhlenberg was about a half a second away from shutting out Montclair State, whose only goal came from a penalty stroke that was awarded as time expired. But it was not enough to stop the Mules’ first win against a top-10 team since 2009.

As evidenced by their 23-8 margin in shots, the Red Hawks controlled the ball for most of the game. However, tough defense by the Mules and quick reactions by senior goalie Kristen Dornenburg thwarted every scoring attempt by Montclair State, with the exception of its penalty stroke at the conclusion of the game.

The veteran Dornenburg recorded 12 saves for the Mules, bringing her career total to 426. She is now less than 100 saves away from topping Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

Germaske credited the team’s outstanding defense as well its chemistry with preventing Montclair State from scoring until the very end.

“Our goalie was strong in the cage. We all trusted each other and knew how to work the ball up from our back line.”

Muhlenberg anticipated that facing the undefeated Montclair State would be a challenge. The Mules were coming off a 2-0 loss to Elizabethtown and a nailbiting overtime win against Scranton. The Red Hawks, on the other hand, won their first two games in decisive fashion, shutting out Eastern 4-0 and pounding Rensselaer 8-2.

The Mules, however, refused to be intimidated.

“Coming off the loss to Elizabethtown showed us a lot. We have been practicing hard and we did everything we could out there tonight. We stayed positive and didn’t ever get down on ourselves,” said Germaske.

Chili scored all of 
her career-high 19 points in the final 16 minutes as Muhlenberg came from behind on the road to defeat Gettysburg, 72-63, in a rematch of the 2008 CC championship game. The two teams were predicted to finish 1-2 in the CC preseason poll.

From the time of Chili’s first points to her last, the Mules outscored the Bullets 37-19. She hit three three-pointers in a span of 1:17 and finished the game 5-of-8 from behind the arc. She also had three assists and two blocked shots.

Through three games, Chili leads Muhlenberg in three-pointers (nine) and steals (six) and is second in scoring average (11.7 points per game) and assists (12).

Chili is the second Mule in as many weeks to win the CC weekly award. Senior Lauren Boyle was honored after her MVP performance in the Scotty Wood Tournament.

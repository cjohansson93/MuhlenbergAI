About Me: I am originally from the Los Angeles area and currently reside in Orange County, CA with my husband. I attended Scripps College where I earned a BA in anthropology and also have a Master in Education in Higher Education from Notheastern University. In my free time I love going to the movies (proud AMC Stubs member!), collecting rocks and minerals, and making crafts for my Etsy shop.
Advice for Prospective Students: Be proud of where you are today. You are enough and you are doing enough. This process should be exciting, soul-searching, and a little selfish (the good kind!). Never compare your process to someone else's and remember that you will, in fact, make it somewhere.
Favorite Food on Campus? Hot coffee (no cream or sugar) at Java Joe's, our campus Starbucks! I start my morning with about 3 cups of coffee!

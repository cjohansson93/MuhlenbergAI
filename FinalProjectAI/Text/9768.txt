Smith, a prehealth biology major and a member of Muhlenberg's softball team, was able to spend her summer as a certified podiatric medical assistant at Allentown Family Footcare right here in Allentown. The Muhlenberg connection runs deepâAllentown Family Footcare is owned and operated by a fellow Mule, Dr. Raymond Fritz '82, and is a frequent stop for many other Muhlenberg students to put their best foot forward with their careers.

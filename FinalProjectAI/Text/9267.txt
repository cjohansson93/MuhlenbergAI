The production "for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf," directed by Sharrell Luckett, was a highlight of Muhlenberg College Theatre & Dance's successful 2017-18 season.
The Princeton Review features Muhlenberg College in the new 2019 edition of its flagship college guide, "The Best 384 Colleges."
The College garnered a #9 ranking for "Best College Theater," placing the program among the top 12 in the nation 10 of the last 11 years.
In addition, Muhlenberg was included in the following lists: Best Northeastern Colleges, Green Colleges and the Colleges that Pay You Back, which was âbased on a combination of institutional and student survey data, including academic rigor, affordability and career outcomes for graduates.â
âMuhlenberg is a place where someone can pursue theatre AND chemistry, play a varsity sport AND lead a volunteer organization, work individually with a professor AND befriend a services worker,â wrote one student in response to The Princeton Reviewâs annual survey.
Other students who were surveyed praised the Collegeâs âclose-knitâ community and the rigorous and âwell-rounded liberal arts education.â They also championed their âdedicatedâ professors who create and foster âengaging coursesâ and âreally take the time to get to know you and answer your questions.â Several students mentioned the friendly and collegial campus. âBeing nice is kind of important,â said one.
The quality of College-sponsored events, nearby public parks which provide âgreat areas to hike, explore, bird-watch, read or take a jogâ and Muhlenbergâs relatively close proximity to both Philadelphia and New York were also commended.
âWe're delighted to have Muhlenberg College recognized yet again for our outstanding offerings in theatre,â said John I. Williams, Jr., Muhlenbergâs president. âMuhlenberg is a leader in providing world-class preparation for a career in the performing arts. Our theatre & dance graduates are working both on and off the stage, on Broadway and in professional theater companies through the United States, and our alumni open doors for those coming along behind them. Many of our theatre & dance students choose Muhlenberg because, here, they can double major in any of our other programs, including pre-med, neuroscience, media & communication, business, finance and public health. At Muhlenberg, theatre studentsâas all our studentsâcan have it all!"
âOur students, faculty and staff continue to create remarkable theatre and dance projects on our stages and in our studio classrooms every day,â said Beth Schachter, professor of theatre and chair of theatre and dance. âEach year our faculty and staff teach the most current techniques and technologies to our students, so that we continually create the most vivid, exciting and relevant performances. This ongoing recognition of our continued excellence is very satisfying.â
The rankings for Muhlenberg and other colleges listed in this edition are entirely based on The Princeton Review's survey of 138,000 students attending the colleges. The 80-question survey asks students to rate their colleges and universities on several topics and report on their campus experiences at them. Topics range from their assessments of their professors as teachers to opinions about their college's career services. The Princeton Review explains the basis for each ranking list here.
The Princeton Review is an education services company known for its tutoring, test-prep courses, books and other student resources. It is headquartered in New York, New York, and not affiliated with Princeton University.

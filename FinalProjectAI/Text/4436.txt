The Muhlenberg womens basketball team is ranked 14th in Division III in the first polls of 2011.

The 8-0 Mules, who have been idle since defeating Montclair State on December 18, dropped from No. 13 to No. 14 in the D3hoops.com poll. They were jumped by Illinois Wesleyan, which defeated then-No. 3 Kean and moved from 15th to 11th. Muhlenberg held steady in the 
Womens Basketball Coaches Association poll.

The Mules are undefeated after eight games for the fourth time in program history. They started out 10-0 in 2003-04, 11-0 in 2006-07 and a school-record 13-0 in 2001-02. They return to action with a Centennial Conference game at Dickinson tomorrow night and play their first home game in more than a month against McDaniel on Saturday.

Muhlenberg is joined in the D3hoops.com ranking by CC rival Johns Hopkins at No. 22. The two teams are scheduled to meet on Monday, January 17, in Baltimore.

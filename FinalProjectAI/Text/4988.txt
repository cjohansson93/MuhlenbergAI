women’s basketball wraps up win





McKeon’s 14 points put her over 700 for her career.



Oh there’s no place like home for the holidays.

With less than three weeks left before Christmas and the first snow of the season falling outside, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball 
team took the Memorial Hall court for its first home game in 14 days shopping for another Centennial Conference win.

The 16th-ranked Mules were not in a giving mood, however, as their stingy defense paved the way to an 83-65 victory against Washington. The result extended a pair of streaks: Muhlenberg (4-1, 3-0) has won 25 straight against CC opponents, and the Shorewomen (2-5, 2-2) are winless in 16 all-time trips to Allentown.

The Mules held Washington to 32.3-percent shooting, including just 26.5 percent in the first half. The Shorewomen came in leading the CC in three-point shooting but went just 3-of-14 from behind the arc.

“Our biggest emphasis is defense,” said sophomore Kimberly Mui. “We want to get up on them, pressure them and make them feel uncomfortable.”

Mui made the defensive play of the game with 6:37 left to go in the first half, sprinting down the court to block a breakaway layup attempt after the Shorewomen had thrown over the top of the Mules’ press.

“I just ran as fast as I could and tried to get the block. It was hard to catch up because she was pretty fast,” said Mui. “It felt good. And it stayed in bounds, which was even better.”

surge that decided the game. The score was deadlocked at 20 halfway through the first period, but the Mules closed out the half with a 26-8 run to take a 46-28 lead into the locker room. Washington never got closer 

than 14 points in the second half.

Junior Kelly McKeon scored 12 of her 14 points in the big run. She finished 



Berlin scored six straight points for the Mules early in the game on a three-point play and three-point field goal.



with 10 rebounds for her 13th career double-double and also added four assists. 

Sophomore Alexandra Chili led Muhlenberg with 19 points despite having difficulty getting her shot to fall in the first half. She started out 1-for-9 before flinging in a circus shot along the baseline while getting fouled with 4:14 left in the half.

The Mules’ deep bench helped wear down Washington, which spread out the majority of its minutes among six players. Muhlenberg, on the other hand, used all 14 of its players in the first half and had a 34-6 advantage in bench points. Junior Alexandra Berlin scored eight points in only 13 minutes, freshman Kate Clawson scored seven in 16 minutes, and freshman Julie Kelly, in the first game of her career, contributed seven points in only seven minutes.

And then there was Mui, who scored four points and blocked another shot in the second half, tying the 5-8 guard with Washington’s 6-2 center for the most blocks in the game.

“I’m just trying to play good defense,” she said. “I’ll take whatever comes – blocks, steals, rebounds.”

Ho, ho, ho.

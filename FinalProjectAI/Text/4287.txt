women’s lacrosse storms to win


The sun was shining brightly for the Muhlenberg women's lacrosse team through the first three games of the season. The Mules won all three games, outscoring their opponents 46-18.

Muhlenberg finally experienced some undesirable conditions, both in the air and on the field, in its fourth game, but 




Davin is third on the team with 10 goals, just four fewer than she scored all last year.



weathered the storms to beat Susquehanna, 13-10, in its final game in Hilton Head.

The Mules (4-0) overcame a three-goal second-half deficit in a game 
played mostly in a torrential downpour.

"We knew there was going to be more competition in this game. There were a lot of high school rivals on both teams," said junior Sarah Hetrick, who scored a big insurance goal late in the game. "Coming off the last two games, we had to switch the gears and it took us a while, but we did it."

Muhlenberg scored the last two goals of the first half to take a 5-4 lead, but the Crusaders (1-3) roared back with four goals in the first 6:11 of the second half to pull ahead, 8-5.

The Mules scored the next three, two by sophomore Molly Davin, to tie the game. The teams then swapped four goals, leaving the game tied a 10 with less than five minutes to play.

With 3:33 on the clock, sophomore Alex Bellini took a pass from Danielle Rosen and scored to put Muhlenberg ahead to stay. Also around that time, the sun began to peek out from behind the clouds. It was a good sign.

"From Alex's goal on, we just kept pushing," said Hetrick. "We were pumped that we had finally gotten ahead, and we picked up our intensity."

Just 45 seconds after Bellini's goal, Hetrick scored her second goal of the game off a pass from senior Christine Van Hise. And a minute after that, Rosen added the final goal. 

Rosen finished the game with six points, recording at least four assists for the third time this season. Davin and junior Angela Napoletano netted three goals apiece.

"It made us happy," said Hetrick of winning the close game. "As coach said to us, it's something that's going to get us ready for the games coming up."

The games coming up - including one next Saturday against top-5 Centennial Conference power Franklin & Marshall - will be played after the team returns from a trip that was successful on several fronts, according to Hetrick.

"The trip was a lot of fun," she said. "It was good for team bonding, and we all got closer. We got to know each other on the field as well as off the field. Playing three games in five days, we all got our heads on about how we play together and got to focus on the things we need to work on."

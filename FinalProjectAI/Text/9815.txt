The Dance Major is designed to flexibly meet the student's needs while providing a solid background in dance history and theory, along with intensive study in a variety of dance techniques. The dance major serves as excellent preparation for graduate study and careers in dance. Dance majors typically pursue careers in performance, teaching, choreography, dance therapy, physical therapy, and arts management.
Dance Majors select one or more Concentrations of Study, from among the choices detailed below. Many dance majors choose to pursue multiple concentrations, in preparation for a varied and inclusive career in the performing arts.











          Performance
  








Dance Performance students receive intensive, daily studio training in a wide range of dance techniques, as well as a solid historical and theoretical background in dance. Technique courses are offered through advanced levels in ballet, modern, jazz, and tap, as well as in partnering, aerial acrobatics, pointe, and African dance. Students who wish to pursue a career in dance will be served by both the analytical study and personal development of dance performance.
Small class sizes ensure that students work closely with the Dance Program's internationally acclaimed faculty and guest artists every day, in the studio and on the stage.
A busy performance schedule gives our students frequent opportunities to dance and choreograph for an audience:

Four student-choreographed concerts each year: two Mainstage concerts and two Department-produced Dance Gallery concerts.
An annual Master Choreographers concert, in which students have the chance to work closely with accomplished faculty and guest artists.
The Dance Gallery series each semester, featuring the work of student choreographers and dancers.
Frequent dance-theatre Mainstage collaborations, creating original works and innovative interdisciplinary adaptations.
Grand-scale musical theatre productions that showcase the talents of student dancers.
Three touring ensembles that perform on and off campus throughout the school year: Six Meters improvisational dance company, the Jazz Tap Ensemble, and the DanceMax Moving Company.

Coursework for Performance concentrators includes:

Foundation courses in movement and composition
Five levels of studio training in Ballet and Modern; four levels of training in Jazz and Tap
Courses in anatomy, kinesiology, biology of movement, and somatic practice for dancers
Optional courses in African dances and cultures, dance partnering, aerial acrobatics, pointe and variations, and Laban Movement Analysis.







          Choreography
  








Choreography students focus on specific performance skills in a range of dance techniques, as well as engaging an in-depth study of the process of creative expression through choreography. Available courses include three levels of dance composition, screen dance, and a full range of technique classes. Students also learn the stagecraft of lighting and costume design, and have numerous opportunities to stage works for both informal and mainstage concerts.

          Dance Science
  








The Dance Science Concentration combines dance training with biology, psychology, and anatomy. Many dancers seeking a well-rounded education will pursue both performance and dance science concentrations, often leading to careers in dance medicine, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Course offerings include anatomy, kinesiology, and somatic practice, as well as coursework in the College's excellent biology, psychology, and physics departments.
All dance majors,â of course, continue their studio dance training throughout their four years at Muhlenberg, working closely with the Dance Program's internationally acclaimed faculty and guest artists. Most also continue to perform on the Mainstage and in informal concerts and ensembles.
Academic dance concentrations provide an excellent foundation for continuing studies at the master's degree level. Many dance science students go on to careers in dance medicine, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, and some have gone on to medical school to become doctors specializing in dance medicine. Dance scholarship students can go on to continued study in history and sociology, as well as arts administration and management.
Coursework for Dance Science concentrators includes:

Foundation courses in technique and topics in Dance Science
Anatomy and Kinesiology for Dancers, and Experiential Anatomy & Somatic Practice
Continued training in ballet, jazz, tap, and modern dance
Optional courses in biology, comparative anatomy, physiology, psychology, and general physics

 






          Dance Education
  








The Dance Education concentration prepares the student to teach dance in the K-12 classroom, private studio, or community dance programs. Students can complete both a dance major and Muhlenberg's highly regarded teaching certification program in just four years. Coursework includes a hands-on practicum semester, pedagogy, kinesiology, and composition. Students also have the opportunity to teach professionally at Muhlenberg's Community Dance Center.
All dance majors, of course, continue their studio dance training throughout their four years at Muhlenberg, working closely with the Dance Program's internationally acclaimed faculty and guest artists. Most also continue to perform on the Mainstage and in informal concerts and ensembles.
Academic dance concentrations provide an excellent foundation for continuing studies at the master's degree level. Dance Education students can go on to continued study in pedagogy, history and sociology, as well as arts administration and management.
Coursework for Dance Education concentrators includes:

Foundation courses in movement and composition
Dance teaching theory and methods
Courses in anatomy, kinesiology, and somatic practice for dancers
Continued training in ballet, jazz, tap, and modern dance
Advanced Dance Composition
Stagecraft and design
Optional courses in African dances and cultures
Hands-on experience teaching in the Community Dance Center program and in public schools.

A note about Teacher Certification:
Certification requirements change periodically and vary by state, although most states have reciprocity agreements. You should be sure to research requirements thoroughly if you plan to pursue certification along with your dance education training.
Those pursuing a Pre-K to 4 Teaching Certificate at Muhlenberg may major in any subject, including dance. 
Those pursuing a Grade 4-8 and Grade 7-12 Teaching Certificate need to select a subject for certification. Since Pennsylvania does not offer teaching certification in theatre or dance, students will need to select another major, such as English or mathematics, in addition to their education courses. 
You may pursue a dual major in dance and another subject, in addition to teacher certification, but this goal would be difficult to complete in four years without careful planning. Certification students can certainly take significant coursework in dance â including a dance minor â while completing their degree in four years.

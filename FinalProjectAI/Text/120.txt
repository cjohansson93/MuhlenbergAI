Student Research and Scholarship
Each summer, more than 60 students collaborate with faculty on a variety of research projects each summer as part of Muhlenberg's vibrant research community. Topics can be student- or faculty-driven, and span the natural and social sciences, the humanities and the arts.
Summer Research funding comes from a variety of sources, including national grants and foundation support, Summer Research Grants from the Dean of Academic Life, Research Collaboration Grants from the Provostâs office and generous support from alumni and friends of the College.
During the summer, students are typically on campus for eight to 10 weeks of full-time research and receive a stipend, housing and college credit.
At the discretion of the faculty-mentor, undergraduate researchers are encouraged to join in a weekly summer seminar series in which students summer scholars present and discuss their work. Students are also encouraged to present their work to the entire campus community at the annual Celebration of Student Research and Scholarship poster session early in the Fall semester. Student research can also result in publication in academic journals, and with the support of a faculty mentor, students can also travel off-campus to present their scholarly work at regional, national and international conferences with travel funds provided by the College.
Many students take the opportunity to continue their summer research during the academic year by registering for independent study credit or a research assistantship under the guidance of a faculty member. These programs provide hands-on experience to complement classroom education with practical work experience.

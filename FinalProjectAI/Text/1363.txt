Diversity Education and Social Justice Strategy Sessions
Thank you for your interest in the Office of Multicultural Lifeâs diversity education and social justice programs.  If you would like to invite our staff members to provide a presentation, workshop, or other types of event, please fill out the online form below.
Our staff can provide sessions and development opportunities to student organizations, university departments/units, and community affiliated organizations.  Please note that we need to receive your request with as much advance notice as possible (a minimum of two weeks).  Once you submit a request we will contact you to arrange a pre-training meeting to discuss issues and duration of session based on your needs.  Most sessions require at least a 2 hour time commitment.  If you have questions or need accommodations, please contact our office at 484.664.4006 or the Program Manager at multicultulturalcenter@muhlenberg.edu.

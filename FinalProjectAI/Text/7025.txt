Volleyball Splits Opening Four Matches

Before the Muhlenberg volleyball team took the court to warm up for its final match at the DeSales Invitational, junior co-captain Holly Hynson borrowed a mop from the corner of the gym and did some cleaning of the playing surface. And that wasn’t the only sweeping the Mules did.


Muhlenberg swept Albright and Ithaca on the second day of the tournament to finish the season-opening event with a record of 2-2. On the first day, the Mules were swept by tournament champion Cabrini before dropping a five-set thriller to DeSales.

Freshman Allison Glass was named to the all-tournament team after making an impressive collegiate debut. The outside hitter (left) averaged a team-best 3.50 kills and 2.21 digs per set. She had 20 kills and 15 digs in the DeSales match.

The Mules won the three sets in the Albright match decisively, 25-15, 25-17 and 25-13. Glass had 11 kills and was supported by the efficient hitting of sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller (6 kills in 8 attempts) and Erin Murphy (5 kills in 9 attempts).



Sophomores Chelsea Kaser (11) and freshman Elizabeth Garrison (10) both reached double figures in digs, while Glass and junior Nicki Dickson each recorded 4 of the Mules’ 16 aces. Sophomore Katherine Boll had 5 blocks.

Muhlenberg trailed 10-7 early in the Ithaca match before going on a 6-0 run behind the serving of Kaser. But the top server of the match was Dickson, who recorded 8 aces to go along with 8 digs and 21 assists. Dickson (right) had back-to-back aces twice in the second set and a run of three straight aces in the third set.

Weyhmuller again made her hits count, recording 8 kills on 11 attempts, and Boll also had 8 kills.

The two sweeps helped ease the sting of the DeSales loss, in which Muhlenberg came back from a first-set loss to take the next two sets. The Bulldogs won the fourth set to force a decisive fifth set between the two teams for the second straight season. In that fifth set, the Mules came back again, forging a 10-10 tie before DeSales scored the next four points en route to a 15-11 win.

Kaser had 21 digs in the marathon, and sophomore Vanessa Pulice had a double-double with 13 assists and 13 digs.

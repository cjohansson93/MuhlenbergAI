My father was stationed in China during World War II. I heard stories from him about what it was like. A peasant there told my father: âDonât worry about how chaotic China is today. In 50 to 100 years, China will be great again.â And indeed, China has risen again.
My undergraduate mentor was from Burma, and that reinforced my interest in Asia. When I went for my masterâs degree, I worked with a southeast Asian specialist, but nothing quite piqued the same interest in me as China. The problem when I first came to Muhlenberg was there was already an East Asian specialist. When he retired, I took over.
I joined the ASIANetwork, a group of representatives from 170 colleges that teach East Asian studies, and I met other people interested in China. In 2016, I co-authored a book, Chinaâs Peaceful Rise: Perceptions, Policy and Misperceptions, with one of those people. The third co-author, Surain Subramaniam â93, was a student of mine.
Now, Iâm looking at Chinese foreign policy rhetoric in collaboration with [Assistant Professor of Computer Science] Jorge Reyes Silveyra. We use official Chinese government translations of speeches of various high-level leaders and do a content analysis: Which words do they use the most, and how does that change over time? Throughout the entire [former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China] Hu Jintao period, the word âHuâ does not appear as one of the most used terms. You get into the Xi Jinping era, and suddenly one of the most used terms is âXi Jinping.â This is just one more indication of his concentration of power.
Chris Herrick is a professor of political science and the director of the international studies and political economy & public policy programs at Muhlenberg College. Why I Study is a recurring feature in Muhlenberg Magazine. This article was first published in the Fall 2019 issue.

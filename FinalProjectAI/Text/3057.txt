follow mule sports on twitter


There is a new way to follow Muhlenberg’s athletics — on Twitter.


Twitter is a popular social networking and micro-blogging service for friends, family and fans to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of 
short (140-character) messages. Each Mule sports team has a Twitter site set up 
where “followers” will be able to get in-game score updates, links to articles and videos and other news. There is also a general site for those interested in
all Muhlenberg teams.
The updates will appear on the individual user’s Twitter page and can also be sent to the user’s mobile phone via text message (standard messaging rates apply).

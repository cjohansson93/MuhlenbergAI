Field Hockey Comes Back to Gain First Win in Overtime

If Muhlenberg’s field hockey home opener had gone on much longer, it might have been suspended due to a round of lightning that lit up the

sky around Scotty Wood Stadium. But that didn’t happen, because lightning of a different sort struck on the field.

Freshman Kayleigh Thies scored with 8:50 left in the first overtime to give the Mules their first win of the season, 2-1 against Drew.

Thies set up the goal when she was taken down from behind around the 25-yard line, earning a penalty corner. Sophomore Dayna Hovern’s insertion went to the top of the circle to sophomore Mariah Alston, whose passed to Thies on her left. Thies’ shot carried into the cage for her first career goal.

But in a game that featured many firsts – the first career goals for Thies and freshman Christine Germaske and the first career points for Alston and freshman Allison Califano – the most important first was the first win.

“I’m really proud of our team because we didn’t get down,” said Hovern. “We could have dug ourselves a hole when they scored. But we really fought for the win. I think that’s going to show this year. No game is going to be easy – we’re in a very competitive conference. If we play the way we did today, we’ll be successful.”
 
The Rangers (3-3), who beat the Mules 4-0 last year and defeated two

opponents by a combined 11-1 over the weekend, opened the scoring late in a close first half that featured opportunities for both teams.

Muhlenberg (1-3) tied the score 13 minutes into the second half when Califano split two defenders with a pass in the circle to Germaske, who shot it in from close range.

The Mules took twice as many shots as Drew through the rest of regulation, but neither team could score and the game headed to 7-on-7 overtime.

“Personally, I like 7-on-7 better,” said Hovern. “I like to be able to run into space, and when you play 11-on-11 the field tends to get cluttered. You lose the true essence of passing. When you play 7-on-7 you know it’s going to be intense: you’re playing to win!”

Win the Mules did, and in come-from-behind fashion to boot. It’s a sign of changing times for Muhlenberg, which did not get a win until its 10th game last year. And the new faces on the team, including the three who contributed to the scoring, have plenty to do with it.

“The freshmen have been an amazing asset,” said Hovern. “After the year we had last year, something had to change. They’re going to be a great group, and we’re going to go up from here.”

Key Findings

About 2 out of 3 adult residents of Allentown give the city a positive rating as a place to live, with 10% saying Allentown is an excellent place to reside, and 56% rating the city as a good place to live.
While most Allentown residents give the city a positive rating as a place to live, more (46%) say life in the city is getting worse than say it is getting better (29%). This is a reversal from 2017 when most residents (53%) of the city indicated that life in Allentown was getting better, and only 27% said it was getting worse.
As it was in 2017, crime and safety issues were identified as the most important issues facing the city, with 37% of Allentonians offering this topic as the key issue.
Allentown residents are divided on if Mayor Ray OâConnell deserves reelection, with 28% stating he deserves another term, 28% indicating he doesnât and 48% unsure if OâConnell deserves to be reelected as the Queen Cityâs chief executive.
A majority (57%) of Allentown residents give the cityâs response to the COVID-19 a positive evaluation, with 14% indicating the response was excellent and 43% saying it was good.

Methodological StatementThe following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 410 residents of the City of Allentown between April 8 and 15, 2021. Respondents were interviewed on both landlines (138) and cell phones (272). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with a smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. The data has been weighted by age, race and gender to reflect population parameters in Allentown in 2020 as established by the United States Bureau of the Census. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above. In order to reach a representative sample of likely voters, both landlines and cell phones were called up to 4 times. The response rate for this survey as calculated using the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) RRII formula is approximately 7%. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%.  The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by Dr. Christopher P. Borick of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by the Morning Call and the MCIPO. For more detailed information on the methods employed please contact the MCIPO at 484-664-3444 or email Dr. Borick at cborick@muhlenberg.edu

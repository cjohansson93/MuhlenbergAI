"Temporality and Social Media: In Theory and in Practice"
As human beings, we are inherently social creatures. From the moment we wake up to the moment we go to bed, we are interacting and socializing with other people. In these instances, we can present a different version of ourselves and perform differently in a given context. In the 21st century, these social interactions not only happen in a physical space or face- to-face; rather, more and more they are happening in a digitized setting and, more specifically, social media.Through my research, I am interested in exploring the dynamic interplay between the imagined construction of time by designers of social media platforms and the construction of time by users. The initial designed temporal dimensions of the apps will elicit different performances on the part of the user. However, construction of time in practice by social media users may also enable updates and re-construction of the platform by designers. Ultimately, this study will aim to critically assess the level of agency of the social media user, the degree of self- awareness, and the tension between designers and users that is described above. My study utilizes a guided tour methodology to interview 8 volunteers about their social media practices on the âbig fourâ platforms in the United States: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. My goal through this research is to propose new strategies for social media users to encourage them to incorporate a heightened level of self-awareness in their practices online, specifically in terms of how they construct time.

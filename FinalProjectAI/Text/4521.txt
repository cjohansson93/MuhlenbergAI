Preview

men’s soccer clash tomorrow night


Its No. 8 vs. No. 20, or No. 9 vs. No. 19, depending on which poll you go by.

But in the Centennial Conference standings, it will be No. 1 vs. No. 2 when Swarthmore visits Varsity Field for a key mens soccer showdown tomorrow night.

Swarthmore (12-1-2 overall) leads the CC with a 5-0-2 record, two points ahead of Muhlenberg at 4-0-3. With just

two games left in the regular season, the winner of this game (if there is one) will have the inside track on the top seed and hosting rights for the CC playoffs. In fact, the Garnet will clinch the top seed with a win tomorrow night. If the Mules win, they would still need to defeat Ursinus (2-12-1, 0-7) on Saturday to secure the top seed.

A tie favors Swarthmore, which closes out the regular season at home against archrival and CC playoff hopeful Haverford (7-5-2, 3-3-1).

hosting the tournament. And God knows if we could get that here, thatd be amazing, said senior back Eric Williams

Swarthmore was ranked No. 1 in Division III last week but lost to Richard Stockton the day after the poll came out. In the new polls, the Garnet is ranked 
eighth by D3soccer.com and ninth by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.

Thanks to a loss by Dominican on Sunday, Muhlenberg (9-0-6 overall) is one of two undefeated teams remaining in Division III (Wisconsin-Oshkosh is the other). The Mules' 15-game unbeaten streak is a school record. They are ranked 19th by the NSCAA and 20th by D3soccer.com.

Playing a highly ranked team will be nothing new for the Mules. Last year, they went 1-1-1 against teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the game, beating No. 10 Dickinson, tying No. 6 Swarthmore and falling to No. 7 Montclair State. In 2007, Muhlenberg split with top-10 teams, defeating No. 7 New Jersey and losing to No. 8 Johns Hopkins. The Mules also posted home wins against top-10 Johns Hopkins squads in both 2003 and 2005.

Muhlenberg and Swarthmore have played three very close games the last three years. In 2007, the Mules won 1-0 on a spectacular shot with 6:35 left in the second overtime. In 2008, the Garnet scored the lone goal on a quick restart in the 18th minute. And last year, the teams played to a scoreless draw.

The game features two of the top scoring threats in the CC, the region, and possibly all of Division III. Through games of October 17, Swarthmore senior Morgan Langley led the country in assists per game, while Muhlenberg junior Cody Antonini was tied for second in goals per game and tied for fifth in points per game.

Its the biggest game of my career, the biggest game of every seniors career, said Williams. Theyve got a turf field; theyre used to quick-on-the-ball, clean play. Here its a little choppy; its kind of our style and a little tougher to play on. So hopefully thatll work to our advantage.

women’s basketball ignores history



Having won only once at McDaniel’s Gill Center in the past eight years, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was expecting a difficult game against the 
defending Centennial Conference regular-season champion, but instead showed a total disregard for history and ended up securing their biggest road victory in the

league this season.

The Mules steamrolled the Green Terror, 69-51, for their biggest margin of victory in the series since 1997.         

“The victory wasn’t as easy as it seemed,” said sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley, who scored five of her 11 points in a 15-0 first-half run that gave the visitors a
29-12 lead. “We knew how tough playing here is, but today we played our game.” 

Junior Erin McSherry led a confident Muhlenberg team, which shot 43.8 percent from the floor and 37.5 percent beyond the three-point arc. McSherry 
notched a career-high 14 points and finished with five rebounds and two blocks. 

Freshman Sheila Cook tallied her third double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds, while sophomore Alexis Bates contributed 12.

Cook and McSherry’s huge presence in the paint in the first half helped the Mules established a comfortable 37-21 lead. Muhlenberg’s biggest cushion reached 25 
points, 66-41, with 6:24 remaining.

Execution in the post was the difference between the two teams in the game as the Mules outscored the Green Terror, 44-20, in the paint. Another crucial factor 
for the victory was Muhlenberg’s season-low eight turnovers.

“We want to establish ourselves in good position in the conference and that’s why we needed to maintain our winning streak,” O’Malley said.

The Mules registered their third straight victory and second away from home, improving their CC record to 10-3 (15-5 overall) and occupying second place in the conference. 
Muhlenberg limited the Green Terror (9-10, 8-5) to season-low 51 points at Gill Center.

The win was the second for the Mules against the Green Terror this season after claiming a 67-60 home success on Jan. 9. 

“The win marks the end of a long run against high-caliber teams for us in a short period of time and it keeps us in contention for the number one place in the 
conference,” head coach Ron Rohn said.”Wednesday’s victory against Ursinus and today’s success are the best back-to-back wins all season, which is a 
good sign with playoff time coming up.”

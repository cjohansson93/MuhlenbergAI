The associate provost for faculty and diversity initiatives is tasked with supporting faculty efforts in pedagogy, curriculum, scholarship and leadership. As associate provost, Vick will also chair the Presidentâs Diversity Advisory Council, tracking the implementation of Muhlenbergâs Diversity Strategic Plan and contributing to the development of policies and practices that help sustain a diverse, inclusive and equitable community.
"Brooke Vick brings to her position as associate provost of faculty and diversity initiatives a deep understanding of theory and research in intergroup dynamics and experience applying these ideas to support inclusion and equity in higher education," said Kathleen Harring, Muhlenberg College provost. "I am thrilled that she is joining Muhlenberg and the provost senior staff team."
"I learned from my first steps on campus that Muhlenberg College can be a wonderfully welcoming place," said Vick. "I'm excited to help create opportunities to bridge constituencies at Muhlenbergâthe work I will be a part of should have ripples throughout campus, and I'm excited to help facilitate those important conversations."
Vick earned her B.A. in psychology, with a minor in womenâs studies and a concentration in theater, from Colorado College and her M.A. and Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
She previously served on the faculty at Whitman College, where she taught social psychology, the psychology of prejudice, social stigma and intergroup relations. At Whitman, Vick was awarded the Robert Y. Fluno award for Distinguished Teaching in the Social Sciences and was named a Paul Garrett Fellow, a distinction that recognizes excellence in teaching and scholarship at the college. She provided leadership to the Whitman inclusion, diversity and equity (WIDE) council, led faculty workshops on inclusive pedagogy and difficult dialogues, championed initiatives to support underrepresented faculty, mentored first-generation students and students of color and supported partnerships with community non-profit organizations.

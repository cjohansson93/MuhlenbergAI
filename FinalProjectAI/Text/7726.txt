The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team completed a perfect opening weekend with a 2-0 win against Marywood. Junior Taylor Pini opened the scoring early in the second half.

“I was just running down the line, and I saw that I could beat [the defender], so I took her inside and I just went for the shot and got it in,” Pini said.

The goal was especially sweet for Pini, who hit the crossbar late in the first half.



“Yeah, it was good to know how hard we worked to get up there and to finish it,” she said. “Then we got another one from Kaitlin. It just made the whole weekend worth it.”

Sophomore Kaitlin Cassidy gave Muhlenberg some insurance with her first career goal in the 69th minute, and the defense took care of the rest. Junior Jen Mermelstein made four saves.

“The defenders did an awesome job,” said Pini. “They didn’t let anyone past them; they were great stopping the ball before it hit the ground. They just worked really hard, and I’m really proud of us as a team. We worked well together.”

It was the first time since 1999 that the Mules began a season with two shutout wins. Muhlenberg’s play this weekend, despite missing a few injured players, gives the team plenty of confidence for the season.

“It definitely is going to build our confidence, because we had a really long preseason. We worked really hard,” said Pini. “Next weekend we have another two games, and now that we know we could do it the first time out, I think we’re going to be even more confident to be able to do it again.”

Ciarla Yearbook
Be part of Muhlenberg's history! The Ciarla is one of the College's oldest and most meaningful traditions, dating back to 1893. Created by and for Muhlenberg students, the Ciarla is an important record of each year in the life of the College community. The hardcover yearbook is geared towards every Muhlenberg student, with a particular focus on the graduating class. An electronic yearbook is also available to accompany the print yearbook.
The annual publication highlights the yearâs events from Opening Weekend to Commencement. The Ciarla is published during the summer and mailed to students' homes in the fall in order to include spring events, spring sports and graduation. 
Ciarla offers student staff the opportunity to use and enhance their creativity, writing, communication, management and business skills.
Please send inquiries to the Ciarla staff at ciarla@muhlenberg.edu.

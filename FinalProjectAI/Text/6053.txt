Women's Soccer Pleases Crowd in Home Opener

Men’s Soccer Gives Muhlenberg Matte Lead; Field Hockey Falls



The men’s soccer team gave Muhlenberg an early edge in the 2011-12 Matte Award competition, shutting out Moravian, 2-0.

Playing on a tight field, the 17th-ranked Mules (3-0) took a while to get adjusted but maintained control for most of the last 60 minutes, especially in
the second half. Both goals came in the second half.

The first score came with 26:17 left when freshman Travis Wantchekon received the ball running down the flank, cut in and finished 
past the goalie for his first career goal. Later, junior Danny Way finished a breakaway off a through ball by sophomore Jeff
Reinhart.

The Greyhounds (0-3) did not threaten much and took only three shots.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team took to the road for its first game in a week and lost at undefeated Montclair State, 4-1. A pair of seniors teamed
up for the Mules’ lone goal, with Courtney DeAngelis setting up Jillian Katz.

CJ Graetzer tried not to pay attention to her vocal cheering section. Her play on the field made the reverse impossible.

The sophomore midfielder recorded her first collegiate multiple-goal game, scoring once in each half in the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team’s home-opening 4-1 win against Delaware Valley.

“Oh, I don’t know, they’re just some of my friends,” said a laughing Graetzer of the fans who chanted her name during the game, especially in the second half when she had a shot at a hat trick. “I’m just glad they’re supporting us. They definitely put a smile on my face.”

So did her teammates, who dominated the game in posting

their second win in as many nights. The Mules (3-1) outshot the Aggies (2-1) by a 29-4 margin, although they led only 1-0 after taking 21 shots in the first half alone.

“Yesterday we played on turf and it was a much faster field,” said Graetzer, referring to a 3-0 win at Gwynedd-Mercy. “It was hard to adjust to the long grass on our field, but we came ready to play and moved the ball really well in the first 15 minutes.”

That good ball movement resulted in a goal in the 11th minute, when senior Meghan O’Grady headed a ball near the top of the box to Graetzer, who was cutting in on the left and appeared to be offside. But the linesman kept his flag down, and Graetzer rolled the ball past the goalie for a 1-0 lead.

Muhlenberg added two goals about 10 minutes apart early in the second half to finally get some breathing room. Senior Nicolette Miller set up the first with a strong run down the middle of the field. Her shot hit the crossbar, but junior Jillian Moretto was there to bang in the rebound for her second goal of the season.

Sophomore Stephanie Tramutola, who beat the Aggies with her runs down the right sideline all night, assisted on Graetzer’s second goal with a long cross to the far post.

Freshman Audrey Zamichow closed out the Mules’ scoring with her first career goal with 7:35 to play. Delaware Valley spoiled the shutout with about five minutes left, but by then almost all of the Mule starters were relaxing on the bench and enjoying the team’s third straight win.

“We work hard and we have great chemistry,” said Graetzer. “Our biggest challenge this season was adjusting to our new formation. We really came together and made it work.”

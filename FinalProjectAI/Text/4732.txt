Women’s lax goes for a run,stays in playoff hunt  


Cold and windy conditions usually aren’t most people’s idea of good running weather, but they were just fine for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team.

The Mules went on a big 6-0 run that began at the very end of the first half and extended late into the second en route to an 8-4 victory over Swarthmore.




Scarrone has set new career highs for goals (16) and assists (13) this season and has tied her career high in ground balls (13).







“We got off to a slow start, and at halftime we just realized that we needed to pick it up,” said senior Ashley Foltiny. “It came down to who wanted it more.”

Muhlenberg may have wanted it more, but less was the operative word for the day. The Mules entered the week ranked 25th in Division III in scoring offense with an average of better than 15 goals per game. But the eight goals tied for the program’s fewest ever in a Centennial Conference victory and was the team’s lowest output in a win since an 8-7 defeat of Elizabethtown in 2006.

“It was a physical game,” noted Foltiny of the low-scoring affair. “There were a lot of calls going both ways. That kind of held us on offense.”

Held or not, the win was crucial, as it kept the Mules alive in the race for the CC playoffs. Dickinson fell to Ursinus, 9-3, and McDaniel knocked off Haverford, 13-12, in double overtime, putting Muhlenberg, McDaniel and Dickinson in a three-way tie for the fifth and final playoff berth. The Green Terror and Red Devils square off on Wednesday; the Mules hold the head-to-head tiebreak over McDaniel but not Dickinson.

“We’re excited,” commented Foltiny. “We have two really big games next week and now we have momentum and are going into those with confidence. Any team can win on any day. We just have to want it and come out strong the whole game.”



Men’s Lax Beaten by No. 15 RPI



The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team fell behind 5-0 early and never recovered, falling to No. 15 Rensselaer, 12-7.

The Engineers (10-1) scored with six seconds left before the break to enter halftime leading, 6-1. The Mules (5-7) made it 7-3 in the third quarter before Rensselaer rattled off five straight to put the game well out of reach. 

Sophomore Alex Ardolino and freshman Jack Reilly each had two goals and an assist for Muhlenberg.

Muhlenberg came out strong against Swarthmore, as senior Alyssa Bascelli narrowly missed giving the Mules a 1-0 lead at the 2:59 mark when her shot hit the post. Just 1:06 later junior Danielle Rosen did just that, finding the back of the net on an assist from senior Danielle Scarrone.

But the Garnet (7-7, 1-5) shut the Mule offense down for nearly the rest of the half. Swarthmore finally tied the score 14:45 in and added two more over the next 13 minutes to take a 3-1 lead.

With 37 seconds left in the half the Mules gained possession looking for an important goal before the break. They got it just 15 seconds later, as Rosen returned the favor to Scarrone, cutting the deficit in half.

After that it was all Muhlenberg. Scarrone again scored on a feed from Rosen just 52 seconds into the second half to tie the score. Rosen and freshman Molly Davin then scored goals 1:42 apart, and nearly 10 minutes later senior Amanda McGovern netted two goals in the span of 27 seconds.

After Swarthmore finally ended the run with under nine minutes to play, Rosen added one more for good measure, giving her her 10th hat trick of the season in 13 games.

“We kept our composure and played together,” said Foltiny of the big run. “We wanted it and worked hard throughout.”

Foltiny had team bests of four ground balls and three caused turnovers. Freshman Alexandra Franck also caused three turnovers, and Bascelli controlled a game-high four draws. Junior Allisyn Vachon made 10 saves in net.

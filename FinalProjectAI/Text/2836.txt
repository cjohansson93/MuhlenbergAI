faust earns repeatcentennial conference honor


For the second time in three weeks, Muhlenberg senior Alex Faust 
was named Centennial Conference athlete of the week in indoor track and field.

Faust became the first CC athlete this year to hit an NCAA automatic qualifying mark when she cleared 12-7½ in the pole vault at the Muhlenberg 
Invitational, breaking her own school and CC record. The height is tied for the best in Division III so far this season. 

Faust also tied her own school record in the 55 meters, crossing the finish line in 7.57 seconds.

With only three more meets before the CC Championships, Faust ranks in the top two on the CC performance lists in three events. She is first in the
pole vault (by more than two-and-a-half feet) and 400 meters and second in the 55 meters.

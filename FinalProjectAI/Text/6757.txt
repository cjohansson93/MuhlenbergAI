Zabrecky Scores 1,000th Point in Women's Basketball Win
 Tuesday, December 18, 2012







					 

 Men’s basketball



“Wait what did she do?”

That was the playful remark made as the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team gathered around senior Alita Zabrecky to take a celebratory photo following a 93-41 victory over Misericordia.

Zabrecky scored seven points during the game, putting her at an even 1,000 for her career.

“It’s a nice thing to get, ” said Zabrecky, who is the ninth player in program history to reach the milestone.




Zabrecky fires the three-pointer that gave her 1,000 career points.



Her thousandth point came on a nothing-but-net three from the right corner with 5:31 remaining in the first half.

“I have to say, I take a lot of three-pointers that don’t feel good, but that one felt good, ” she laughed.

Head coach Ron Rohn immediately called a 30-second timeout as the team and Muhlenberg fans erupted in cheers. After a brief celebration, the team was back to work.

It had been a sluggish start to the game, with Muhlenberg scoring just eight points in the first seven minutes.

The Mules quickly stepped it up, however, and went on a 24-5 run beginning with a basket by junior Leeann Lanza.

“We applied full-court pressure and had a few defensive stops, so it was through teamwork that we were able to pull it out after that slow start, ” explained Zabrecky.

And the final box score certainly reflected that teamwork. All but two Muhlenberg players scored during the game, including double-digit efforts from sophomores Leanna Tallamy, Nicole Pepe and Emily Lesher.

Pepe and Lesher had 10 points each and Pepe grabbed a career-high seven rebounds and shot a perfect 6-for-6 from the charity stripe.

Senior Kate Clawson added nine points and classmate Julie Kelly and junior Katy Mitton scored eight apiece. Mitton also had a steal 34 seconds before halftime and got the ball up the court to Pepe for a layup that gave Muhlenberg a 24-point lead heading into the locker room.

“The team effort today was fantastic, ” stated Zabrecky. “It’s great to see all the people who don’t normally get to play a lot come in and play well. Those younger girls are going to be the ones starting and playing next year, so it’s very important for them to get experience and play in a game like the one today. ”




Zabrecky (#4) surrounded by her teammates following the game.



Tallamy led the team with a double-double, the first of her Muhlenberg career, scoring 16 points and grabbing 11 boards, eight of them on the offensive glass.

Zabrecky added 10 rebounds, helping the Mules to a lopsided 65-27 advantage on the glass. She also dished out five assists.

The Mules (7-3) shot 52.2 percent from the field, including 50.0 percent from behind the arc. They held Misericordia (5-2), who qualified for the NCAA Tournament last year, to a mere 18.0 percent shooting and just 2-for-20 from long range.

The team now has two weeks off for winter break and will resume action at home against McDaniel on January 5.

“Everyone is excited to go home for the holidays after finals, but we work out on our own and we’ll be ready to come back and play in the new year, ” added Zabrecky.

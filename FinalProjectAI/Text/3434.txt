muhlenberg wins matte award outright












When it came time to dress up the Matte Award for the 2008-09 school year, Muhlenberg believed ties were not in fashion.

A year after tying Moravian in the annual all-sports competition, Muhlenberg won the trophy outright with a final tally of 10½-7½. The Mules have owned the Matte Award
for six straight years.

Muhlenberg formally claimed the trophy in a recent luncheon attended by administrators, coaches and student-athletes from both schools.

The two Lehigh Valley rivals have competed for the Matte Award since 1988. It is named after the late Aaron Matte (Muhlenberg ’70), a strong supporter of local college
athletics.

Muhlenberg dominated in the fall, winning the first three contests and never looking back. The Mules clinched on April 22 when the men’s lacrosse and men’s golf
teams both won.

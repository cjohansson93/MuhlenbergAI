vansyckle earns repeat ncaa bid





Sophomore Bobby Torphy was the third runner across the line for the men’s team. 


Senior Timothy VanSyckle of the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team earned his third straight bid to the NCAA Championships by finishing seventh at the NCAA Mideast Regional, hosted by Waynesburg.

VanSyckle was a member of the Mule team that qualified in 2006 and made it as an individual last year. His seventh-place 
finish was the best ever by a Muhlenberg male runner at the regional meet, topping the 10th-place showing of current head coach Will Elson in 2002 and Alex Hotz in 2003.

Runners need to finish in the top 35 at the regional meet to make the all-region team, and VanSyckle did it for a third time, improving from 35th as a sophomore to 22nd to seventh. He also was on the freshman all-region team in 2005.

Van Syckle is the first Muhlenberg cross country runner to qualify for NCAAs twice as an individual, and the second may come on Sunday. Classmate David Chorney finished 20th (also earning all-region honors for the third time) and will make the NCAA field if the Haverford team receives an at-large bid. (Individual bids are awarded to the top runners on non-qualifying teams.)

The NCAA Championships are scheduled for next Saturday at Hanover College in Hanover, Ind.

The two seniors led Muhlenberg to a 10th-place finish out of 43 complete teams. It was the fifth consecutive top-10 finish for the Mules.

The Muhlenberg women came in 15th, their sixth straight year in the top 15. The Mules finished higher than one school (McDaniel) they trailed at the Centennial Conference Championships.

Sophomore Kate Mahoney paced the women in 26th place, becoming the first Mule sophomore to earn all-region honors since 2002.

Both Muhlenberg teams finished well ahead of Moravian. Factoring in the football loss, the Mules enter the winter season with a lead of 5½-2½ in the Matte Award standings.

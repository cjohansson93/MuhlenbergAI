The Muhlenberg men’s golf team took a rare trip south of Maryland this weekend and tied for 10th at the Roanoke Invitational.

The only team in the 14-school field not from Virginia, West Virginia or North Carolina, the Mules had the third-best improvement from the first round to the
second, cutting 10 strokes off their score.

Junior Christopher Lucarelli (left) and freshman Jonathan Graulich each finished at 161 to lead Muhlenberg. Lucarelli had the Mules’ low
round of the tournament, shooting a 79 in the second round.

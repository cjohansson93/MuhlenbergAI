Summer Study gives students the opportunity to take courses at convenient times and locations


Muhlenbergâs Summer Study Session I begins Wednesday, May 25 on-campus and online.

Many students find that summer classes afford them an opportunity to lighten fall and spring course loads and focus on subjects that demand significant attention. Others enjoy the chances to work, travel and volunteerâflexibility made possible when taking only one or two courses at a timeâor even the chance to take online classes from home.
Jennifer Coviello '18, a dance major who is also enrolled in Muhlenbergâs 3+3 physical therapy cooperative program with Thomas Jefferson University, is taking advantage of summer courses to stay ahead of a challenging curriculum.
"I love that you can concentrate on just one class in the summer," says Jennifer. "It's great being busy during the school year...but during the summer you can really focus on studying."
Summer Study allows students to enroll in up to four summer courses (no more than two per session), and five available sessions provide versatility for busy schedules. Courese are available on-campus and online, perfect for students staying local or learning from home.
Full-time Muhlenberg students should consult with their advisor prior to enrolling. Visiting students should consult with their home school advisor to confirm transfer of credits.
For more information, please visit the Summer Study website for course availability and application, or call the Wescoe School at 484-664-3300.

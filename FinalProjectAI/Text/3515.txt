WOMEN’S HOOPS ADVANCES WITH WIN


Sometimes to go forward, you have to go back. 






Piscadlo's seven assists gave her 163 for the season, just three short of
the Centennial Conference record.





The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team, facing an end to its dream
season, turned to pressure defense and mass substitutions – two of the
hallmarks of the Grinnell style it played two years ago – to come from
behind for a 57-50 win against Wesleyan in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.

In their fifth straight heart-stopping win, the Mules closed the game on
an 18-4 run to advance to the regional final agame against host Mary
Washington on Saturday at 8:00.

Except for two early ties, the Mules (26-2) trailed the entire game and
faced their biggest deficit, at 44-36 with 6:56 remaining, before
beginning their comeback.

A three-pointer by senior Kristen Piscadlo was answered by a layup
by Wesleyan, giving the Cardinals a 46-39 lead with 5:19 left. Wesleyan
(18-8) made only one field goal the rest of the game.

Just eight seconds after the Cardinal bucket, freshman Lauren Boyle
beat the defense down the court for a layup to make the score 46-41.
Wesleyan missed a quick jumper, and junior Meghan Courtney snagged





Smith finished with 11 points and six rebounds.





the rebound and dished off to Piscadlo, who threw a long downcourt pass to
senior Lacie Smith. She made the layup to pull the Mules to within
three.

“We knew that if we kept working hard and pushing the ball, we would
get them tired,” said Piscadlo. “So we just kept trying to fast
break.”

Muhlenberg got key minutes from its entire 11-player rotation and used its
fullcourt pressure to wear down the Cardinals, who used only seven players
in the second half.

After a Wesleyan turnover, Piscadlo drove the lane and tried a scoop shot.
She missed, but rebounded the ball under the basket and kicked it to
Courtney, whose jumper from the lane cut the gap to one.

With 3:09 left, after a missed Cardinal free throw, Boyle drove the
baseline for a layup that gave the Mules their first lead, 47-46. Piscadlo
then stole the ball near midcourt and drove in for a layup and a
three-point lead. Two Courtney free throws completed the 12-0 run that put
Muhlenberg up 51-46 with 2:30 to play.

A three-pointer drew Wesleyan to within 53-50, but senior Stephanie
Coluccini and Piscadlo each made a pair of free throws in the final 45
seconds to account for the final margin.

The Mules’ last five wins have come by a total of 18 points, and all
were decided in the last five minutes.

“We never lost our confidence,” said Piscadlo. &#147Every moment
that I had a chance to talk to the team I said, we&#146re not leaving here

without a victory. The faith we have in each other really got us
through.&#148
<P>
Boyle led all scorers with 18 points, shooting 7-of-11 from the field. She
has been Muhlenberg&#146s top scorer in all three of its postseason games,
hitting the go-ahead basket in two of them.

Piscadlo finished with 12 points and seven assists. Courtney made up for a
poor shooting night by pulling down 10 rebounds, helping the Mules to a
43-31 advantage on the boards.

Muhlenberg will take its second 11-game winning streak of the season into
the regional final.

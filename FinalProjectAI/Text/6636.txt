Senior Wrestlers Perfect 4-0 in Final Home Matches
 Sunday, February 10, 2013







					 



The two seniors on the Muhlenberg wrestling team, Matt Parker and Chris Galletta, closed out their home careers in fine fashion, both going 2-0 in duals against King’s and Mount St. Vincent.



A Mule win is the only thing that would have made the rare Sunday night matches better for the two seniors. Although Muhlenberg came as close to winning a dual match as it has in two years, Mount St. Vincent prevailed in the nightcap, 29-15. King’s took the opening match, 42-18.

Parker controlled his King’s opponent from the start, scoring a takedown 17 seconds into the match and recording a pair of near-falls in the first period, which ended with him ahead, 9-1. Parker finished off the match with his third pin of the season 18 seconds into the second period.

Galletta (left) was taken down 18 seconds into his heavyweight bout, but escaped quickly and needed only 1:39 to pin his opponent.

Muhlenberg sent seven wrestlers to the mat against Mount St. Vincent, a first-year program, with three bumping up a weight class to give the Mules the best chance at a win. 

After Che Chengsupanimit picked up a forfeit win at 141, 6-3, Parker moved up from 149 to 157 and won by 8-3 decision to put Muhlenberg ahead, 9-7, halfway through the match.


The Mules got a bad break at 165, when freshman Jimmy Coiley (right) was forced to default with just four seconds left in the second period.



 Coiley had opened up a 9-0 lead on the strength of two three-point near-falls in the first period and appeared to be on his way to earning Muhlenberg four team points before getting injured. The 10-point swing put the Dolphins ahead, 13-9, and they added 16 points at the next three weight classes.

Galletta put on a thoroughly dominant performance in the final bout of the night, building a 15-2 lead on three takedowns and three near-falls fewer than two minutes after the opening whistle. He flattened his overmatched opponent at the 2:18 mark for his team-leading eighth pin of the season.

The home matches concluded a busy weekend of wrestling for the Mules. On Saturday, they traveled by Baltimore to take on Centennial Conference foes Merchant Marine and Johns Hopkins. Galletta recorded a pin in just 78 seconds in a 45-6 loss to Merchant Marine, but Muhlenberg was blanked 49-0 by the hosts.

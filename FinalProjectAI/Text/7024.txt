The Buttermaker Story
     
The 1990 Muhlenberg volleyball team was a very
young but promising group. Comprised mostly of freshmen,
the team worked extremely hard but met with lots
of frustration and disappointment during the early
part of the season.

In an effort to keep their morale up, and to point
out the necessity of continuing to work hard and
thus ultimately achieve success, Coach Frank
Marino told them the following story:

There was once a group of frogs who happened upon a large vat of milk.
Seeing an opportunity for fun, they jumped into the vat and began to frolic.
Unfortunately, the edge of the vat was shaped in a curved way that allowed for
easy entry but impossible exit.

The frogs swam frantically about and tried hard to escape from the vat. Eventually
all but one frog grew exhausted, sank to the bottom and perished.
The remaining frog continued to kick and kick until the milk solidified and
was turned to butter. The frog was therefore able to climb out of the vat and
survive.

The obvious moral of the story was if you keep kicking and trying, you will
eventually succeed.

That group of freshmen went on to set the College record for wins. Further, of the seven who were freshmen at that time, five
made Dean’s List every semester and three were Phi Beta Kappa.
The group came to be known as the “Buttermakers” and established traditions
of excellence and pride which succeeding teams strive to maintain. The program
holds a tournament every year named in their honor.

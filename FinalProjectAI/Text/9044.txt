Related Campus Activities Local Events Sustainability Program Statement Campus Corner
The concept of sustainability has emerged in many different disciplines as a way to discuss consumption and production from a perspective broad enough to include respect for cultural values, natural resources and humane practices. The Center for Ethics invites critical reflection on the strengths and limits of sustainability through its Fall 2003 programming, Sustainable Communities: Balancing Economy, Ecology and Justice.
Through interactive programming, presentations and classroom activities, the Center encourages investigation of social practices in our local college community, as American citizens and across diverse cultures. Questions to be raised include: How is sustainability to be defined and measured? How do practices change if sustainability is introduced as a value? Is sustainability anthropocentric in ways that leave the environment vulnerable? What is the relationship between resource consumption in the developed world and underdevelopment elsewhere? To what extent do our campus practices contribute to, or detract from, sustainability?
All events, unless otherwise noted, are free and open to the public

Wednesday, September 10 â¢ 7:00pmâ¢ Miller Forum, Moyer Hall This 55-minute documentary chronicles the work of architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart, whose worked helped to bring more environmentally friendly design and practices to industries such as Nike, Ford Motor Company, Design Tex and Oberlin College.

Richard Matthews: "The earth belongs in usufruct to the living": Jeffersonian Values for the 21st Century Tuesday, September 16 â¢ 7:00 p.m.â¢ Lithgow auditorium, Trumbower NEH Distinguished Professor in the department of Political Science at Lehigh University, Professor Matthews will discuss how the Jeffersonian vision of a democratic community circles around his radical theory that "the earth belongs in usufruct to the living." Implicitly ecological at its core, Jefferson's "utopian" notions offer contemporary Americans ways to think about politics, government, and what it means to be human that stand as an indictment of the American conception of the good life. Americans may well quote "The Declaration of Independence," but we live The Federalist.

Other speakers will be announced soon. Reception follows.

 "Displacement: Photographs by Edward Burtynsky and Camilo Jose Vergara" Photographic exhibit curated by Professor Joseph Elliott, Art department, hosted by the Martin Art Gallery January 29 thru April 15 â¢ Martin Art Gallery Exhibit features work of photographers who observe the human impact on the land. The history of landscape photography is rich in examples of photographers who chose to depict the natural environment in its monumental purity, or who chose to glorify the urban splendor of the twentieth century city. On the other hand there are many photographers who have used the visual power of the photograph to examine critically the effects of human activity on the natural environment. Although they all hold strong opinions about the landscape and how it has been affected, this group tends to work rather dispassionately, almost as surveyors, gathering visual information and presenting it clearly. If they have integrity as works of art, the photographs resulting from such a critical approach can often be perceived and responded to in several ways. On one hand they can provide powerful and persuasive evidence of damaging and unsustainable effects of human activity, thus providing a rationale for change. The prints can be stunning, some as large as 40 x 50 inches. On the other hand, the visually attractive elements that motivated the photographer, or the formal beauty of the finished artifact may leave the viewer with a more conflicted response. How can such beautiful objects be presenting us with such difficult information?

Dr. William Jennings, Emeritus Professsor of Religion, Muhlenberg College. "Sustainability and New Ideas about God" Tuesday, February 3 â¢ Moyer Hall, Miller Forum â¢ 7:30 - 9:30 p.m Dr. Jennings describes the lecture in this way..."Christians face critics today who say that Christianity is partly responsible for today's ecological crisis because of its focus on the supernatural rather than the natural and its concerns for humans, history and salvation rather than the natural world. Recognizing some truth in these challenges, some Christian thinkers today argue for 'the greening of theology', with ideas which put God in the world rather than apart and which see Christ in all aspects of the physical universe". This lecture is sponsored by the Chapel and the Lutz Lecture Fund. Two student respondents will comment after the lecture.

Brian Snyder: "Local Agriculture as National Defense:  The Cuban Experience" Monday, March 29  â¢ Hoffman House â¢  5:45-7:00 p.m. Brian Snyder, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture, will present a slide show that explores the rise of sustainable agricultural techniques in Cuba, much of which can be attributed to the long-standing United States trade embargo against Cuba.  In his article entitled âAn Excursion through Cuba:  A Clue to Our Future?,â Snyder notes that given the economic crisis that has resulted from the embargo, Cubans have come to see the soil of their country as an important âstrategic natural resource.â  He then wonders, âWill it take a crisis of similar proportions in the United States before our people understand?â 
 
Theatrical Performance by Muhlenberg students under the direction of Professor Beth Schachter Spring 2004 â¢ date and location TBA Why do SUV's exist? Who is driving a Hum Vee on the narrow streets of Manhattan? Frankly, if not in one of our many combat areas around the world, why drive one at all? It is all right to eat Tyson chicken when the company is trying to roll back workers wages from $11 to $9 an hour? Where does the Muhlenberg chicken come from? And, actually, why is it okay to eat another animal? As the PETA people, say, "Does Your Food Have a Face?" These are a few of the questions a group of students will be exploring with Assistant Professor Beth Schachter in a new piece to be created during the fall semester. The students will conduct interviews, make videotapes, research issues and come together to create a theatre piece about sustainability as it resonates with our local community.

Sustainability Program Statement from the Science Sustainability Committee July 18, 2003 (This statement was drafted by the Sustainability Committee for consideration in the planning of the new science facilities on campus.)
As a member of the Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future, Muhlenberg College is committed to advancing environmental literacy. The design and construction of new science facilities provides the college with a unique opportunity to educate our students and the community about sustainability. Our new facilities will be a model of environmentally-sound construction. Incorporating passive solar design and energy conservation measures reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Using local and recycled materials requires less consumption of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Building with wood from sustainably-managed forests contributes to forest conservation. Careful choosing of building materials can help preserve biodiversity. In so doing, this building will not only house our science program, but will become integral to our teaching. It will serve as a laboratory for investigating sustainability and as a model for how science can be applied to solve our earth's problems. Muhlenberg students will be involved in analysis and planning of the building and renovations, and in evaluation of the building performance after occupation. These green facilities will enhance community outreach programs and serve as a model for other colleges. This innovative approach will attract donors interested in being on the cutting edge of campus sustainability initiatives, and appeal to prospective students. In addition to these benefits, the new facilities will be less expensive to operate over time and pay back any extra cost involved in the construction. Information on green design and building practices are available from many organizations including the US Green Building Council and the Sustainable Campus Initiative.

Football Sets Up Showdown with Shutout of McDaniel

The press box at the newly christened Kenneth Gill Stadium, home of the McDaniel football team, is still under construction and wasn’t completely ready for the first home game. The first visiting team to play at the renovated stadium, however, was quite ready.

Dan Deighan rushed for two first-quarter touchdowns and the defense pitched its second straight shutout as the Muhlenberg football team improved to 3-0 with a 33-0 win, spoiling the Green Terror’s home opener.




Senior Tim Vogel (7) picked off his first pass of the season on the first play after a long McDaniel kickoff return. 


The victory sets up a showdown with defending Centennial Conference champion Johns Hopkins (also 3-0) next Saturday at Scotty Wood Stadium.

The defense allowed only 168 total yards, registered six sacks and intercepted two passes. Coming on the heels of last weeks 21-0 whitewashing of Franklin & Marshall, it is the first time the Mules have recorded back-to-back shutouts since 2007. It also is the first time ever that Muhlenberg blanked its first two CC opponents of the season.

Junior Kory Crichton led the defense with 11 tackles, while junior Andrew Onimus recorded 10. Each notched a sack. Sophomore Jeremy Thomas, making his first career start, had 1½ sacks.




Dandridge rushed for 94 of his 100 yards in the second half, including 28 on a 91-yard drive that ended with a field goal.


After two near-misses (94 and 99 yards in the first two games), senior Terrence Dandridge recorded his 12th career 100-yard game with an even 100 on 19 carries. Deighan rushed for 91 yards on only eight carries, passed for 158 yards and a touchdown and punted twice for a 42.5-yard average.

“We were all over them on defense,” said Crichton. “And the offense and defense were clicking, which leads to good things.”

 Muhlenberg started its first possession at the 16 and needed 11 plays to march down the field for the game’s opening score. Deighan completed a 21-yard pass to senior Isaiah Vaughn on third-and-6, then ran it in from 28 yards out on another third-and-6.

After the Mule defense forced a three-and-out, senior John Gruver returned the ensuing punt 29 yards to the Green Terror 24. Deighan took it down to the 1 on the next play, then sneaked in to make it 14-0 with 3:26 left in the first quarter.

McDaniel’s only serious scoring chance came on the next drive. On fourth down from the 5, however, the Green Terror tried a fake field goal, and junior Peter Sorrento tackled the holder for a 13-yard loss.


Muhlenberg made it 16-0 early in the third quarter when a high snap on a McDaniel punt was kicked out of the end zone for a safety. Gruver returned the free kick 36 yards, and five plays later Deighan hit senior Marcus Toomey from 9 yards out to extend the lead to 23-0.

A 24-yard field goal by sophomore Connor Winter and a 2-yard run by junior Joe Carlucci gave the Mules 10 fourth-quarter points.

Muhlenberg has shut out McDaniel in three of the last six years and won three straight games in Westminster after going winless there from 1990 to 2006.

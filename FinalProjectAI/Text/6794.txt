Tennis Teams Sweep McDaniel
 Saturday, April 13, 2013 - page 2







					 




Although both Muhlenberg tennis teams were hosting McDaniel in their lone combined Saturday home match of the year, it was Senior Day for the women but not the men.



Why? Very simple – there are no seniors on the men’s team.

Both teams made the day a productive one, as seniors combined for three points in an 8-1 win by the women, and the senior-less men overcame a 2-1 deficit after doubles play to defeated the Green Terror for the 30th straight time, 6-3.



Senior Jessica Klein (left), who returned to the Mules this year after taking her sophomore year off due to injury and studying abroad last spring, picked up her first career singles win in straight sets at No. 6. Senior Amanda von Taube lost only four games in winning at No. 2 doubles and No. 4 singles.

The Mules’ third senior, Lauren Barnett, is not playing this spring.

Juniors Emily Szulman and Gabriela Contino both posted 6-0, 6-0 shutouts in singles play as Muhlenberg enjoyed a less stressful day following three straight 5-4 matches.

The men, who started three sophomores and a freshman in their singles lineup, dropped first and third doubles in close 9-7 matches. In between, junior Jason Teitelbaum and sophomore Eric Chavis breezed to an 8-0 win at No. 2 doubles.

The Mules avoided their first loss to McDaniel since 1982 by winning five of six singles matches, including a 6-0, 6-0 shutout by junior Ben Berkowitz at No. 4. Teitelbaum, Chavis and sophomore Daniel Lakhman all won in straight sets, and sophomore Keith Beizer (right) came back after dropping the first set to win a third-set supertiebreaker.

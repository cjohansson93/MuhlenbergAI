track teams make mostof last chance


In their final competition before the NCAA Championships, the Muhlenberg track and field teams produced three national qualifiers and broke two school records at the Swarthmore Last Chance Meet.

Junior Alex Faust clinched her second trip to the NCAA Championships this year by hitting the automatic qualifying standard of 12-6¼ in the pole vault. Fausts previous mark of 12-3½ would probably have gotten her into the national meet anyway, but she removed all doubt, joining Sarah Mitchell (2007, javelin) as the only female athletes in Mule history to qualify automatically. 

Through meets of the weekend, only six Division III athletes had cleared the automatic standard. Fausts height also broke her own school and Centennial Conference records; she has raised both almost a foot and a half from 11-1¾ at the start of the season.

Muhlenberg’s other two qualifiers hit provisional marks. Senior David Chorney, who came into the week ranked seventh in the steeplechase on the Division III performance list, added his name to the list in the 1,500 by running a 3:51.98 to break a school record set in 2003. The time puts Chorney 11th on the performance list.

Junior Jennifer Lynch (left) also qualified provisionally in the 1,500, clocking in at 4:38.61.

Freshman Marc Brookland placed fifth in the triple jump in a meet that included 35 schools from all three NCAA divisions. Senior Evan Sheppard, in the final meet of his career, was sixth in the shot put.

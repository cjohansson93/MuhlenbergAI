Dr. James Russell 
Assistant Professor of StatisticsEducation
B.A., College of the Holy Cross Ph.D.The Pennsylvania State University

Background
I recently started at Muhlenberg College after earning my Ph.D. in statistics from Penn State University during the Summer of 2016. The goal of my research is to develop new statistical techniques to enable scientists to answer questions that are relevant to real-world applications. I am particularly interested in spatial statistics, statistical computing, and statistics education. My current work focuses on developing models and inferential methods to analyze the collective movement dynamics of groups of animals so that we can gain a better understanding of the spread of infectious disease through societies.  In my free time, I can be found in local parks with my dog Wilson, playing soccer, or supporting my hometown Boston sports teams, especially the New England Patriots.

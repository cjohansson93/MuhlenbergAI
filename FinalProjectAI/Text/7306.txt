Women's Basketball Shot Down at Swarthmore
 Thursday, January 16, 2014







					 





Senior Colleen Caldwell had a "quadruple-triple," with 3 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals.




The long ball made all the difference as the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team suffered a 67-61 defeat at Swarthmore in the rematch of an overtime thriller.

The Garnet knocked down nine three-pointers – five of them by one player – to just three for the Mules, and that was enough to squeak by in an evenly matched affair featuring seven ties and 10 lead changes. Junior Leanna Tallamy led all scorers with 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting for Muhlenberg (7-7, 4-4), which saw its two-game winning streak snapped. Senior co-captain Leeann Lanza matched a career high with 14 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for the sixth double-double of her career, and her second against Swarthmore (8-6, 3-5) this season.

Muhlenberg eked out a 75-74 victory on a baseline jumper by Lanza with 22 seconds remaining in overtime in the teams’ Centennial Conference opener. After a first half in which the lead changed hands 10 times and ended with Swarthmore clinging to a 36-34 lead, it looked like another marathon could be in the works.

The Mules forged a tie for the final time when Lanza put back her own miss two minutes into the second half, but the Garnet took control with a 9-1 run that gave them a 52-43 advantage with 12:13 to play. Muhlenberg pulled to within four twice from there, but would get no closer as Swarthmore earned a split of the season series. 

Despite shooting just 35.5 percent from the field, Swarthmore kept the Mules at bay with timely three-pointers down the stretch. The Garnet, who came in leading the CC in three-pointers made and attempted, launched 32 shots from distance and got just enough of them to fall, while Muhlenberg finished 3-of-17 (17.6 percent) from behind the line in coming up just short.

	 Monday, January 14, 2013  09:58 AM

His talk, “Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression,” is free and open to the public.
Burgin received his Ph.D. at Harvard University andspent a year as a visitingscholar atthe American Academy of Arts and Sciences before joining thefaculty of Johns Hopkins University in 2010.  His research and teaching focuses on the issues at the intersection of ideas, politics and markets in the UnitedStates and the Atlantic world since the late nineteenth century.  Burgin’s book, The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Great Depression, was published by Harvard University Press in October 2012.  It presents a compelling intellectual history of the evolution of postwar economic thought.
Market\Values is co-directed by Sue Curry Jansen, professor of media and communications, Mohsin Hashim, associate professor of political science, and Marcia Morgan, assistant professor of philosophy.  This year-long program examines historical and contemporary questions about markets and accompanying moral issues they raise. The goal of the Center for Ethics’ programming is to engage the community in intensive and reflective thinking about individual and collective values.

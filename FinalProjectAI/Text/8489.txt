Every spring, the Sedehi Diversity Project puts together an ensemble of students drawn from all corners of the campus community to create the annual SDP documentary play. Think you might want to be part of that ensemble? If so, we want to talk to you.We're seeking current Muhlenberg students, with or without performance experience, who are passionate about conversations about diversity and multiculturalism. The application process happens annually in the early spring. If you'd like to be notified about how to apply, just submit your info below and we'll make sure you're kept in the loop!

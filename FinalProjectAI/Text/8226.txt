The Dana Forum is designed as a senior year capstone experience to deepen a greater sense of community among DANA scholars, and to enrich the intellectual climate on campus. Each year the Forum helps Dana seniors develop and execute collaborative research projects that are tied to the Center for Ethicâs annual theme. In the Fall semester, Dana seniors enroll in a 0.5 credit class, where they study literature related to the Center for Ethicsâ theme for that given year. By the end of the Fall semester, students form groups of three or four to research a topic of their choice and identify a faculty mentor for the project. The research component of the Dana Forum is completed during the spring semester of the senior year.

football staff adds former lehigh asst.


Muhlenberg hired Trey Brown, who has more than 10 years of 




Division I football coaching experience, as quarterbacks and wide receivers coach and special teams coordinator.

Brown replaces Jeff Knarr, who left recently to become head coach at King’s, on the Mule staff. 
Tom Perkovich, the special teams coordinator last year, will assume the role of offensive coordinator.

For the last four years, Brown was offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Lehigh University. The Mountain Hawk offense scored 30 or more points 15 times during his tenure and led the Patriot League in scoring in 2006, when its quarterback was named to the All-Patriot League first team. 

Brown coordinated an offense that averaged 32.3 points in league games in 2008 and 27.3 points in 2009. Lehigh scored more than 80 percent of the time it reached the Red Zone both seasons, including a Patriot League-best 87.9-percent efficiency in 2008.

Before coming to the Lehigh Valley, Brown spent one year with the tight ends and four with the wide receivers at the University of Pennsylvania, where he coached the two most prolific receivers in program history. The Quakers were a combined 40-9 during Brown’s stint and won Ivy League championships in 2002 and 2003.

Prior to his arrival at Penn, Brown spent three seasons as an assistant coach at Stanford University. Brown was part of the 1999 staff named the coaching staff of the year by the Pacific-10 conference after that squad captured a Pac 10 title. The Cardinal boasted an offense that was recognized in the top 10 nationally, and the team appeared in the 2000 Rose Bowl.

A native of Longmont, Colo., Brown earned his bachelor’s in marketing from the University of Colorado in 1993. He added a master’s in sports administration from Saint Mary’s (Calif.) College in 2003.

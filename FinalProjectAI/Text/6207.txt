A deep and balanced Muhlenberg women’s basketball team enjoyed a historic night in a 115-43 win at Bryn Mawr.

The 13th-ranked Mules tied the school record with their 72-point margin of victory, matching an 89-17 win against Bryn Mawr 11 years ago. Muhlenberg (8-0, 4-0) also set a school record with 37 steals.

Among other notables:
• The 65 points the Mules scored in the second half were the second-most in a half in team history.
• Muhlenberg tied for the second-most field goals made (44) and made the fifth-most three-pointers (15).
• The Mules reached the century mark for the 13th time, scoring the fourth-most points in their history.

All 17 healthy players saw action in the first half, and all but two scored in the game. Only two players were on the court for more than 15 minutes.

Several players stood out in their first extended varsity action. Freshman Abby Stenger (left), who came in having played 13 minutes all year, poured in 20 points in just 15 minutes. She made six three-pointers.

Two other freshmen, Laura Gregory and Nicole Pepe, scored 12 points in 14 minutes apiece. Gregory had scored seven points on the season coming into the game, Pepe five.

Junior Julie Kelly netted 12 points in only six minutes. Senior Kimberly Mui played just five minutes but recorded five steals and scored four points.

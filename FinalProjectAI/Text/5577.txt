women’s lacrosse ties wins record



It’s not necessary to dig a long time in the record books to come to the conclusion that the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team is riding on its most successful campaign ... ever.

The Mules (10-3, 5-3) claimed another remarkable success in the Centennial Conference, 



Junior Megan Wilson scored a goal in each half.



defeating 17-10 Swarthmore and earning an unprecedented fifth league victory. 

The players foretaste the first-ever CC playoff berth, which could be clinched next Saturday when the team entertains McDaniel in its last conference encounter. 
With two regular-season games remaining, the Mules won their 10th success on the season, tying their school record for wins in a campaign set in 2006 when they finished 10-6. 

Against Swarthmore, freshman Rachael Goldstein exploded with a career-high six goals for Muhlenberg, bringing her season tally to 23. She demonstrated prominent efficiency, converting all her shots on the day.

Swarthmore opened a 4-1 lead in the opening stages only to waken up the beast in the Mules, who responded with seven goals in a row to establish an 8-4 cushion.

The two teams entered halftime with Muhlenberg on top, 9-6. The Garnet attempted a quick comeback in the second half with two goals in the first three minutes, but the rampant Mules reacted with five unanswered goals to make the score 14-8 midway through the period. 

For third time this year, senior Taylor Armstrong dished out at least five assists. She also contributed two goals, bringing her season point total to 69, the second-best in team history. Additionally, Armstrong moved into second place on the program’s all-time assists list with 78 in her career.

The team totaled seven assists in the game to raise its season total to a school-record 110, eclipsing the mark of 109 set in three more games in 2006.

Junior Sara Hiller pitched in a hat trick to become the third Mule this season to reach the 100-point mark. Sophomore Amanda McGovern also scored three goals, and sophomore Alyssa Bascelli finished with a team-leading six ground balls and one goal.  

The Mules have now won six of their last seven matches with the only loss down the stretch coming against national powerhouse Franklin & Marshall.

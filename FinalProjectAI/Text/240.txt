Interested in connecting with communities and important issues through your classes? Then these are the courses for you!
In some courses you will do projects, some youâll connect with community members to achieve common goals, and in some cases youâll do both! In all of these classes you will connect course content with community work in ways that complement your education and address community goals.
Check the course catalog ânotesâ section to see which courses are connected with community in any given semester, but here are a few examples:

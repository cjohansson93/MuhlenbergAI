On the heels of the most successful season in program history, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team is ranked 10th in the D3hoops.com preseason poll — not far  
from the Mules’ highest national ranking ever.

Muhlenberg graduated two starters but returns nine letterwinners from a squad that went 26-4 and won a second straight Centennial Conference championship last year.
In addition to becoming the first team to go undefeated through the CC regular and postseasons, the Mules  won two games in the NCAA Tournament to advance to the
“Sweet 16” for the first time ever.

This is the third time Muhlenberg has appeared in the D3hoops.com preseason top 25. The Mules were rated 20th prior to the start of the 2002-03 season and 24th last year.
They also received votes in the 2006-07 preseason poll. 

The highest preseason ranking in program history came in 1997, when Muhlenberg was tabbed ninth by College Sports magazine. 
The team’s highest regular-season ranking was No. 8 (by D3hoops.com) in January 2002. 

Some familiar names appear in the top 15. Moravian and Marymount, who handed the Mules two of their three regular-season losses last year, are ranked No. 15 and No. 20, 
respectively. Brandeis, which ended Muhlenberg’s season in the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament, is No. 9, and Bowdoin, the team the Mules beat to reach
the “Sweet 16,” is No. 7.

Scranton is ranked No. 5 in the preseason poll, which could make for a terrific Scotty Wood Tournament final if both teams get past their first-round games. The Mules
open up with Pitt-Bradford (11-14 last year), while the Royals are slated to take on Alvernia (18-10 with a win against Muhlenberg) in their opening games on Friday, November 20.

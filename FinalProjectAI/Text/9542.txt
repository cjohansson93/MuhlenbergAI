Allentown, PA (Nov. 8, 2019) â Six talented Muhlenberg College senior directing students will present their work as part of Muhlenbergâs âNew Voices | New Visionsâ Festival, an annual showcase for directors and playwrights, featuring groundbreaking and innovative short plays.
Four plays will be presented together in a single evening, Nov. 20-24, in Muhlenbergâs Studio Theatre, in the Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance. The evening includes two world premiere plays written by Muhlenberg students Patrick Daly â20 and Caroline Dunn â21, as well as short plays by established playwrights Kenneth Lonergan and JosÃ© Rivera.
The fifth show will be offered in a new late-night slot and will feature selections from The Neo-Futuristsâ avant-garde audience participation show âToo Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind.â Tickets for this performance are sold separately.
âThe festival is an opportunity for our student directors to work in a fully produced environment,â says Charles Richter, the festivalâs artistic director. âAll directors have a strong sense of concept. They have very specific creative visions for their plays and know how to present them to contemporary audiences.â
 

 
âFamily Valuesâ looks inside a mid-â90s sitcom, where raw emotions fight for attention beneath laugh-track superficiality.
Playwright Patrick Daly says he initially wrote the play as a passion project to explore the American sitcom. He says he was fascinated to find clips on YouTube of beloved sitcoms like âFriendsâ or âFull Houseâ â but without the laugh track.
âI didnât understand why people liked sitcoms so much,â Daly says. âWithout the laugh track, everything just sounds really sad.â
Daly says he has enjoyed the process of collaborating with director Nora Germani.
âShe has a wonderful grasp of little details I would have never considered while writing the script,â he says.
Germani has a long history of directing student-written work, including her own. Through her non-profit, student-run theatre company, Black Tie Productions, she has been involved in writing and directing two full-length musicals, âRepriseâ and âEmerald City.â
Germani says âFamily Valuesâ is the first live theater productions sheâs aware of that features a pre-recorded laugh-track. She says sheâs looking forward to seeing how it affects the reactions of a live audience.
âThe play is about trying to understand your family when you just canât,â she says. âItâs much darker than a typical sitcom.â
 

 
âBeauty Runs on Light Feet,â offers a compelling snapshot of family life, in which a husband and wife struggle painfully to express what matters most. 
Playwright Kenneth Lonergan won an Academy Award in 2017 for his screenplay for  âManchester by the Sea.â The revival of his play âThe Waverly Galleryâ was nominated for a Tony Award in 2018.
âLongergan is able to capture human complexity in such a compelling way,â Wahba says. âHeâs a naturalistic writer. Iâm drawn to plays that depict realistic behavior.â
Wahba says that Lonerganâs hyper-realistic writing style demands spontaneity from the actors. 
âThey continue to surprise me at every rehearsal,â he says. âThey arenât afraid to challenge each other and take risks.â
Wahba has worked with Axelrod Performing Arts Center, a regional theatre in New Jersey, for the past three summers. He also served as assistant director of âUbu Roiâ at Muhlenberg in the spring of 2018. 
âI am inviting the audience into a bedroom as a private moment is shared between two people,â he says. âWe are embracing the discomfort of this private conversation, to demonstrate the unsettling side to love.â
 

 
âHoly Sh*tâ pits a single mother against her old nemesis, the nun in charge of her daughter's school, and asks whatever happened to good old Catholic forgiveness.
âIt comes down to a sort of verbal tennis match between the characters,â says playwright Caroline Dunn.
After growing up in the Catholic school system, Dunn says she was interested in exposing the hypocrisy she observed in some leaders of the Catholic church.
âThis was my way of retorting back to them to practice what you preach,â she says.
Dunn is involved in standup comedy, improv and sketch groups on campus. She wrote âHoly Sh*tâ in an Intro to Playwriting course; it is the first play she ever wrote.
Dunn and director Heather Nielsen were brought together by their passion for producing work that highlights the female experience.
âItâs an entirely female-identifying team: the playwright, director and actors,â Nielsen says. âWomenâs voices need to be heard more, and Iâm excited to be contributing to that.â
Last spring, Nielsen directed the play âMy California,â which also featured an all-female cast.
âIt wasnât until I started working with all-female casts and playwrights that I found my niche,â she says.
 

 
âLessons for an Unaccustomed Brideâ follows a naive young bride-to-be as she seeks help from the town witch, who knows more than the girl expected.
Playwright JosÃ© Rivera incorporates his experience as a Puerto Rican artist into his work. His plays often emphasize family, sexuality and spirituality.
Director Frederick Marte has been working with the actors to highlight the playâs elements of magical realism. Although the play is written for just two characters, Marte cast an ensemble of actors who help create the playâs spiritual and supernatural world through movement and music.
âThe actors embody spirituality in themselves,â Marte says. âI have the ensemble embodying two clashing belief systems.â
Marte says the language within the play itself has a musicality to it. The actors have been working with dialect coach Roger Ainslie to help them with their accents and with the rhythms of the play.
âBoth of the actors already speak Spanish so they understand the cultural aspects of what they are saying,â Marte says.
Marte studied abroad for the past year in the Dominican Republic, which has a strong tradition of devised theatre. From this immersive experience, he has crafted a prologue for the production â an independent piece of performance art that responds to Riveraâs published work.
âWeâre talking about something that is so relevant, despite the fact that it is taking place in a different location and time,â he says. âMany people have a hard time having discussions with those with different views or values; this play navigates through that.â
 

 
âToo Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind,â by the Neo-Futurists, a Chicago-based experimental theater group, will be presented as a separate âAfter Hoursâ event â an avant-garde theatrical performance, in which the action on stage is determined by the luck of the draw.
Audience members select short plays at random, to be performed from a repertoire of 30 possibilities. The plays range from existential slapstick to soul-baring monologue. 
âItâs an hour-long theatrical marathon,â says co-director Ben Goldberg. âWeâre going to see how many of them we can get through. Each night the order of performance will depend on what the audience picks.â
âToo Much Lightâ will be presented Thursday through Saturday at 11 p.m. Shows at 5 and 8 p.m. will be offered on Sunday, Nov. 24, for those who want to see the late-night show without the late night.
Co-director Matt Beaune says the plays vary wildly.
âThereâs one called âBlind Date,â where the premise is that a performer is blindfolded and goes on a date with an audience member,â Beaune says. âBut thereâs also one called âThe Pitter Patter of Tiny Feet,â where a man mourns the death of his hypothetical child after his wife fails a pregnancy test.â
Beaune says that Muhlenberg has a culture of late-night performances, owing to many a cappella and improv groups performing in the wee hours. 
âThis connects us to the work,â Beaune says. âThe creators of the plays, the Neo-Futurists, often perform their work at late-night shows, so this worked out perfectly.â
Goldberg and Beaune are working separately with casts of eight performers, who will eventually unite when the show opens. 
 
âWhile we direct separately, we have a unified vision,â Beaune says. âWeâre asking for honesty â from the performers and the audience.â
 
The directors say the show is sort of like alien sketch comedy â sometimes funny, more thought-provoking than you expect, sometimes hitting close to home.
 
âDo you like âSaturday Night Liveâ?â Goldberg says. âBecause itâs nothing like that.â

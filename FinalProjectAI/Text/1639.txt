311’s humble beginnings where in Omaha, Nebraska where the four members of the band, Nick Hexum, Tim Mahoney, Chad Sexton, P-Nut and SA Martinez grew up and went to high school. They released their first album, “Music” to little fanfare in February of 1993. This and its follow up album “Grassroots” have since gone gold. Yet it was not until their third album “311” did the band truly capture the attention the music world. With two Billboard Top Ten Songs, “Down” and “All Mixed Up,” “311” went triple-platinum and put the band in the national spotlight.
Following the success of “311” the band followed up with another platinum recording, “Transistor,” which debuted at number four on the BillBoard Top 40. 311 has since gone on to record several other albums and recently dropped their newest work, “Don’t Tread on Me” which is their eighth studio album.
In recent years, Muhlenberg’s Memorial Hall has hosted other standout musical acts, including Counting Crows, Live, Smashmouth, Jason Mraz, O.A.R and Gavin DeGraw.

VOLLEYBALL ENDS LONG DAY WITH SPLIT



Men’s Tennis Competes at ITAs


Four Muhlenberg men’s tennis players competed at the ITA Southeast Regional at Mary Washington.

The doubles team of freshmen Wayne Mitchel and Jason Kirschenbaum won a first-round consolation match in the B3 doubles draw and will play in the consolation semifinals
on Sunday. All four players have singles consolation matches scheduled for Sunday.

Sophomore Phylicia Lee notched her first double-double of the season with 14 kills and 21 digs against Widener.



By the time the members of the Muhlenberg volleyball team finished playing their second Homecoming match, they must have felt like they were at their fifth reunion.

The Mules rebounded to defeat Widener, 3-1, after losing their Centennial Conference match to Dickinson in five games. In between, Widener beat Dickinson in four games. The
competition began at noon and didn’t end until almost 8:00.

Defense was the key to the Widener match, as Muhlenberg (7-12, 0-4) recorded 121 digs, eight short of the school record for a four-game match. Sophomore Christina 
Cangelosi led the Mules with a career-high 30 digs, while senior Megan Young (26) was among three other players with at least 20.

Sophomore Liz Dean led the attack with 15 kills, seven of which came in the fourth game, a 30-25 win. 

Muhlenberg played its fourth five-game match of the season against Dickinson, dropping the final two games after pulling out a 31-29 win in the third game. Senior
Jess Anselmi recorded a team-leading 12 kills, and sophomores Amy Cohen and Liz Dean had six blocks apiece.

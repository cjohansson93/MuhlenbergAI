Tough Day for Basketball Teams


The Muhlenberg basketball teams had a long day in Lancaster, as both were defeated by Franklin & Marshall.

In the opening game of the doubleheader, the women, playing on the road for the fourth time in eight days, lost 75-60 to snap their six-game winning streak. The
Diplomats (11-4, 6-2) scored the last 11 points of the first half to take a 33-29 lead at the break, then shot 57.9 percent in the second half to pull away.

Sophomore Alexis Bates led the Mules (11-4, 6-2) with 14 points, and junior Erin McSherry recorded a career-high 12 points, seven rebounds and five blocks.

The men’s game was much closer. F&M made three free throws in the last minute to break a 64-all tie and win, 67-64, sending the Mules (6-9, 4-4) to their third
straight loss.

Muhlenberg led most of the way and was up by four (64-60) with 4:33 to go, but went 0-for-4 from the field, 0-for-2 from the line and committed two turnovers the rest of the
way.

Junior Mike Bernardini led the Mules for the third game in a row with 18 points. Sophomore Ryan Foster added 15 points, and junior Darrell Roth had 11
points, three assists and three steals.

beating No. 9 Matt Shank from Gettysburg by a 6-4 decision in a matchup of two defending CC champions. Kein won last year at 141 and Shank at 149. The two met earlier this
season at the Messiah Petrofes Invitational, with Shank winning a 6-2 decision.

After winning his first bout by forfeit, Lavin secured an 8-2 victory against Johns Hopkins.

Junior Justin Fitch needed only 26 seconds to pin his Gettysburg opponent in the 174-pound division. Junior Matt Horn (184) didn’t remain long on the 
mat either, pinning down Drew Wohlenter in 48 seconds.

Senior Joe Tartar (heavyweight) and junior Billy Hall (141) recorded victories against Johns Hopkins wrestlers, winning 9-2 and 9-1 respectively.

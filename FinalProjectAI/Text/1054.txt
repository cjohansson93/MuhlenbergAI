Message to Study Abroad Students in Italy from President Harring
Saturday, February 29, 2020

Dear Students in Italy,
As you know, we have remained in constant contact with our host institutions in Italy. Together we have been monitoring the movement of the Coronavirus and continue to utilize all government (domestic and international) sources of information such as the CDC, and U.S. Department of State. As always, the safety of our students is a priority. 
We regret to inform you that yesterday evening, Friday, February 28, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 3 travel advisory for Italy, which means âReconsider Travel.â  Muhlenberg College strongly recommends that students LEAVE any country under a US Level 3 travel advisory. 
When choosing to study abroad, students signed a waiver (attached for your reference) acknowledging that the College neither endorses nor encourages them to participate in a program in a country subject to a U.S. Department of State Level 3 Travel Advisory. If you elect to continue to study in a country that now is subject to a Level 3 Travel Advisory issued by the U.S. government, you are assuming a substantial degree of risk.
If you elect to stay in your host country, the risks could include the following:

You may become ill with the virus.
Medical facilities and supplies may become overwhelmed.  
You may be quarantined in Italy beyond your program end date which means that you would have to find your own accommodations.
You may be quarantined upon arrival in the US. 

These risks would be at your own expense.
These extraordinary circumstances raise a number of questions regarding the programs you are enrolled in that we want to address. All of Muhlenbergâs host institutions in Italy have provided our students with the ability to continue their studies at home in the U.S. with online procedures or other means. You will receive a full semester of credits at the end of the semester assuming you complete the work remotely by all the due dates as if you were on-site. As a result, there are no refunds for either the educational program or the housing involved. Housing is not refundable since a replacement student cannot occupy the room based on the Italian Student Visa.
These are the next steps you need to take: 

You need to communicate your decision in writing by the deadlines given to you by your host institution as well as completing and submitting the required paperwork they provide.
If you decide to return to the U.S., you need to arrange your travels to leave the host institution according to the deadline or policies they have documented for you.
Students returning to the U.S. must return to their home address and not to Muhlenbergâs campus.
You must take all your belongings. There is no guarantee you can return later in the semester.
Notify your program your flight time, date and number. We recommend you avoid short layovers in case there is a mandatory medical check for flights arriving from Italy.

You continue to be in our thoughts as you work through these decisions with your family who will receive a copy of this message. We know how disappointing this news must be for all of you. We will be in regular communication with your programs and will update you if we learn more about the situation. 
Safe travels,
Kathleen Harring, Ph.D.Interim President

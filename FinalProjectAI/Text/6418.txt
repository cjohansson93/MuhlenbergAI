Baseball Banks Non-Conference Win vs. Centenary
 Sunday, April 1, 2012 - page 2







					 




Banks are closed on Sundays, but TD Bank Ballpark – the home of the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League – was open to host a college baseball game
between Muhlenberg and Centenary. And when the Mules have given the ball to junior Ryan Rechten with the game on the line this year, it’s
been like money in the bank.

Rechten retired both batters he faced in the bottom of the ninth to earn his seventh save (one short of the school record) and preserve Muhlenberg’s 7-3 win.

Freshman Nick Gies allowed no runs in 5 2/3 innings to earn the win in his first career start. Gies scattered seven hits and struck out three to 
become the fourth Mule freshman to start and win a game this season.


Senior Nick Busillo gave Muhlenberg (18-8) an early lead with a two-run single in the first. The game remained 2-0 until the seventh, when 
junior Joseph Vila (left) hit a two-run single.

After the Cyclones (10-14) scored two unearned runs in the bottom of the seventh, the Mules tacked on three runs in the eighth without hitting the ball out of the infield –
or much at all. They combined two hit batters, a walk, two wild pitches, a throwing error and an infield single to extend their lead to 7-2.

Centenary loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the ninth to put the tying run on deck when Rechten was summoned. He got a run-scoring groundout and a flyout
to end the game, giving the Muhlenberg bullpen its school-record ninth save of the season.

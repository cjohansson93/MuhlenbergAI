Fall 2018 Schedule
The 2018-2019 Center for Ethics, "Crisis Earth: Ethics of the Anthropocene" began on Friday, Sept. 7 with a series of interdisciplinary lectures and interactive lessons by Muhlenberg faculty on aspects of the Anthropocene.
A talk by James Hansen, titled âGlobal Energy, Climate and Health: Young Peopleâs Burdens and Opportunities,â followed. The program ran from 2:00â5:00 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum and surrounding classrooms. Hansen spoke from 3â4:30 p.m., followed by a reception.
A climatologist, activist, and one of the first to study global climate change, Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness, and Solutions at Columbia Universityâs Earth Institute. Fossil fuels provide a remarkably dense, convenient, form of energy. Their discovery powered the industrial revolution, spurred the elimination of slavery, and raised the standard of living of half the world. Unfortunately, fossil fuels also have consequences via their effects on human health and climate, consequences that are delayed and potentially devastating for young people if they are not addressed.
Also a former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Hansen is best known for his testimony on climate change in the 1980s that helped raise awareness of global warming. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and has received numerous awards, including the Sophie and Blue Planet Prizes. Hansen is recognized for speaking truth to power and for outlining actions needed to protect the future of young people and all species on the planet. Hansen may be joined by his granddaughter, Sophie Kivlehan, a plaintiff in the climate lawsuit brought by Our Childrenâs Trust against the US government.
Subsequent fall Center for Ethics events included:

D'Agostino has performed the Walks on six continents over the past five decades. Initiated as video 'documentation/performances' in 1973, the Walks evolved into video/web projects in the 1990s and mobile/locative media installations in the 2000s, probing and examining climate change during the last decade. World-Wide-Walks explore natural, cultural, virtual identities: mixed realities of walking through physical environments and virtually surfing the web.

His books include âSomething New Under the Sunâ (2000), listed by the London Times among the 10 best science books ever written (despite not being a science book); âThe Human Webâ (2003); and âMosquito Empiresâ (2010), which won the Beveridge Prize.

The Ethics of the Anthropocene: Crisis Earth2018-2019
The earth is experiencing an era of rapid environmental change. The impact of human activity is the dominant influence on the planetâs environment and can be found in the soil, water, air and rocks. Scientists have dubbed this new geological era the Anthropocene and are scrambling to understand how these changes affect ecosystems.  
Some businesses, communities, societies and political systems are responding to this change while others are not. Are these responses, or lack thereof, ethical? Who are the winners and losers as humans face down environmental catastrophe in the era of the Anthropocene? How can we face these environmental challenges ethically? When and why do we fail? The 2018-2019 Center for Ethics event series, The Ethics of the Anthropocene: Crisis Earth, explored the ethical implications of addressing the environmental damage that humankind has produced.

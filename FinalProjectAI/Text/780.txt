 Frames, Facts and Fears: Questioning Whether News Media Perpetuated the Social Stigmas Surrounding the HIV/AIDS Epidemic
 From the Black Death of the 14th century to the Spanish flu of the20th, stories of the devastation wrought by disease epidemics linger asreminders of the frailty of life and the power that illness has over man.It comes as no surprise, then, that issues of health and well-being maintain a strong presence in the media because of their continuing significance in daily life. Following the unannounced discovery of HIV/AIDSin the early 1980, news media ensured that HIV/AIDS would be thehealth story of the decade, combining culture, religion, and celebritywith medicine and relevanceânot to mention its undeniable connectionto sexuality and taboo. Nearly thirty years later, the epidemic has un-dergone a considerable amount of both print and broadcasting cover-age, and has since proved to be one of the most highly reported diseasesof all time. The potential for mediaâbe it news media or otherwiseâtoboth reflect and shape societal ideologies and perspectives raises con-cern and investigation into the stereotypes of HIV/AIDS: has our un-derstanding of HIV/AIDS been born from what we've read in the NewYork Times? This study of print new media considers the frames of race,gender, and language through which we've come to understand theidentity of HIV/AIDS.

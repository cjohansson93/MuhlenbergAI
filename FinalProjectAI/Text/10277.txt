Opening Panel - Exit West as a Form of Speech and Action
Panel Video Release - Sept. 18, 2020 (View video on the Center for Ethics Current Program webpage or video.muhlenberg.edu.)Live Webinar Discussion - Sept. 25, 2020 - Common Hour (Zoom link available 48 Hours prior to event; sign up here.)
In the hope that it may be possible to bring Mohsin Hamid to campus this year, after his spring 2020 visit was postponed, the College is once again using his novel, Exit West, as a campus reads text. We hope that many classes will choose to engage with this novel throughout the year. Our 2020-2021 program, Engaging in Speech and Action, will offer an opening panel that reads the novel, not so much through the lens of borders and identityâlast yearâs themeâbut as, itself, a form of speech and action. An opening panel of faculty will offer their reflections on the novel in a video discussion that will be publicly released on September 18, 2020. Then, on September 25, 2020, an open discussion will be held during Common Hour (2-3:15 p.m.) via Zoom.
Faculty Panelists:



Emanuela Kucik, English and Africana Studies


Mohsin Hashim, Political Science


Dawn Lonsinger, English


Leticia Robles-Moreno, Theatre and Dance


Mark Stein, History

"Engaging in Speech and Action" will continue into the Spring 2021 semester with group discussions of chapters from Kathryn Sophie Belleâs (formerly Kathryn Gines) monograph, Hannah Arendt and the Negro Question, and additional contemporary scholarship on engaging speech and action.
About "Engaging in Speech and Action"Hannah Arendt, following Aristotle, argued that the capacity to speak and act in the world constitutes distinctly human capabilities. Increasingly our moment, and our campus, is defined by growing concern about ways we impose on others and on ourselves limits to our capacity to speak and to act. In order to foster the capacity to speak and act in a time of increasing polarization, technological complexity and political uncertainty, this Center for Ethics program will support programs designed to engage the community in a series of events and development workshops that explicitly seek to build and foster speech and action.
About the Center for EthicsThrough thematic lectures and events, the Center for Ethics serves the teaching and study of the liberal arts at Muhlenberg College by providing opportunities for intensive conversation and thinking about the ethical dimensions of contemporary philosophical, political, economic, social, cultural, and scientific issues. In service to its mission, the Center for Ethics hosts special events and programs, provides faculty development opportunities, and provides support for student programming. The Center for Ethics and thematic programs are directed by full-time faculty members.
Brian Mello, associate professor of political science, serves as Center for Ethics director. Marcia Morgan, associate professor of philosophy, serves as this year's program director.

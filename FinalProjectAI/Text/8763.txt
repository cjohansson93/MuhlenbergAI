OIT Support of Remote Employees

Definitions
Muhlenberg College defines a Remote Employee as a full-time employee that does not have an office on campus, and works almost entirely out of a physically separate home or remote office. Such a remote employee may come to campus from time to time for extraordinary reasons, but does not otherwise work on campus.
Technology Provisions
Muhlenberg College provides a laptop for any employee with that needs to work outside of the office on a regular basis. This is funded through OIT as part of the College Equipment budget and is part of standard practice and policy.
The employeeâs department may choose to further equip the home or remote office with the following items, charged to that department. These items must be purchased by OIT and be from our preferred vendors. Departments are not permitted to purchase these or equivalent items outside of College and OIT purchasing channels.

Monitor
Laptop docking station
Keyboard
Mouse

Any items above and beyond the laptop will be shipped directly to the home or remote office from our resellers.
The College (neither OIT nor the employeeâs department) does not cover expenses nor subsidize the cost of internet access for the employee.
 
Remote Employee Obligations
The employee is required to:

Sign the Remote Employee Technology Agreement
Use the College Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution whenever doing College work, both at the home or remote office and while traveling, for security and access purposes
Retain all boxes used for packing and shipping peripherals and laptop
Ship all peripherals back to campus upon separation from the College
Return laptop to campus either in person or via shipment

'Berg Alumna Jacy Good Appears on the Oprah Winfrey Show



 Muhlenberg Alumna Jacy Good â08 will appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show on Friday, April 30, on a show that focuses on the dangers of text messaging and talking on a cell phone while driving.  


	 Monday, April 26, 2010  11:45 AM

Good spearheaded a bill in the Pennsylvania state legislature to ban the use of cell phones while driving, and was a force behind the recent law in Allentown.
Winfrey has declared April 30 “No Phone Day,” a large-scale effort to honor victims of distracted driving, "No Phone Zone Day" will also educate and activate Americans to end the deadly driving habits that kill nearly 6,000 Americans a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
"A call or text isn't worth taking a life," said Winfrey. "We must not allow more mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, sisters and brothers to die before we take action against distracted driving. Let's put a stop to it now, by joining together on April 30 for national 'No Phone Zone Day', and by making our cars a 'No Phone Zone.'"   "I've made it my mission at the DOT to end distracted driving. We know that if we can get people to put away cell phones and other electronic devices when they are behind the wheel, we can save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of injuries every year" said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood. "That's why I'm proud to support and participate in Oprah's 'No Phone Zone Day.'"
A working coalition of transportation safety organizations will come together as part of "No Phone Zone Day" activities and viewing rallies across the country, including U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and the Department of Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), the National Organizations for Youth Safety (NOYS), FocusDriven, SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions), RADD, the Entertainment Industry's Voice for Road Safety, and more.   In addition, "No Phone Zone" corporate partners Sprint, General Motors/Chevrolet and Liberty Mutual will lend their support, both for national "No Phone Zone Day" and in the coming months to spread the "No Phone Zone" message.  As a national call to action, all viewers and town hall participants will be asked to take the "No Phone Zone" pledge. By pledging, drivers agree to make their car a "No Phone Zone" and refrain from using their phone while driving, eliminating distractions from incoming calls, texts or emails.

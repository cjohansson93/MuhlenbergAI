Advising and Support
Health Professions AdvisingThe main goal of the Health Professions Advising office is to mentor students and alumni exploring a path towards a career in health and medicine. We offer advice on course options at Muhlenberg, taking the MCAT, and the application process. The office also hosts informational presentations throughout the year along with keeping students up to date on the latest events, scholarships and research opportunities. 
Faculty EngagementStudents get to know their faculty on personal levels as scholars and mentors. Many students work closely with faculty on independent research and are often listed as authors on publications and postersâa collaboration that proves invaluable when seeking evaluations and strong letters of recommendation for medical school applications.
The Pre-Health Faculty Advisory Committee is a small group of both science and non-science faculty who work with the Director of Health Professions Advising to counsel pre-health students on curricular and co-curricular choice during their years at Muhlenberg. The committee also works with the Alumni Advisory Board to provide direction for pre-health programs at Muhlenberg.
Alumni Mentoring and SupportAlumni contribute to the success of students by serving as mentors, advisors, career shadow hosts and internship supervisors. Muhlenberg's Pre-Health Alumni Advisory Committee consists of high-level health professionals work with our faculty advisory committee to provide insight into career trends. Additionally, the Muhlenberg Network connects alumni as mentors and resources for students and other graduates.

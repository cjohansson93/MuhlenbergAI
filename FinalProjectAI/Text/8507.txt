Purpose
The purpose of the Muhlenberg College Board of Associates (BOA) is to serve as community ambassadors for Muhlenberg College and to generate support for its strategic initiatives. We accomplish this by: engaging business, professional and civic leadership from the community with the Collegeâs administration, faculty and students; partnering with the College to implement programs that support student development; and fostering a sense of belonging to the greater community.
Membership
Membership of the Board of Associates is composed of recognized business, professional, volunteer and civic leaders in the community. Membership is by invitation only, by recommendation of the Membership Committee, and by the review and approval of the Executive Committee. Membership in good standing is maintained by the payment of annual dues of $60. Failure to pay dues for two consecutive years may result in the termination of membership. Currently, there are 215 active members across Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Minnesota.

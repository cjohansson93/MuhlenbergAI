ESC 182  Exploring the physical earth
This course is an introduction to the science of geology for non-science majors. Students will learn how the scientific method is used by geologists in their study of materials, structures, and physical features of the earth. Specific topics of interest include: the scientific method and the development of geology as a science; the formation and properties of minerals and rocks; plate tectonics and continental drift; the origins and consequences of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and flooding; factors affecting water movement and availability; origins and human use of important geologic resources like fossil fuels, diamonds, and other valued materials; how humans affect and are affected by earthâs physical environments, including how geology is used in land-use planning; and the history of the earth. One three-hour meeting each week: lecture, laboratory, field trips, and discussion combined. Students cannot earn credit for both ESC 182 and ESC 201.
Meets general academic requirement SC and satisfies the core geology requirement for ESC minors. 
ESC 381 Environmental science in popular culture
Science is often employed by writers of fictional works and can be essential in storytelling. This course will examine the use of science in film, television, and literature with particular attention to the ways science in general, and environmental science in particular, can be misrepresented, distorted, or fabricated. Students will assess the science presented in films including Supersize Me, Jaws, Jurassic Park, The Day After Tomorrow, Star Trek, and Planet of the Apes as well as supporting written works such as Close to Shore, Jurassic Park, and articles from the peer-reviewed scientific literature. The consequences of scientific inaccuracy on attitudes about individual organisms and ecosystems, resource utilization, the power and limitations of science, public policy, and funding priorities will be discussed. Students will be expected to screen films outside of the regular class time. Three hours of discussion each week. Prerequisite: Two courses in the sciences divisionMeets general academic requirement W.

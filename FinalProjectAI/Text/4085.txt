deangelis named to academic team



Junior Brittany DeAngelis of the Muhlenberg field hockey team was named to the Capital One Academic All-District II At-Large College Division first team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA). 
 
By being selected to the first team, she will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America consideration. 

A double major in business administration and psychology, DeAngelis started all 16 games at back for the Mules in 2010, earning All-Centennial Conference honorable mention after leading the team and ranking third in the CC with six defensive saves. Her biggest save came when she hustled to keep a ball from crossing into the cage with 12 minutes left at McDaniel, preserving a 2-1 win. DeAngelis ranks fifth on Muhlenbergs all-time list with 11 career defensive saves.

Off the field, DeAngelis is a member of Psi Chi, the international honor society for psychology, and is treasurer for Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society. She also is head of public relations and advertising for Student Athlete Mentors (SAM), a program in which student-athletes serve as a role models and mentors for their peers.

At Muhlenbergs Honors Convocation earlier this month, DeAngelis received two awards: the Paul M. White 27 Business Award, given to students who plan to specialize in the broad retail field, and the Harry A. Benfer Memorial Scholarship, awarded to a rising senior in good academic standing who promotes goodwill and who has an appreciation for all phases of college life, those being the characteristics most evident in the life of Harry A. Benfer.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on her team. The At-Large team includes the womens sports of bowling, crew, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, skiing, swimming, tennis and water polo.

This is the second straight year, and the third time in four years, that a Mule field hockey player has earned Academic All-District honors.

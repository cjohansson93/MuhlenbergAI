Women's Basketball Hands McDaniel First Loss
 Wednesday, January 7, 2015 - page 2







					 



While Hannah Rush had a career-high nine assists for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team in its Centennial Conference showdown against McDaniel, the biggest assist of the night went to freshman Rachel Plotke.

With 1:59 to go, an official noticed some blood on Rush’s shorts, which would normally force a player to sit until it’s cleaned up. Instead, Plotke thought quickly, dropped her shorts and handed them to Rush, who made the change at the bench to some catcalls from the Mule faithful. 

“It was very embarrassing, but it’s a part of the game. It was nice to know I had a teammate that so willingly gave me her shorts,” Rush said.



The shorts problem now solved, Rush (right) helped lead the Mules to a key win over previously undefeated McDaniel, 74-67.

“Them being undefeated, we knew they had been playing well together, but we had been playing well too, we just had some tough games down the stretch,” Rush said.

“We gave each other a lot of confidence from practice into the game, so it was really easy for me to go out there as a point guard knowing I have four other girls ready to play with me at the same level and intensity.”

The senior point guard from Havertown scored nine points and grabbed six rebounds to go with her nine dimes. Hers was not the only one that was impressive in this win that helped the Mules (5-5, 4-2) shake up the CC standings. Senior forward Leanna Tallamy posted a 14-point, 16-rebound double-double on 5-of-8 shooting from the floor, while Nicole Pepe led the ’Berg in scoring with 17 points on just eight shots. 

During a 20-day break between games over the holidays, head coach Ron Rohn installed a zone defense that limited the Green Terror’s open shots. When McDaniel did get into the lane, its shots were erased by Christina Santone, who tied her own school record with seven blocked shots and could have had three more on swats that were whistled for fouls.

“It’s really helpful to have a teammate like Tina. It’s easier to play and get out on the shooters knowing that I have her support behind me,” Rush said of Santone.

The Mules were kicking early, thanks to an 8-0 run in the first half, and took a four-point advantage into the locker room at half. The lead swelled to as much as 11, and they were able to keep off the long-bombing Terror thanks to the foul shooting of Laura Gregory (12 points, six rebounds, 4-of-5 from line). 

Following up a 31-point victory over Washington College back on December 20 by handing McDaniel (9-1, 4-1) its first loss of the year is exactly the type of start to 2015 the Mules are looking for. They can keep the trend of knocking off previously unbeaten teams on Saturday when they travel to 10-0 Gettysburg.

“We really needed this win. We were up and down in the beginning of the year, so it’s good to start off 2015 with this win. We have the confidence to go into the next game against another undefeated team with this excitement,” Rush said.

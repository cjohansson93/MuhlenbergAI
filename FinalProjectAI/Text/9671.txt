Resources for Research Students in Natural Sciences and Mathematics

Safety training and building access Safety training is handled by the department faculty in collaboration with the chemical hygiene officer .  Building access may be available for students that pass safety training; consult with faculty and the chemical hygiene officer. Trumbower: Dr. Joseph Keane and Mrs. Winnie Russell. New Science Building and Shankweiler: Ms. Diane Dologite
Instrument training Students may receive training to operate instruments. Which instruments are for public use is at the discretion of the faculty and the chemical hygiene officer.  Students may not operate an instrument without proper training.
Student researchers can find here a series of training videos for operating instrumentation and for conducting standard laboratory procedures.  These videos are not meant to replace personal training by a faculty member, but can serve as a reference for students when they are operating instruments independently.

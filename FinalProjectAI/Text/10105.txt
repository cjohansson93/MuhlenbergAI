Muhlenberg College welcomes students, faculty, staff and visitors with disabilities. As a College, we are committed to ensuring an accessible, welcoming working and learning environment for individuals with disabilities, including compliance with federal and state regulations.
Muhlenberg staff pursue accessibility best practices and compliance on the College website in the following ways:

Our content management system, TerminalFour, includes tools that pre-screen web content for accessibility compliance.
Our web design partner, FastSpot, utilizes best practices set forth in the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
Our site is monitored by an independent third-party firm for accessibility issues, which are reported and quickly addressed by the College's web team.

While we place accessibility among our highest priorities, we welcome suggestions and corrections from our website visitors and the College community. If you have a concern to share, please contact us at webmaster@muhlenberg.edu.

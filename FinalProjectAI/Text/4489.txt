wrestlers brawl at ursinus




The Muhlenberg wrestling team made the first of three scheduled trips to Ursinus this season, competing in the Ursinus Fall Brawl.
Of the seven Mules to take the mats, all but two won at least one bout, and three went 2-2.

Sophomore Matt Parker (right), who won only one bout all of last year, had his best day as a Mule, pinning back-to-back opponents 
in a combined 1:37 in the 141 consolation bracket. Sophomore Tommy Gazza (133) and senior Bill Sholly (197)
also split four bouts.

Junior Nick Pallotta had the misfortune of being paired with the third-ranked heavyweight in Division III. He was pinned but
came back to pin his next opponent. Senior Michael Slevin won a 14-13 decision in his first bout.

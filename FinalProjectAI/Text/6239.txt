Mayden Shatters School Record in 5K
 Saturday, April 14, 2012 - page 2







					 





In addition to his leg in the 4x100, Sullivan posted a pair of conference-qualifying times in the 100 and 200.






Freshman Cassiah Sahl took third in the first 5,000 of her competitive career. She missed the conference-qualifying time by just two seconds.




On a weekend when the Muhlenberg track and field team was spread out among three different meets that started Thursday afternoon and ended late Saturday night, 
it was the last meet that produced the biggest performances.

Junior Samantha Mayden broke the school record in the 5,000 meters at the Bucknell Distance Night. Her time of 17:13.55 beat the previous mark of
17:20.90 by more than seven seconds and hit the Division I ECAC qualifying standard. Entering the weekend’s meets, only four Division III runners had posted a better
time this season.

At the same meet, junior Erica Bash ran the 1,500 meters in 4:43.22 – a time topped this season in the Centennial Conference only by Mayden before the weekend. Bash entered the season with a personal best of 5:01.60 and lowered it to 4:50.50 at Lafayette two weeks ago before chopping another seven seconds off
this week. She ranks fourth on the Mules’ all-time performance list.

Junior Brendan Smith also took advantage of the competition to shatter a personal best at Bucknell. He ran the 5,000 meters in 15:08.92, almost 48
seconds better than his previous outdoor best of 15:56.16, to move into third place on the performance list. There was only one faster 5K in the CC before this week.

The Muhlenberg group that stayed closest to home posted some impressive performances at the Coach P Open hosted by Moravian.

On a warm day, the Mule sprint relay teams took full advantage of the ideal conditions.  

The men’s 4x100 team of seniors Peter Rice and Kyle Sullivan, junior Isaiah Vaughn and sophomore Darnell Davis finished third in the third-fastest time on the school’s performance list.

Davis and Rice also teamed up with sophomores Andrew Onimus and Jake Ullmann to take fourth in the 4x400. The team’s time of 3:22.70 not only ranks seventh on the performance list, but topped the best time in the Centennial Conference entering the weekend by more than six seconds.

Rice posted his best time of the season to take third in the 400 behind a pair of Division I runners.

The solid men’s showing continued in the distance events where four Mules qualified for the CC Championships by placing in 10,000. Freshman Luke Munyan and junior Nate Crossette, finished second and third in times that place them ninth and 10th on the all-time performance list, while freshmen Craig Welker and Zach Lifman placed fifth and sixth.

Sophomore Bobby McGetrick and freshman Kenneth Wohl finished fourth and fifth in the 5,000, and freshman Kieran Newcomb took sixth in the 1,500. Both McGetrick and Newcomb posted conference-qualifying times.

On the women’s side, the 4x100 team of sophomore Stephanie Carnevale and freshmen Kirsten Kuchera, Melanie Ferrara and Vanessa Chambers posted the fifth-best time on the performance list to take seventh, and sophomore Lauren Zakheim finished 15th out of 50 runners in the first competitive 800 of her life.

In the field, junior Ryan Hellings improved on his personal best in the pole vault with a height of 13-1½ to move up a spot to sixth on the performance list.

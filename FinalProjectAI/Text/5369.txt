a year later, women’s basketball gets even

Men Suffer First CC Loss



Undefeated Franklin & Marshall shot 58.6 percent  in the first half to open up a 16-point lead and went on to hand the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team its first Centennial Conference loss of the season.

The Mules (3-2, 2-1) got no closer than nine points in the second half until they made a basket in the final 15 seconds.

Junior Peter Barnes had a huge game, scoring a career-high 24 points to go along with 13 rebounds and three blocked shots. Freshman Spencer Liddic scored a career-high 19 points and pulled down eight boards.

Lancaster, 80-65. Although they went on to win the Centennial Conference title on the same floor, they didn’t get an opportunity to settle the score with the Diplomats, who were beaten in the semifinals.

“We definitely talked about it before the game,” said senior Lauren Boyle, who scored a team-high 21 points. “We had a little revenge because of what they did to us here last year – they beat us pretty bad. This does mean a lot to the team, especially those who played last year.”

It also means a lot in the CC standings. Muhlenberg (6-0, 4-0), which doesn’t have another conference game until Jan. 7, is the only team left in the CC without a loss in league play. Among the Mules’ four wins are road victories against the 2008 CC runner-up and the top seed for the 2008 CC playoffs.

This win followed a familiar pattern: Muhlenberg fell behind early (25-14 with four minutes left in the half), stayed within striking distance (down a point at halftime) and took control of the game with a second-half run (17-0).

“To be honest, I’m clueless, but I’m happy about it,” said Boyle when asked to explain the Mules’ second-half surges. “The one thing we always say is ‘keep running them, they’ll get tired,’ so maybe that’s it.”

Muhlenberg trailed 34-30 five-and-a-half minutes into the second half when the run started with a turnaround baseline jumper by sophomore Sheila Cook. A second-chance jumper by freshman Alexandra Chili tied the score, and a pair of Boyle free throws with 12:49 on the clock put the Mules ahead for good.

A pair of fast-break baskets by sophomore Kelly McKeon, a three-pointer by Chili and field goals by Cook and Boyle finished the run, which put Muhlenberg up 47-34 with nine minutes left.

F&M (3-2, 2-1) closed to within five, but the Mules made enough free throws down the stretch to maintain a comfortable lead.

McKeon finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds for her third double-double. Chili added 10 points and five assists, and senior Erin McSherry spearheaded a defensive effort that held the Dips to 31-percent shooting with 11 rebounds and five blocks.

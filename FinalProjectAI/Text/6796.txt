Tennis Teams Drop Finales


Both Muhlenberg tennis teams lost their season finales to teams headed to the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The women entered their home match against Dickinson needing a win to earn their fifth CC playoff berth in eight seasons.
The Red Devils won, however, 6-3. The Mules finished in a three-way tie for fifth place in the CC with Washington and Franklin & Marshall.
Washington won the tiebreaker based on total matches won in head-to-head competition among the three.

Senior Amanda von Taube, playing in the final match of her career, teamed up with sophomore Sharen Resnikoff
 for an 8-1 win at No. 2 doubles. Resnikoff went on to capture her No. 4 singles match.

Junior Gabriela Contino played an outstanding match at No. 6 singles, rallying to win after dropping the first set in
a tiebreaker. She won the second set, 6-4, and prevailed 10-7 in the supertiebreaker.

The men won the doubles in their match, but Ursinus, the fifth seed for the upcoming CC playoffs, captured four of six singles matches for
a 5-4 victory.

Sophomore Eric Chavis was the lone Mule to win both of his matches, scoring close victories at No. 2 doubles (8-6) and
No. 5 singles (three sets).

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team finished the 2013 season doing something it did routinely during the season: making a late rally to tie a game in the closing seconds of regulation.




Carpetto picked up a career-high seven ground balls in his last game, finishing in seventh place on the Mules' all-time list with 143 for his career.



Unfortunately, the Mules’ last comeback did not lead to victory, as Ursinus scored with 34 seconds left in the first overtime to come away with an 11-10 win. 

Muhlenberg finished its season at 6-9 overall and 2-6 in the Centennial Conference. Four of the games went into overtime, and in all of them the Mules scored the tying goal in the last 20 seconds of regulation.

For the second time, it was senior Doug Rheiner who scored the dramatic goal, netting his third goal of the game with 14 seconds left to complete Muhlenberg’s comeback from a three-goal deficit entering the fourth quarter.

Muhlenberg won the opening faceoff in overtime and took three shots but could not score. The Bears (9-5, 3-5) ended the game with a goal on their first possession of the extra period. 

Since Ursinus and Muhlenberg both joined the CC in 2003, they have played each other in the final game of the regular season seven times, and five of the games have been decided by one goal, with three going into overtime.

Rheiner’s three goals gave him a school-record eight hat tricks for the season. His 31 goals were the second-most in a season in program history, and his 41 points were just one shy of the school record.

Rheiner wasn’t the only senior instrumental in the fourth-quarter comeback. Michael Carpetto and Jack Reilly scored goals, defenseman Ian de Ruiter notched his first point of the season with an assist, and Ian Jones won three faceoffs.

Junior Casey Gill scored a pair of man-up goals for his first career multiple-goal game, and sophomore Jason Mertz had a goal and two assists. Junior Zack Gunzburg made a career-high 16 saves in his first start of the season.

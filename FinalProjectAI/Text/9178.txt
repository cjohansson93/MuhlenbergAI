Last fall, staffers from the Office of Communications sat in on a number of first-year seminars to observe how Muhlenberg introduces its new students to college-level writing. Professors from a variety of disciplines design and teach the courses. Some select a topic thatâs closely related to their academic specialty, while others choose something theyâre personally passionate about. While the seminars vary widely in subject matter and structure, they all share the same end goal: to teach students to think critically and analytically when constructing an argument.
âThe difference between high-school and college writing is less a matter of style than of attitude," says English professor Jill Stephen, who co-directs the Writing Program with fellow English professor David Rosenwasser. âRather than framing a single argumentative claim and repeatedly demonstrating that it is âright,â students in first-year seminars learn to treat ideas as hypotheses to be tested.â
The seminars are smallâlimited to 15 students eachâand each one has a paid writing assistant, a returning student who has completed a credit writing theory course, attends all the classes and works with first-year students inside and outside the classroom to develop their writing skills. Thirty-three seminars are offered in the fall, with another eight offered in the spring. Hereâs a glimpse at one of the seminars that took place last semester.
If the first-year seminar Queer Media were graded solely on participation, all these students would get As. Each time Beth Corzo-Duchardt, the visiting assistant professor of media & communication who created the class, asks a question, hands shoot into the air and students bounce in their seats, eager to share their viewpoints. 
This writing-intensive course examines queer representation in mainstream media. Today, the class is discussing Austin Powers. In the courseâs textbook, âIn a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Livesâ by J. Jack Halberstam, the author argues that the International Man of Mystery âis kind of like a drag king, in that heâs performing an outdated masculinity that functions to call attention to the way dominant masculinity is constructed,â Corzo-Duchardt says. 
Students have strong opinions about the film: About the movieâs Fembots, one student says, âReally? Machine guns coming out of their chests?â Another, referring to the main female character, says, âCan a female heroine just be not sexualized and be plain looking and fully clothed?â The students weigh in on Austin himself, too: âHeâs sort of this parody of a sexist man, but he also makes such a fool of himself that heâs the joke that weâre laughing at,â one says.
The course, like all first-year seminars, requires students to make careful observationsâin this case, about works like âCarol,â âHedwig and the Angry Inchâ and âOrange Is the New Blackââthey can use to support verbal and written arguments. Corzo-Duchardt, a film and TV scholar, says the course is âa great way to introduce students to more academic ways of thinking about queerness, and to introduce them to contemporary queer theory as an introduction to college theory.â

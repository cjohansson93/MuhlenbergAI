LOCAL FAITH COMMUNITIES
Religious Life is an important part of the Muhlenberg College community. Campus ministries at Muhlenberg offer an array of opportunities for religious services, text studies, social events, andservice in the Lehigh Valley and beyond. Many students find that on-campus offerings satisfy their religious and spiritual needs. Others find that supplementing their on-campus experiences with offcampus religious communities suits them best.
Religious Resource Guide
This Religious Resource Guide has been created to provide information about the communities that relate to the wide selection of religious traditions in the Lehigh Valley. If you would like information about a congregation, please call them or consult their website as listed. This is not a complete list of religions, or congregations, in the area; only the ones nearest to campus are listed. If you are looking for a particular congregation or faith tradition and do not see it listed here, please contact a chaplain for assistance.

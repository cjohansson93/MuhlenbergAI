Junior John DeLuca of the Muhlenberg football team was named co-offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

DeLuca rushed for 161 yards on 23 carries (a 7.0 average) and tied a school record with four touchdowns in the Mules’ 44-3 win at Juniata. His scoring runs covered
10, 20, 22 and 38 yards in the second and third quarters, turning a 3-3 tie into a 30-3 Muhlenberg lead. DeLuca matched a school record set six times previously, most
recently by Matt Bernardo against Ursinus in 2002.

Despite playing less than three quarters, DeLuca amassed 190 all-purpose yards.

For the season, DeLuca is second in the CC in rushing, averaging 117.0 yards per game. He also is tied for fourth with six touchdowns. DeLuca’s production has
helped the Mules move up to second in the CC in scoring offense, at 27.0 points per game, and third in total offense (360.6 yards per game).

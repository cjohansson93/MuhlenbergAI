Devils Beat Mules Twice




More often than not, 14 runs is usually more than enough to win a normal baseball game. Unfortunately for the Muhlenberg baseball team, its game with Dickinson was anything but normal.

In a game that featured 11 extra-base hits, 12 pitchers and six innings with at least three runs scored, the Mules could not keep up with the Red Devil offense, falling 19-14.

Muhlenberg (18-17, 2-11) trailed by just two after five, but Dickinson (20-11, 7-6) scored 12 combined runs in the sixth and seventh, which was more than enough to hold off a late Mule charge.

Sophomore Nick Kennedy (left) hit his team-high-tying fifth home run, a three-run line-drive shot to left in the eighth, to finish the day 4-for-5 with five RBI.

Senior Brian Beck finished with three hits, three runs scored and two RBI, and classmate Nick Busillo collected two hits and broke the school record with three sacrifice flies on the day. Freshman Chris Manfredonia singled in the sixth to extend his school-record hitting streak to 19 games.

The men’s tennis team played its closest match of the spring, falling at Dickinson, 5-4.

The Mules won two of the three doubles matches, including a 9-8 (8-6) nailbiter at No. 1 by senior Jordan Rutt and sophomore Jason
Teitelbaum, but the Red Devils went 4-2 in doubles to win the match.

Freshman Daniel Lakhman won at both doubles and singles.

She may just be two tournaments into her collegiate career, but freshman Christina Bryde is already making a name for herself on the Muhlenberg women’s golf team.

After placing in the top 10 in her debut tournament last month, Bryde (right) took her game up a notch, tying for medalist honors to lead the Mules to a fourth-place finish, third amongst Division III teams, at the Ursinus Invitational.

Bryde shot an 84, the best score by a Mule since 2007 and a five stroke improvement from her first round of the season, to tie for the lead. She finished second after the matching of scorecards tiebreaker.

She was one of three Mules who bettered their scores from the opening tournament. 

Senior Amanda Heiberger shaved four shots off her previous career best, finishing with a 103, and freshman Katie Seeman posted an impressive 28-shot improvement from her first career tournament.

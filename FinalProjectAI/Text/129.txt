Rachel FarrowAssistant Director of Communications for Social Mediarachelfarrow@muhlenberg.edu.The assistant director of communications is responsible for strategic planning and tactical implementation to advance the Collegeâs social media presence across multiple platforms. Reporting to the Senior Director of Communications, this very dynamic and visible position is integral to the communications team.
Prior to joining the Office of Communications at Muhlenberg, Farrow worked in a variety of media and public outreach settings. She most recently served as an outreach and education specialist for a domestic violence and sexual assault organization and is very passionate about victim's rights and social justice. In that role, Farrow was chosen to host a keynote speech with Miss America 2020 on National Overdose Awareness Day as well as give a TEDx Talk in 2019.
Farrow holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa as well as an associate's degree from Luzerne County Community College with a focus in journalism. She is a native of the Lehigh Valley (go Parkland Trojans!) and is passionate about storytelling, Philadelphia sports and bright colors.
When she's not busy looking for a story to share, she can be found at home with her husband, son and her pets (2 dogs and a cat.)

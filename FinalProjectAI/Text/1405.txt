Muhlenberg Summer Music Theatre update
Dear Patrons:
As you probably know, the Covid-19 pandemic has prevented production of Muhlenberg Summer Music Theatre shows for the past two years. We now find ourselves in a position in which â due to a number of circumstances, including the ongoing pandemic â we are uncertain of the future of summer programming at Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance. We certainly plan to resume offering excellent opportunities for growth and performance for our students during the summertime, and soon. What exactly those opportunities will be is yet to be determined.
We also look forward to inviting our loyal Summer Music Theatre patrons back to campus for exciting performing arts events. Will they be the MSMT productions you've come to know and love over the past forty years? Time will tell.
We appreciate your patronage and support, and we look forward to seeing you all at Departmental productions and in whatever summer endeavors the future may bring. We'll be in touch.
Sincerely, Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance Staff

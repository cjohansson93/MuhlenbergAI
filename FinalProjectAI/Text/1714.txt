Class Visits
Special Collections & Archives welcomes the opportunity to partner with faculty members to use our materials to enhance the undergraduate learning experience. Engagement with primary source material inspires original scholarship, enhances critical thinking skills, and provides a unique opportunity to deepen studentsâ knowledge and appreciation of a subject. Whether for a one-time classroom session or a semester-long collaboration, we would be happy to discuss areas in which our collections can intersect with your course material. 
Recent Examples
In recent semesters, we have partnered with faculty in History, Religion, Media & Communication, Art, Anthropology, and others to engage students with primary source material. 

HST 221: Colonial America
HST 285: History of the American West

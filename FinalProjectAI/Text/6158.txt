Men's Basketball Season Has "Super" Opening
 Tuesday, November 15, 2011

 Football honors


Before he had played his first game Malique Killing earned the nickname “Superman,” from his teammates on the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team.

And in his collegiate debut, Killing showed why he’s earned that moniker as he scored the final eight points, including a driving 

layup between a pair of defenders with 2.1 seconds remaining, to give the Mules a dramatic 74-73 come-from-behind victory over Moravian.

“Pandemonium,” Killing said of his final shot. “Being my first varsity game, I really wanted to get a win. When I saw it was me 




Dean hit his first two shots and finished 7-for-12 from the field.



and the big man, I knew I was going to the rim and would either make the shot or make the ref blow his whistle.”

Struggling with turnovers and cold perimeter shooting, Muhlenberg trailed for most of the game. And with second half winding down, Moravian appeared to be starting to pull away when it took its largest lead of the game, 72-65, with 2:49 remaining.

That’s when Killing took over.

After the two teams traded foul shots, Killing hit a driving layup and drew a foul for a three-point play to cut the deficit to 73-69 with 1:40 left.

On the Greyhounds’ next possession, he got a steal and was fouled on a breakaway. He made one shot to make it a one-score game.

After a pair of missed Greyhound free throws, freshman AJ Dean grabbed the rebound under the Moravian net and 

was able to just barely keep his toes in bounds. The Mules worked the ball to Killing, who hit another layup in traffic to cut the deficit to one 




Junior Hunter Forsman made his first career start and finished with three points and five rebounds.



with 55.1 seconds to play.

Moravian missed a contested layup on its next possession, and senior Spencer Liddic corralled the rebound with 22.3 seconds remaining to set up Killing’s heroics.

After being sidelined for some of the first half because of foul trouble, Killing turned his game up in the second half, scoring 13 of his team-high 17 points after the break. 

“Coach just told us to keep playing our game and stay confident,” Killing said. “I felt like I let my teammates down by getting into foul trouble in the first half, but they did a great job of picking me up. I really wanted to try to make it up to them down the stretch. We really picked it up down the stretch, and the combination of defense and hustle got us the win.”

He was not the only freshman to impress in his debut. Dean finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds to become the first freshman to record a double-double in his first game since 2003-04. Patrick Hanafin chipped in eight points, and Gabriel Mercer scored three and dished out two assists.

Liddic recorded his 29th career double-double with 14 points and 15 rebounds, while sophomore Austin Curry added 13 points.

The win gives Muhlenberg a 7-3 lead in the Matte Award standings heading into the spring season. And according to Killing, it was the perfect way to start his collegiate career.

“It was crazy,” Killing said of his first college game. “I was a little too anxious at the beginning of the game, which is why I got into foul trouble. But once I calmed down, it became just like another basketball game for me. That was amazing, and I hope it’s just the first of many big wins.”

Soccer Teams Can't Break Through

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team looked set to overcome a stark disparity in shots in a tough road contest against Scranton. A late equalizer undid the Mules, however, and allowed the Royals to come away with a 2-1 overtime victory.

The Mules (3-4-1) took an early lead when senior C.J. Graetzer scored in the 12th minute on a spectacular shot from 43 yards out. The goal, Graetzer’s second of the season and the 14th of her career, gave freshman midfielder Courtney Simon (left) her first career point and assist, and was the Mules’ first tally in three games. 

Despite a 23-5 disadvantage in shots, the Mules held on until the waning moments, when the Royals knotted the contest with less than two minutes remaining in regulation. Scranton then ended things with a penalty kick goal seven minutes into the extra session, denying Muhlenberg’s bid for only the second victory over the Royals in program history. The Mules fell to 1-13-3 all-time against Scranton.

Peppered throughout the contest, senior goalie Amanda Wong stood tall, finishing with eight saves.

For the second straight game, a huge advantage in shots failed to yield a positive result for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team.

Despite controlling play throughout and outshooting host DeSales, 22-5, the Mules (4-4) were unable to find the back of the net and suffered a 1-0 setback. It was Muhlenberg’s third consecutive loss, and came just three days after the Mules were on the right side of a 23-6 disparity in shots and still dropped a 2-1 overtime decision against Gettysburg in their Centennial Conference opener.

After a scoreless first half, the Bulldogs broke through in the 60th minute.
 
Desperately searching for an equalizer, the Mules had several scoring chances as the game wound down, but each went begging. The most promising opportunity came with just under six minutes to play, when senior back Bucky Aronoff (right) one-timed a right-footed rocket off a header in the box, but his blast was palmed into the air and just over the crossbar by the DeSales keeper, denying Aronoff his first career goal. The Bulldogs managed to hold on from there to win their fifth straight.

Freshman forward Phil Rahling and sophomore back Farrouk Bello each made their first career starts for the Mules.

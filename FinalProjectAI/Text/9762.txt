Juliette Reilly â16, a music major with creative writing and English minors, is on a mission with her music. Around age 9, when she saw her aunt perform on Broadwayâin shows like Cats and Phantom of the Operaâshe knew she wanted to be a singer. With time, her goal shifted from Broadway to writing, and during her sophomore year in college, she composed her first anti-bullying song. Today she writes and sings what she calls âIndie Pop-timismâ to help fans cope with the mental health challenges of being a teen. The singerâs fan base now includes 200,000 people across social media platforms.
Muhlenberg Magazine What inspired you to write and sing songs about teen bullying?
Juliette Reilly â16 I was bullied in high school. The first song I wrote that did well on YouTube was basically a letter to my younger self and my little sister, who was in middle school, called âHero.â It was produced by fellow alumni Mike Emmerich â15 and David Goodheart â13. I had fans send in videos of themselves holding up signs and singing along for the video, and thatâs when I learned how big an impact writing songs could have on a young audience.
MM Whatâs been the most meaningful message youâve received from a fan?
JR Iâve had people direct-message me or send letters saying that my songs have saved their lives, or send photos of them getting tattoos of my lyrics. A lot of my fans struggle with mental health, and for my music to make that much of a difference in someoneâs life means the world to me. Itâs why I do what I do.
MM Tell us about your work with Project Semicolon.
JR In addition to my own battles with mental health, Iâve had many friends and family who struggle with it and who have had even more traumatic experiences. Hearing their stories and now those of my fans, I realized that many more people deal with it than we think and that itâs critical to raise awareness.
Project Semicolon is a teen suicide prevention nonprofit organization dedicated to solidarity against depression, addiction and other mental health issues. I have written original music for them and performed with them and was featured in their book. They have been a great resource for me to share with my audience as well.
MM What are you proudest of so far in your career?
JR The fact that Iâve stayed true to my message: to inspire and empower teens, in particular teenage girls, to be their own heroes. This has led me to incredible places like Nashville, Tennessee, where I moved after college to further connect and grow as a songwriter. Itâs very easy to get caught up in what the next trend is, and itâs good to be aware, but itâs infinitely more important to stay true to whatâs most important to you.
MM Whatâs next for you?
JR Iâm releasing a new project this year called Emotional Influencer, which consists of two EPs highlighting the contrast of who we are on the inside versus what we portray on social media. I also recently started a project for TV/film music thatâs landed some 2021 ads and major network placements, including MTVâs Teen Mom, CBSâs General Hospital and the new Hulu series Kung Fu. Iâm writing original music for a national anti-bullying play called Speak Life thatâs currently in more than 300 schools.

Walsh brings more than 25 years of combined legal and human resources experience to her new role at Muhlenberg. Her previous work includes practicing as an employment law attorney, clerking for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and serving as VP of HR at SAIC, a Fortune 500 firm.
âOver the years, being able to coach, teach and train on a variety of HR and legal matters has always been one of the best parts of my job. It is my privilege to be joining a team that shares this passion and lives it every day in a setting that encourages collaboration, diversity and inclusion," says Walsh. "I felt welcome from the moment I stepped foot on campus, and the energy of the Muhlenberg community was unmistakable. I look forward to working with my Muhlenberg colleagues in support of the Collegeâs mission."
"Jill rose to the top of a highly competitive and diverse pool of candidates," says Kent Dyer, Muhlenberg's chief business officer and treasurer. "Her legal and HR experience uniquely qualify her for the role. The breadth and depth of her experience impressed not only the search committee, but all those who interviewed her on campus."
Walsh earned a bachelor's degree in international language/business at the University of Scranton and a J.D. from the University of Baltimore School of Law. She also holds a number of human resources certifications, including the Society for Human Resource Managementâs Senior Certified Professional, Senior Professional in Human Resources and Certified Compensation Professional.

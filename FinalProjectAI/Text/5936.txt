Men's Soccer Falls to Dickinson in Centennial Semi
 Friday, November 4, 2011







					 


For the third time in four years, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was knocked out of the Centennial Conference playoffs by Dickinson.

The Red Devils scored once in each 

half en route to a 2-0 in the second semifinal at Johns Hopkins. They advance to face fifth-seeded Haverford, who upset the top-seeded Blue Jays, 2-1, in Sunday’s championship match.

It was Muhlenberg’s first CC playoff loss by more than one goal in its 11 appearances.

Dickinson (10-4-4) controlled the tempo from the start and struck first on a free kick in the 12th minute. 

A little more than 15 minutes later, the Mules (10-6-1) had two of their best chances when senior Josh Luginbuhl got the ball behind the Red Devil 


defense and found himself one-on-one in the box. But the Dickinson keeper made a leaping punch save, sending the shot over the crossbar.

On the ensuing corner kick, junior Danny Way (right) made a run at the far post, but his header sailed just wide to the right.

Muhlenberg got a fortunate break in the 35th minute when the Red Devil keeper was whistled for a yellow card after grabbing the ball outside of the box. 

Junior Nate Squire sent a free kick towards the net, and sophomore Jonathan Schauer (left) got his head on it. But the ball sailed high, and the score remained 1-0 at the break.

Dickinson, ranked seventh in the region by the NCAA, stormed out of halftime, firing off nine shots in the first 15 minutes, and added a second tally in the 63rd minute to make it 2-0.

Muhlenberg almost cut the deficit to one less than 10 minutes later, but Luginbuhl was unlucky once again when his point-blank shot was saved.

Sophomore Jas Chojnowski finished with seven saves, include three on hard shots from close range in the second half, to keep the Mules in the game. 

Dickinson held a 28-10 advantage in shots and had an opportunity to extend the lead to three on a shot at an open net in the 78th minute, but freshman Bryan Attanasio got his foot on the ball and cleared it away.

Muhlenberg finished the season with double-digit wins for the fifth straight year, which is tied for the second-longest streak in school history.

Field hockey stuns No. 6 hopkins 


It always feels good to beat a nationally ranked team, but this win had a little more to it.

Ever since losing to Johns Hopkins in a contentious Centennial Conference semifinal playoff game last year, the Muhlenberg field hockey team has been looking forward to taking the field against the Blue Jays again.

The wait proved

worth it, as the Mules gained a measure of revenge by defeating Johns Hopkins, 1-0, on junior Tara Cohn’s goal 32 seconds into overtime.

Hopkins (13-2, 6-1) came in ranked sixth in Division III, with its only previous loss coming to No. 2 New Jersey. The Blue Jays were seventh in Division III in scoring and had not been shut out in a CC regular-season game since 2005.

The win was Muhlenberg’s first against a nationally ranked team since last year’s regular-season finale vs. No. 19 Gettysburg and its first against a top-10 team since a 3-2 defeat of No. 9 Montclair State in 2003.

The first half was fairly evenly played until the last eight minutes, when the Blue Jays ran off a string of eight penalty corners. Senior Michelle Consiglio made three of her seven saves in that stretch.

The second half was a different story, with Hopkins on the attack most of the time. The Blue Jays were awarded 14 corners in the last 35 minutes, but the Mule defense did an outstanding job defending them. Hopkins took 25 corners in the game but managed only nine shots.

“We knew how great their offense is and we kept saying, ‘Everything you have, everything you have,’” said senior Kristin Garbutt, who made a defensive save early in the second half. “We just sucked it up and worked hard.”

It was appropriate that a defensive player set up the winning goal. Senior Cara Rothacker, who joins classmates Julie deLaurentis and Garbutt on the back line, sent a free hit from near the sideline into the circle, and Cohn did the rest, lofting a shot over the left shoulder of the Blue Jay goalie, who was moving to her right.

Cohn’s 11th goal of the season ended the fastest overtime win on record in Muhlenberg history.

The Mules (6-8, 3-4), winners of two in a row, are scheduled to face two more nationally ranked teams (No. 4 Ursinus and No. 15 Gettysburg) this season.

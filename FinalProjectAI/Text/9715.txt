The video, organized by Director of Multicultural Life Robin Riley-Casey, consisted of recorded remarks from students, faculty and staff that both celebrated the memory and contributions of Martin Luther King Jr. and discussed the work that is still needed to address systemic racism and gross inequality in America.
Speakers included Riley-Casey, President Kathleen Harring, Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and English Emanuela Kucik, Assistant Professor of Dance Randall Smith, Associate Provost for Faculty and Diversity Initiatives Brooke Vick and students Krystal Hall â21, Mercy Olajobi â21, Ayanna Roberts â21, Jaunice Vega â22, Kelsey Casimir â23, Giovanni Merrifield â23 and Zaire Carter â22.
âIt is important together to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., because his legacy reminds us that in the midst of struggle there is hope for a brighter day,â says Riley-Casey on the importance of the 2021 commemoration.
âOn this day, we honor the contributions of Dr. King and recommit ourselves to the ongoing work of expanding equality and justice in our country and across the world. We especially feel the gravity of this day, in a year that has illuminated gross inequalities across public health during a pandemic, a racial reckoning, borne of systematic difference in the value of Black and white lives and an assault on our nation's capital by a mob intent on subverting democracy,â said President Harring during her remarks. âBut at the same time, on this day, we can feel the tide turning. We sense a new awakening. Certainly, we have much to do to put the world right.â

The Muhlenberg College Office of Multicultural Life and Africana Studies Program will continue their spring semester programming with Black History Month observances and events. Details on those activities will be shared with the Muhlenberg community in the coming weeks.

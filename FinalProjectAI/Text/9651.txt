This fall, staffers from the Office of Communications sat in on a number of first-year seminars to observe how Muhlenberg introduces its new students to college-level writing. Professors from a variety of disciplines design and teach the courses. Some select a topic thatâs closely related to their academic specialty, while others choose something theyâre personally passionate about. While the seminars vary widely in subject matter and structure, they all share the same end goal: to teach students to think critically and analytically when constructing an argument.
âThe difference between high-school and college writing is less a matter of style than of attitude," says English professor Jill Stephen, who co-directs the Writing Program with fellow English professor David Rosenwasser. âRather than framing a single argumentative claim and repeatedly demonstrating that it is âright,â students in first-year seminars learn to treat ideas as hypotheses to be tested.â
The seminars are smallâlimited to 15 students eachâand each one has a paid writing assistant, a returning student who has completed a credit writing theory course, attends all the classes and works with first-year students inside and outside the classroom to develop their writing skills. Thirty-three seminars are offered in the fall, with another eight offered in the spring. Hereâs a glimpse at one of the seminars taking place this semester.
Melissa Dowd, a biology lecturer, performs a Google search, and an illustration of a young girl with a puffy, lopsided face appears on the screen in the front of the classroom. Thereâs a mumps outbreak at Syracuse University, and many of the students in this first-year seminar, The Next Pandemic, donât really know what mumps isâevidence of the efficacy of childhood vaccinations in the United States. âA lot of times, anti-vaxxers donât view diseases as life-threatening because we havenât seen them because weâve been vaccinating,â Dowd tells them. A student asks whether Syracuse is forcibly vaccinating, which segues nicely into that dayâs writing exercise on a chapter of âPandemicâ by Sonia Shah that addresses responsibility and blame during outbreaks.
Itâs the first time Dowd has taught a first-year seminar. âWriting is not my forte, so itâs been a learning process for me too,â she says. âSome of the things I see lacking in sophomores are the things Iâve tried to focus on,â like including super-long quotes because theyâre afraid of plagiarizing and/or theyâre looking to take up space. âI donât give them a page count,â Dowd says. âI donât want them to fill a paper with fluff that doesnât mean anything when the paper would be so much more impactful at five pages instead of 10.â

Recently graduated Muhlenberg field hockey standout Lauren Rutt was named to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division at-large second team, as selected by the College
Sports Information Directors of America. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the at-large team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.2 cumulative grade-point 
average and a starter or significant reserve on her team in the sport of bowling, crew, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, skiing, swimming,
tennis or water polo. 

Rutt graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in Spanish on Sunday. A Muhlenberg Scholar, she completed the elementary education program and received
the Eastern College Athletic Conference Merit Award.

On the field, Rutt was a second-team All-South Region and first-team All-Centennial Conference selection in 2007, helping the Mules earn the third seed in the Centennial
Conference playoffs. She scored a career-high five goals, finishing her career with 33 points on 10 goals and 13 assists. Rutt was named Muhlenberg’s 
Outstanding Athlete by the Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women.

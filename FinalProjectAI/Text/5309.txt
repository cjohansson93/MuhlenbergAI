mules open doors to allentown girls



National Girls and Women in Sports Day is a day for women to celebrate their participation in sports. 
The Muhlenberg community did its part to encourage female participation in athletics by hosting more than two dozen inner-city girls from the Allentown community last week. 

These young girls come to Memorial Hall and Deitrich Field House and rotated among eight different stations, learning skills in tennis, basketball, soccer, volleyball, 
track, field hockey, lacrosse and softball from Muhlenberg women athletes. The event gave the girls the opportunity to play different sports 
to which they otherwise might not have been exposed.

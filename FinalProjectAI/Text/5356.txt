deluca, rathbun named to all-america team



Seniors John DeLuca and Matt Rathbun of the Muhlenberg football team were named to the D3football.com All-America third team, announced before Saturday’s 
Stagg Bowl.

DeLuca (right) was voted the Centennial Conference offensive player of the year after rushing for a school-record 1,634 yards and 15 touchdowns. 

He ended the season ninth in Division III in rushing yards per game and 15th in all-purpose yards per game. 
DeLuca ran for at least 100 yards in 10 of the Mules’ 11 games, with two 200-yard efforts. 
He finished his career as Muhlenberg’s second leading rusher with 4,041 rushing yards, good for sixth on the CC all-time list.

DeLuca also earned All-America honorable mention as a member of the Muhlenberg lacrosse team in the spring. That makes him the first athlete in College history to be named
an All-American in two different sports. (Will Elson was an All-American in both indoor and outdoor track in 2003.) In addition to his athletic accomplishments, DeLuca
was an Academic All-American in football this past season.

Rathbun (left) was the CC defensive player of the year and the leader of a unit that ranked 14th in Division III in total defense. The outside linebacker led the Mules with 84 total tackles and led the 
CC with 16½ tackles for loss. He had three sacks and intercepted four passes, setting a school record with 164 yards on interception returns. 
He returned one of his picks 29 yards for a touchdown against Ursinus. A team captain as a senior, Rathbun finished his career with 212 total tackles, 
including 37 for loss, and 14 takeaways on a school-record eight fumble recoveries and six interceptions.

Muhlenberg has placed at least one member on the D3football.com All-America team seven of the last 10 years, but this is the first time since 2000 the Mules have had two
players selected. Including other organizations’ selections, 13 Muhlenberg football players have earned All-America honors since 1999.

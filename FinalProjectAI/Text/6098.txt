"M.V.-Pete" Is "M.V.-Re-Pete" at Conference Track Meet
 Saturday, February 25, 2012 - page 2







					 


One of the new fads on television is shows about prospectors heading to Alaska in search of gold and fortune.




Yalango's gold with the 4x800 relay was the first of her Mule career.




But when it comes to finding the shiny stuff, it’s tough to top Muhlenberg’s Peter Rice.

The senior sprinter earned gold medals in all four of his events at the Centennial Conference Indoor Track & Field Championships to earn his third 
straight Most Outstanding Track Performer award (two indoor, one outdoor). He is the second Mule to win the award three times, and his 16 career 
gold medals are the most in program history.

His performance helped the Mule men finish fourth in the team race, while the women finished seventh, led by the gold-medal winning 4x800-meter relay team.




This is the second time Rice has won four golds at a CC Championship. He is the only Mule to ever accomplish that feat.



Rice’s golden day started when he teamed with junior Isaiah Vaughn, senior Kyle Sullivan and sophomore Jeff Reinhart to break the 
school and conference championship meet records in the 4x200-meter relay in a time of 1:31.07.

He followed that up with another conference meet mark to win the 400 meters by almost a full second (49.43).

“You always want to run your best at the championships; this is what we work for all season,” said Rice, who has won four golds at the past 
two championship meets. “It helps when you have great teammates. We had such a huge lead in the 4x2 that all I had to do was stay in front. My 
job was easy.”

Rice missed another meet mark by .01 seconds in winning the 200 and closed out his perfect day by teaming with classmate Michael Baer and 
sophomores Andrew Onimus and Jake Ullmann to win the 4x400meter relay gold. It’s Muhlenberg’s third straight 4x400 indoor crown.

Two weeks after breaking the conference record, the women’s 4x800 team of seniors Kimberlee Yalango and Nicolette Miller, junior Erica Bash and sophomore Nicole Cronin captured just the second relay gold in women’s school history.

On the individual side, Vaughn added an individual school record to his relay mark, taking second in the 60-meter dash in a time of 7.11 seconds. 
He finished just ahead of senior Kyle Sullivan, who grabbed bronze. Vaughn and Sullivan also finished third and fourth, respectively, in the 200.

Senior Marc Brookland finished third in the triple jump for his 10th career medal and came in fourth in the long jump. 
Junior Ryan Hellings grabbed the bronze in the pole vault.

Joining them on the medal stand was junior Samantha Mayden who grabbed silver in the mile for her first career CC track medal. She also came in 
fourth in the 3,000.

Sophomores Stephanie Carnevale and Amber Lee Wojtkowski finished third and fourth, respectively, in the 55-meter hurdles. 
Carnevale is just the second Mule female to ever medal in the indoor hurdles.

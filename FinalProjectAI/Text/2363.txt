âBerg Participates in Performances of âThe Cloth Peddlerâ 



Open Rehearsal to be held in Allentown; Main Performance to be held in Los Angeles


	 Monday, August 26, 2013  08:59 AM

In preparation for their September 7 performance of “The Cloth Peddler” in Los Angeles, Muhlenberg faculty, alumni and students are holding an open rehearsal of the piece on Monday, August 26, at 7:30 p.m. in the Baker Theatre.  "Arshin Mal Alan," or "The Cloth Peddler," composed by Uzeir Hajibeyov,  is perhaps the most well-known and beloved operetta among Azerbaijanis today. Written in 1913, it displays tuneful arias, joyous dances and delightful comic characters, a sort of Middle Eastern take on Gilbert and Sullivan.
Michael Schnack, the College’s director of choral activities and voice area coordinator, provides the stage and music direction.  Music faculty members Brian Chu, Lauren Curnow Madigan '96 and Steven Snow have singing roles, and Vincent Trovato is the rehearsal pianist.  Jeffrey Peterson,  assistant professor or dance, choreographs.  Alumni participating include: Megan Prima ’07 (production design); Nelle Ed ’10 (stage manager); Emily Ancona ’13, Ellen DiStefano ’12, Christine Marty ’12, Kristen Santos ’13, Caitlin Sauter ’13, Meredith Stapleton ’13, Jaclyn Walsh ’12 and Nick Picknally ’13 (dance ensemble).  Current student, Samantha Simon ’15, is an understudy.
Free tickets for the open rehearsal may be ordered at www.eventbrite.com
The Los Angeles production will be presented in the main hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (135 N. Grand Ave Los Angeles, CA 90012) in Los Angeles on Saturday, September 7 at 7:30 p.m.  Other non-Muhlenberg affiliated performers include opera singers brought in from Vienna, San Diego, LaCrosse, Philadelphia and Iowa City.  The production will be accompanied by musicians of the LA Opera Orchestra as well as a professional tar soloist from Azerbaijan.
This production is organized by the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan (LA General Consul Nasimi Aghayev) and financed by a corporate sponsor, Practical Solutions Group, from Baku.

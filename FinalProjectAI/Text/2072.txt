Name: Marten J. Edwards
Department: Biology
General Statement of Expertise: My research program uses molecular tools to investigate the biology of mosquito reproduction. I am studying the regulation of gene expression in mosquito ovaries by testing the function of eggshell gene promoters in transgenic mosquitoes. These promoters are being linked to antiviral genes, in order to block the transmission of LaCrosse Virus from female mosquitoes to eggs. My lab is also using molecular methods to estimate genetic diversity among Pennsylvania’s Brood X 17 year periodical cicadas, Magicicada septendecim.
Description of role in this project: We will develop the method of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) to estimate genetic diversity within and among populations of Lindera benzoin. We will determine whether populations of spicebush that are used in this study are genetically homogeneous. This will enable us to determine whether differences in plant volatiles that are observed between plant populations have a detectable genetic component.

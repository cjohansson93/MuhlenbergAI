Emergency Medical Services
General Operations
MCEMS (Muhlenberg College Emergency Medical Services) serves over 2,200 students, visitors, faculty and staff at Muhlenberg College located in Allentown, PA. It is a student-run organization, which serves as a volunteer Quick Response Service and answers approximately 300 calls for medical assistance annually. MCEMS also provides stand-by services for major campus events such as Homecoming, Family Weekend, Music concerts and Commencement. MCEMS also sponsors CPR and AED classes that are open to the Muhlenberg community. MCEMS works closely with Student Health Services,, Campus Safety, Allentown EMS and Cetronia EMS.
MCEMS is dispatched by the Department of Campus Safety via a tone and voice paging system. Our vehicle (QRS-1) responds to all calls, in addition to a Campus Safety Police Officer. Currently, our response times average 2-3 minutes. QRS-1 is a fully stocked First Response Unit which carries the same equipment as a Basic Life Support Ambulance, with the exception of a stretcher.
After an initial assessment and stabilization, the crew consults with an on-call Nurse from the Health Center.. Our patients are typically transported to the Health Center , Lehigh Valley Hospitals (Cedar Crest & 17th Street Sites), Sacred Heart Hospital , or St. Luke's Hospital. If the patient requires Advanced Life Support or ambulance transportation the Campus Safety dispatcher activates Allentown EMS via the 911 System established in Allentown.

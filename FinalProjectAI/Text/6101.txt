Track and Field Teams Shoot Down Three Records
 Friday, February 10, 2012







					 





Mayden's double win was made more impressive by the fact that the mile and 1000 were only an hour apart.




An armory is a place where ammunition and weapons, commonly called “arms,” are stored. For the Muhlenberg track and field teams, however, the weapons they use at the Armory in New York are their legs.

The Mule runners combined for three school records and a bunch of outstanding performances at the Lafayette-Rider games, held at the same venue that will host the Millrose Games tomorrow.




Onimus is now part of school-record 4x400 relay teams both indoors and outdoors.


Junior Samantha Mayden had a phenomenal meet, winning both the 1,000 meters and the 
mile. Her time in the 1,000 (2:58.69) broke the former school record of 3:07.16 – held by a three-time NCAA qualifier –  by almost nine seconds. In the mile, Mayden clocked in at 5:01.73. That time is two seconds off the school record, but when converted to a flat-track time, it ranks as the 11th-fastest mile in Division III this year.

Seniors Nicolette Miller and Kimberlee Yalango helped set a school record in the 4x800 relay, and they may have set 
another record – longest wait to knock oneself out of the record book. As freshmen in 2009, Miller and Yalango ran two legs of the relay that 
established the school record of 9:42.40 at the Centennial Conference Championships. Three years later, they (along with junior Erica Bash 
and sophomore Nicki Cronin) set a new standard of 9:33.37.

The men’s 4x400 team of sophomores Andrew Onimus and Jake Ullmann and seniors Kyle Sullivan and Peter Rice broke the eight-year-old school record of 3:25.64, winning their race in 3:23.73.

Rice, who is a part of five school-record relay teams, also won the 400 meters, with Ullmann coming in seventh and improving on the personal best he set last week. 

Junior Isaiah Vaughn finished third in the 60 meters at 7.22, just four hundredths of a second off the school record of 7.18. He also ran the second-fastest 200 in program history, 22.73, four hundredths of a second away from the top time in the CC this year.

Bash climbed to third on the Muhlenberg performance list and second on the CC list in the 800 (2:19.27).

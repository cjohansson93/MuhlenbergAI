Field Hockey Bests No. 20 Dickinson on OT Stroke

Although it may have seemed like freshman Gwen Remaley stood alone to take the potential game-winning penalty stroke in overtime, she had the whole Muhlenberg field hockey team with her.

Remaley (left) calmly converted the stroke 2:22 into the first overtime to give the Mules a 3-2 win against 20th-ranked Dickinson – their second victory against a nationally ranked opponent this year.

“I wasn’t expecting to take it,” Remaley admitted. “I started running back to the 25 until one of my teammates told me I was taking it. I tried not to freak out too much. It was nerve racking, but the whole team is a family and was back there for support.”

Remaley’s first career goal – which is believed to be Muhlenberg’s first overtime penalty stroke goal ever – ended a game that featured plenty of scoring early in periods but nothing after that.

The Mules (7-2, 3-1) jumped on top just 68 seconds into the game when senior Samantha Swire scored on a rebound off a penalty corner. It was Muhlenberg’s earliest goal since it scored one 40 seconds after the opening whistle in a 1999 game against Montclair State.



That was all the scoring in the first half, but the Mules added an early score again in the second half, when senior Kayleigh Thies found Lauren Jordan in front of the cage to make it 2-0.
 
Dickinson entered the game having allowed only two goals total in its last five games and ranked seventh in Division III in goals-against average.

The Red Devils, who came in with a nine-game winning streak, took only six shots in the game (compared to 19 for the Mules), but two of them went in just 37 seconds apart to tie the game with 27:04 still left in regulation.

“At first when they tied it up it was very frantic,” said Remaley. “But we had a timeout and we said that the only way we were going to win was to play together. After that, we worked better and pushed forward.”

Dickinson had only one penalty corner and one shot the rest of the game, but Muhlenberg could not score before time expired in regulation. The Mules went into overtime for the first time this year, and again a talk they had in the huddle proved to be fruitful.

“We said that if we get this up early and score we can be done,” said Remaley. “We didn’t want to play a lot of overtime.”

They didn’t. Muhlenberg controlled play from the outset, and when the Dickinson goalie fell on the ball after saving a shot by sophomore Emily Boyle, the stroke was awarded.

The Mules are 7-2 after nine games for the first time since 2003, and six of their wins have come against teams they lost to last year.

“It’s definitely a confidence booster,” said Remaley of the team’s start. “It makes our practices better, and the whole mindset of going in there with confidence gets us motivated for every time we play.”

Teaching Interests
I enjoy providing students with challenging research assignments that have practical application and don't have specific right answers. Students in my International Law course and International Environmental course solve hypothetical cases ranging from the secession of a lunar colony from Earth to liability for oil spill damages and challenges to intellectual property rights. My students in American foreign policy and comparative national security policies courses produce policy memos and formal policy analyses in the style of the U.S. Department of State.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy principal research interests fall in the area of Chinese foreign policy and American foreign policy. In particular, I apply constructivist and realist analytic frameworks in explaining foreign policy. My current areas of focus are the South China Sea dispute and exploring the shift in Chinese foreign policy rhetoric from more Marxist to more traditional Confucian rhetoric.

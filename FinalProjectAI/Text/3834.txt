Women’s Lacrosse Loses Close Game at Haverford


The Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team completed its challenging start to the Centennial Conference schedule with an 11-9 loss at Haverford.

The Mules first three CC games were against the three

teams in the league that have received votes in the national Division III poll this season. The three teams have a combined record of 21-5, with all five losses coming to nationally ranked opponents.

Muhlenberg (4-4, 0-3) came closest against the Fords, who received votes in the poll for two weeks earlier in the season. The Mules led 4-3 midway through the first half before Haverford (6-3, 2-1) ran off three straight goals to take a 6-4 lead. 

Although the Mules had a 27-20 advantage in shots and got within one goal on four separate occasions, the last with less than three minutes left, they never caught up.

Junior Angela Napoletano scored four goals for her sixth hat trick of the season. Freshman Kaitlyn McCaffrey led the defense with six ground balls.

It's not often that senior Danielle Winston of the Muhlenberg women's tennis team gets to see her teammates in action during a match.

Winston plays a deliberate style with long points, and her match is usually the last one on the court.

But for the second time in as many days she got to

watch a good portion of the Mules' matches after not dropping a game at No. 4 singles to help Muhlenberg to a 9-0 win over Bryn Mawr (2-9, 0-4).

Winston also did not drop a game yesterday against Moravian. It's the first time a Mule player has won back-to-back singles matches 6-0, 6-0 since Pam Kimmelman did it against McDaniel and Bryn Mawr in 2007.

Winston's shutout was the 80th win (combined singles and doubles) of her career, and earlier in the match she helped partner Lindsay
Schmidt record her 50th career doubles win. The duo won 8-1.

Freshman Gabriela Contino joined Winston in the love club after not dropping a game at No. 6 singles.

After not winning one singles match 6-0, 6-0 last season, Muhlenberg (5-2, 3-1) has already done it five times this spring.

No. 2 singles was fairly close, but in the other eight matches, the Mules lost only nine games.

All three of Muhlenberg's CC wins this season have come via 9-0 sweeps. The Mules currently sit in third place in the conference with a match against one of the teams tied for first, Washington, scheduled for Saturday.

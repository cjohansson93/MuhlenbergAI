ferrigno earns cc softball honors



Muhlenberg junior catcher RiRi Ferrigno was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team for softball.

Ferrigno hit .311 for the Mules in 2008 and led the team in home runs (2) and RBI (21). Both of her home runs came in the final weekend of the season, a grand slam in an 8-5 win against CC champion Ursinus and a three-run blast against Washington. Behind the plate, she committed only two errors in 176 chances.

In CC games, Ferrigno ranked ninth in the league with a .367 batting average, eighth with a .531 slugging percentage and tied for third with 13 RBI.

The third Muhlenberg catcher to earn first-team All-CC honors, Ferrigno will enter her senior season with 97 career hits.

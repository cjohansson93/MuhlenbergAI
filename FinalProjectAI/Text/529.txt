Career Road Trips
Each semester, the Career Center plans day-long Career Road Trips to various cities that allow students to tour organizations, gain insight into a number of industries and network with alumni. Road Trip stops for the 2018-2019 academic year include Live Nation, Bloomberg, Planned Parenthood, Shakespeare Theatre Company, the Brookings Institution and WHYY, among many others.
Below, some participating alumni share why they offer their time to visiting Mules.
Dan Asip â08, director of premium account service and suite sales & service at Madison Square Garden (MSG)âWeâre always looking for the type of quality students that I know Muhlenberg produces. What better way to showcase MSG than to give them a peek behind what makes our company a world leader in live sports and entertainment?â
 
Allison Giordano â12, people team specialist at VevoâI've been fortunate enough to have worked with or even hired many Muhlenberg alumni, and time and again, I see so many commonalities from each alum. These commonalities have been overwhelmingly positive and have proven the benefit of hiring not only liberal arts students but, more specifically, Muhlenberg students into the business world. It can be tough for Muhlenberg students to see that about themselves when they first begin their job search and I think it's important to illustrate these possibilities through stories of many different career paths from fellow alumni.â
 
Phylicia Lee â10, associate program manager at TransPerfectâThere are so many opportunities available for bright students coming from a liberal arts backgroundâwhether thatâs translation, technology, sales...the list goes on. TransPerfect is more than just a translation company, and I know Muhlenberg grads can bring this organization to new heights.â
 
Danielle Ruffini â14, clinical practice supervisor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer CenterâAs a media & communication major at Muhlenberg, I never thought my career path would cross into healthcare. Healthcare administration bridges the gap between science, business and communication and allows me to work closely with dedicated clinical and leadership teams to help produce exceptional patient care and innovative research in a field that touches so many lives. I hope to bring Muhlenberg students closer to what it means to work in healthcare administration and how various areas of study can be found in our field.â
 
Lisa Siciliano â10, manager, digital video operations at Viacom Digital PartnershipsâI hope to inform, inspire or give hope to at least one student attending the Career Road Trip. Working at Viacom for the past six years has been an amazing experience with countless opportunities, and I'd love to share what I've learned.â
 
Jen Taylor â05, senior director of digital marketing at A&E NetworksâGraduating from college and entering the workforce can feel daunting. I think itâs important for students to have access to peopleâespecially alumniâwho work in different industries in order to get a feel for a particular role and advice on how to get there.â

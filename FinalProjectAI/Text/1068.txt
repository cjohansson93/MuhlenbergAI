Campus Community Message from President Harring
Tuesday, March 17, 2020

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
I have a lot of important information to share about the impact of COVID-19 on our campus and our region. As always, the health and safety of our community is our top priority and we are committed to sharing the latest information with you regarding the impact of the coronavirus.
Earlier today, a community member notified the College that they were tested for COVID-19. This individual does not live on campus and is following the recommendations of their health care provider to self-quarantine in their residence until the test results are known. The Allentown Health Bureau informed the College that at this time, there is no need for any additional measures for the College or any individuals to take. We are currently following regulations with respect to confidentiality and cannot reveal the identity of the individual. Should the test come back as positive for COVID-19, we will work with the Allentown Health Bureau to notify any individuals who may have come in contact with this person. Moving forward, we will only share health alerts for individuals who are confirmed presumptive positive for COVID-19.
Now that testing is more readily available, we expect that we will hear about more individuals from our campus community being tested. This is good news for treatment and containment of the virus. I want to remind you of the latest CDC guidance. If you develop symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) OR have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, please make sure to stay in your home. If you are a student, contact Health Services (healthservices@muhlenberg.edu, 484-664-3199) and if you are a staff or faculty member, contact Human Resources (hr@muhlenberg.edu, 484-664-3166). It is important for the College to understand the health status of our students, faculty and staff, as that will have an impact on future decisions.
Yesterday, following Pennsylvania Governor Wolfâs declaration of a state of emergency, Lehigh County officials also declared a state of emergency for the county. As of this morning, there were 76 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 14 Pennsylvania counties, with most of those cases in the southeastern part of the state. The Governor has urged all non-essential businesses to close for at least 14 days to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus. This follows the closure of all public schools in the state for a two-week period. We saw similar actions taken in New Jersey on Monday, where the CDC reports 98 confirmed cases of the virus.
As of tomorrow, the College will have moved all of our learning and operations to remote platforms and minimized the number of people on campus to those needed to provide essential services to the students remaining in campus housing and those needed to maintain business continuity for the College. The expectation is that any faculty or staff who are able to work remotely will do so. All campus buildings will be closed to the public, though card access will be available to faculty and staff as well as those students approved to remain on campus.
In the wake of these actions, Dean Gulati urged remaining students to consider if they need to stay on campus. Many of the remaining students do not have a choice; the College is prepared to fully support those students who need to remain here, however, the on-campus services will be minimal. At this point in time, the primary advice for everyone is to practice social distancing, wash your hands often and to not touch your face as the means to help limit any potential exposure. We are also beginning to hear advice to limit your time outside of your primary residence.
Now that our immediate action planning is underway, there are a number of important questions to be answered. The administration is committed to sharing a decision about the status of the semester beyond April 13 by the end of March. In the meantime, we have asked all events beyond that date that expect more than 50 participants to begin the process to reschedule those events for the fall term. And yes, that means we are considering options concerning commencement activities as well.
Many families whose students have returned home have asked about refunds for room and board charges. While I know many of you would like a resolution to this question quickly, the College will only be able to calculate the amount that will be credited to a student's account at the end of the semester. At that time, we will prioritize processing billing and financial aid adjustments.
We are aware of a petition from students to offer courses for the semester as pass/fail and understand student concerns. We will be discussing this with the relevant faculty committees and are researching the consequences of any decision on financial aid eligibility, graduate school applications, or other situations. We want to make sure that if we move to some type of pass/fail option students understand the consequences that this may have on their individual post-graduate outcomes. We will share additional information once we have discussed these issues and others with the faculty.
This is a lot of information, I know. But I want to share just a few more thoughts. Over the course of my time at Muhlenberg I have witnessed the College move through other crises. Many of those events impacted us and members of our community personally; though few have caused the kinds of unprecedented disruption to our daily lives that we are now witnessing. Whenever I talk with someone about the College, one of the first things I tell them about is our unique community. How supportive and collaborative we all are, right down to holding open our red doors.
The past eight days have shown me just how strong our community is. Over this time, we have collectively accomplished a major feat in planning and moving all of our learning and operations to remote platforms.
Our own experience on our campus has been tempered and contextualized by that of the country, and the world, as a whole. I will share that yesterday morning we finalized a plan to begin a formal remote working plan for our staff, and only hours later Lehigh County declared a state of emergency. I can tell you that knowing we had made a decision to safeguard our community was reassuring.
Before us is an incredible opportunity to translate an exceptional educational experienceâthe Muhlenberg experienceâfrom one that is in-person and community-based, to one that is virtual and still community-based. I believe we not only have the capacity to succeed, but the will to make it happen. I continue to be proud of how the Muhlenberg community is working together to cope with this challenge and I encourage you to take care of yourself and those you care about.
Sincerely,
Kathy HarringInterim President

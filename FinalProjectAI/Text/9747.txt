As her final year of teaching approaches, the College is honoring Roberta Meek, who has woven education, activism and advocacy throughout her career, by celebrating students who share a commitment to those values with the Professor Roberta Meek Africana Studies Award.
Meek, a lecturer of media & communication and Africana studies, began teaching at Muhlenberg in 2009. She directed the Africana Studies Program from 2014 to 2019.
During her tenure, Meek has earned a reputation for pushing students to think outside the classroom when it comes to understanding African American history and how it intersects with social movements, race and media.
âThe award is a direct reflection of the ways that Professor Meekâs classes and the work she does with her community remind us of the full humanity of Black people in a world that tries to dehumanize them,â says Emanuela Kucik, assistant professor of English and Africana studies and co-director of the Africana Studies Program.
The awardâwhich was originally announced as a potential scholarship last Februaryâhas been endowed by an anonymous Muhlenberg alum. (Individuals wishing to honor Meek can make a gift toward the endowment here.) It will be presented annually to a student who embodies the Africana Studies Programâs core tenet of intertwining scholarship and activism, following the example of Meek, Kucik says.
Robin Riley-Casey, director of the Office of Multicultural Life, was spurred to establish the award after hearing students praise Meek for her âintellectually challenging and socially upliftingâ classes, which inspired them to become more active and engaged citizens.
The recipient of the inaugural award, Giovanni Merrifield â23, was chosen by the Office of Multicultural Life and the directors of the Africana Studies Program and was announced at the 2021 Honors Convocation.

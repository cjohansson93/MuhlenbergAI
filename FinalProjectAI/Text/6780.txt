Bauer All-East; Carnevale Breaks Hurdles Record

Three Muhlenberg athletes tried to improve their chances of qualifying for the NCAA Division III Track & Field Championships by competing at last chance meets.

Yesterday, sophomore Tyler Bauer earned All-East honors by placing eighth in the javelin at the IC4A Championships. In a field of 25 throwers at Princeton,
Bauer was one of only two from Division III. The other, from Rutgers-Camden, owns the best javelin mark in Division III this season and finished second. 

Bauer
beat 17 Division I athletes by throwing 204 feet on his first attempt. Although that didn’t improve his standing on the performance list, Bauer is in 
good shape with the 10th-best mark in Division III this season and less than a week to go until championship berths are announced.

Today, junior Stephanie Carnevale broke her own school record by running 14.70 in the 100-meter hurdles at the Swarthmore Last Chance Meet. She
was headed for a much faster time before knocking over the ninth hurdle. Carnevale improved slightly on her previous
record time of 14.76, which was 26th in Division III entering the meet.

She and classmate Amber Lee Wojtkowski (left), who finished in 16.00, will run again at the ECAC Championships
at Springfield on Thursday.

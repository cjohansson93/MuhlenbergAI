Men's Golf Wins Makuvek Cup, Matte Point
 Monday, October 6, 2014







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s golf team picked up its second first-place trophy of the fall, outshooting local rivals
Moravian and DeSales to win the John Makuvek Cup, an annual tournament named for the longtime Moravian coach.

The Mules, who opened the season by winning a tournament hosted by Moravian, were six strokes better than the Greyhounds to earn a point in
the Matte Award competition. Muhlenberg leads the all-sports race, 3-0 (also winning in men’s soccer and volleyball); the next
Matte contest is scheduled for October 28 in women’s soccer.



Sophomore John Froberg shot a career-low 72, two strokes off the lead. Five over par after the first five holes,
Froberg rebounded to go minus-3 the rest of the way, recording five birdies on the final 11 holes.

Sophomore David Barkley (80), freshman Evan Overcash (81) and juniors Greg Hewitt (82) and
Jonathan Graulich (83) rounded out the top five. Hewitt (left) shot a birdie on the 498-yard, par-5 11th hole.

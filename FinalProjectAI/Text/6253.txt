Women's Tennis Picks Up Key CC Win Over Washington

On Friday the 13th, the number 14 turned out to be the lucky one for the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team.

The Mules dropped just 14 games in their five wins as they picked up an important Centennial Conference victory over Washington, 5-4. The win moved Muhlenberg into a tie with Gettysburg for the fifth place in the CC with one week left in conference play.





Contino has won three straight matches at No. 5 singles.




“It was a really good win, especially because it was unexpected,” said freshman Sharen Resnikoff. “The older players told us that Washington was a good team, so it feels good to win this match.”

Washington, which is ranked eighth in the region, has lost four of its five matches since losing two of its top four players because of injury. But that didn’t mean the Mules could just show up and win. They still had to take care of business on the court, which they did, especially at No. 1 singles. 

That’s where sophomores Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman rallied from a 4-1 deficit to pick up the tightest win of the day, 8-6.

That comeback, coupled with an 8-0 shutout at No. 3 doubles by Resnikoff and junior Amanda von Taube gave the Mules a 2-1 edge heading to singles play.

There, the Mules (4-5, 4-3) swept all three matches at Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in straight sets to snap their four-match losing streak against the Shorewomen (9-5, 5-4).

Sophomore Gabriela Contino and von Taube did not drop a game in either of their first sets en route to a wins at Nos. 5 and 6, respectively. Resnikoff, meanwhile, posted her team-high sixth CC win, 6-2, 6-1, at No. 4.

Resnikoff said she had a feeling coming into the match that her singles point would be an important one. And she could not have been any more correct as the Mules picked up their second one-point win of the conference season.

“We felt good coming out of doubles with two points and thought our matches would be deciding ones,” Resnikoff said of Nos. 4, 5 and 6. “So it was really good to win all of them; that turned out to be the difference in the match.”

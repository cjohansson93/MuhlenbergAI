take a bow:field hockey returns home



We woke up this morning for breakfast around 9 a.m. and had about a 3.5 out of 5 meal. After our last beach/pool hangout we all got packed up and headed down to our vans for the last time. Our drivers Kenrick and Carl were very adamant in telling us that we were their best group ever and that they really enjoyed driving us. 

We said our goodbyes to Domonic and Melissa and headed to the airport. The airport was a bit of a hassle getting our tickets but once we were at the gates we were good to go. The flight was fine, no real issues besides a few crying children and smelly passengers. We landed at JFK at around 7:30 and had to wait for our bags for about an hour. From there we all went our separate ways excited to be home but happy we shared those 10 days of paradise together. 

Overall it was an amazing trip with a lot more ups than downs and more fun than we could have imagined. We wanted to thank 
everyone involved including our wonderful van drivers, our great tour guides, our coaches and everyone who was following our journey online. Thanks again!

Also, I talked to Domonic the other night and he told me that he loves Rihanna and 
that some Bajans are just bitter. So, I figured it would be okay to re-include Rihanna in the blog (we never did see her). Courtney DeAngelis worked her magic and came up with a Rihanna-lyric themed journal entry (all lyrics are marked with quotations).  Hopefully everyone can appreciate a little more of the Bajan 




lifestyle, as well as our field hockey team, now that you have read all about or trip.  Enjoy!

Bajan Persuasions: Please Dont Stop the Music
	[Our stay in beautiful Barbados has been an incredible journey.  In our last few hours here we reflect on this trip and all of our excursions.  Naturally, we spent the majority of our time at the beach, and consequently learned that, There will always be a first time you get burned.  That time came sooner for some more than others, as day 3 marked the start of tomato-red faces and peeling skin. But in their defense, the weather here could be quite deceiving, as the clouds rolled in and yet the sun shined through the rain.
  
The Bajans were so friendly and welcoming throughout our trip, and we quickly discerned a few differences between the American and Bajan lifestyles.  We observed their lax approach, Forget about your troubles, its alright, let them go til we see the morning light.  We also realized their lacking sense of urgency, which can be simply described by, If youre willing to wait we just take our time.  We adapted rather easily to this lifestyle  even when one Bajan team didnt show up to our scheduled 6:30 game until 6:45.  Admittedly, we werent so patient just following a game when it came time for dinner, as the meals took 2+ hours to arrive; all was, of course, right in the world once the food was delivered and devoured.  

When it came to field hockey, their pace was contrarily much faster.  The Bajans could 



easily transition from 0 to 60 in 3.5, as they would effortlessly sprint from one end of the field to the other in spite of the blaring heat and humidity.  Accordingly, we heard coach from the sidelines yelling, Run, run, run, run, everybody, move, run.  This game strategy explains why none of us could walk by day 4, but Berg hockey knows No pain is forever.  We battled with our competition and affirmed the motto, Go hard or go home.
 
Our vacation wasnt devoted entirely to field hockey, and we had plenty of down time to relax.  One particular night was spent visiting the Plantation Theater for the show, Rhythms and Roots.  The production exemplified their laid-back attitude and friendly nature.  The limbo contest pulled participants on stage who represented all different places from around the world, and showed that it, Doesnt matter who you are or where youre from, just come and dance to the music of the sun.  

We also experienced an island safari tour and a catamaran cruise.  I know its not an ordinary, everyday thing, to venture on either of these excursions and I can assure you that both were equally incredible.  More specifically, on the safari tour, we had breathtaking views of the ocean, and felt the Bajan beauty, it a gimme di chill.
  
Unfortunately, as we depart today, Now all I have are these photographs, but I know that the memories will last forever!]

Now that Rihanna and Court have helped sum up our journey I wanted to know what the team thought of the trip. So, I asked each individual to give me a word or phrase that they thought would sum up this trip. Here it goes:




A big thank you and thumbs up to Kasza for her colorful reports from the island.

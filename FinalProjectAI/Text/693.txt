Alexandra Frazer, Ph.D.

Assistant Professor Cognitive Psychology, Psychology of Language Moyer Hall - Room 224 afrazer@muhlenberg.edu484-664-4313 Fax: 484-664-5627
BackgroundB.A., M.A., Northern Arizona University; Ph.D., Lehigh University
Professor Frazer started teaching at Muhlenberg in 2013 and teaches Introduction to Psychology, Psychological Statistics, Research Methods, Sensation and Perception, Cognitive Processes, a seminar on the Psychology of Language, and also teaches the training course for new Learning Assistants â Adult Personal and Cognitive Development. She previously taught classes at Lehigh University and at Lafayette College.
Research InterestsMy work is in cognitive psychology. My research interests include psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics, the representation of conceptual knowledge, language production and comprehension, memory, attention, and language and the media.
I am currently pursuing language research along three major lines. First, I am interested in how recent selection and use of certain grammatical structures influences later use of those same structures and syntactic alternatives (e.g. active/passive alternation). I am also interested in how the availability of to-be-spoken words influences structural selection. In addition to my work on syntactic representation, I am researching word form production by considering which components of words are the functional units of phonological encoding using the form preparation task. Essentially in this task, participants are given a group of words that share the initial sounds (e.g. bake beach, bore, boot) and asked to iteratively name them. The degree of relatedness in sounds is varied, and we compare how easily participants can access those words compared to ones that do not share a relationship. Last but not least, I am also studying the combined and separate effects of phonological form preparation, a facilitatory attentional process (described above), and semantic interference, which involves unconscious adaptation in memory, using blocked cyclic picture naming.
My previous work has been on sentence structure when non-professional writers describe interpersonal and sexual violence; specifically I have found that peopleâs selection of active or passive voice in descriptions of spousal violence is often influenced by the gender of the victim relative to the gender of the perpetrator. I am interested in expanding this line of work to better understand how the linguistic presentation of information may alter the assignment of blame and responsibility on a more general level. I have recently worked on a project with Muhlenberg students, examining how victim-blaming in police shootings may be expressed linguistically.

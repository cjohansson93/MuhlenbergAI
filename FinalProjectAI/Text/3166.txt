Seniors John DeLuca, William Moates and Matt Rathbun of the Muhlenberg football team were named to the D3football.com All-South Region Team.
All three were first-team selections in balloting by South Region sports information directors and D3football.com staff.

Through games of Dec. 6, he ranked ninth in Division III in rushing yards per game and 15th in all-purpose yards per game. 
DeLuca ran for at least 100 yards in 10 of the Mules’ 11 games, with two 200-yard efforts. 
He finished his career as Muhlenberg’s second leading rusher with 4,041 rushing yards, good for sixth on the CC all-time list.

Moates (top center) was a standout at nose tackle in the Mules’ 3-4 alignment. A unanimous first-team All-CC selection, he was fifth on the team with
46 total tackles and third with eight tackles for loss, including three sacks. Moates also broke up six passes and blocked a field goal try, helping Muhlenberg rank in the
top 15 in Division III in total defense.

Rathbun (top right) was the CC defensive player of the year. The outside linebacker led the Mules with 84 total tackles and led the 
CC with 16½ tackles for loss. He had three sacks and intercepted four passes, setting a school record with 164 yards on interception returns. 
He returned one of his picks 29 yards for a touchdown against Ursinus. A team captain as a senior, Rathbun finished his career with 212 total tackles, 
including 37 for loss, and 14 takeaways on a school-record eight fumble recoveries and six interceptions.

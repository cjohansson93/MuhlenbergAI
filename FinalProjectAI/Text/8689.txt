Department Faculty & Staff
The Muhlenberg Art Department includes seven full-time faculty and a number of visiting artists and lecturers. Our range of skills and interests allows us to teach an extremely wide variety of courses at all levels, and our active professional practices ensure that we remain well connected with numerous contemporary art and art historical discourses. The departmentâs small class sizes provide many opportunities for us to work closely with students, designing independent studies, collaborative research and studio projects.

Men's Lacrosse Falls in Opener

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team could not hold on to a one-goal halftime lead and lost its first game of the 2013 season, 9-6 at Montclair State.

The loss spoiled a phenomenal effort in the X by senior Ian Jones, who lost his first faceoff before winning the last 17 of the game. The 17 faceoff
wins were a career high for Jones, four short of the school record, and he also tied his career high with 11 ground balls.

The Red Hawks, who have been to the NCAA Tournament each of the last four years, held a 10-3 advantage in shots late in the first quarter, but the Mules dominated the
second 15 minutes with a 14-1 shot advantage. Sophomore Jason Mertz scored his first career goal 23 seconds into the second quarter to tie the
game at 2-2, and with 12 seconds left in the half, junior Tom Glancy (left) scored off a rebound to give Muhlenberg its first lead at 4-3.

Montclair scored the first two goals of the second half to jump back in front, but senior Jack Reilly netted a pair of game-tying goals, one late in the
third quarter and the second early in the fourth to tie the score at 6-6. The Red Hawks kept the Mules off the scoreboard for the remaining 10:54, however, scoring
three goals themselves to pull away for the win.

Senior Doug Rheiner had a goal and an assist for Muhlenberg. Sophomore Adam Schlauch tied a career high with 11 saves and picked up
six ground balls.

aferiat named player of the week



Junior Corey Aferiat of the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Aferiat scored three goals, including the go-ahead tally and an important insurance goal, in the Mules’ 11-10 win against 11th-ranked Gettysburg on Saturday. 
Aferiat, who came into the game with only two goals all season, scored with 6:34 left in the fourth quarter to put Muhlenberg up 10-9, just nine seconds after
the tying goal, then added another score at the 4:10 mark. He scored his three goals on only four shots as the Mules posted their first win ever against the 
Bullets.

Aferiat’s second career hat trick helped Muhlenberg become the first team to score in double digits against Gettysburg this season. The Bullets held
their first eight opponents under 10 goals for the first time in their history and still lead the CC in team goals-against average (6.72). Gettysburg also
had its 16-game CC regular-season winning streak snapped.

Aferiat has scored seven points on five goals and two assists this season. For his career, he is tied for second among active Mules with 47 career points.

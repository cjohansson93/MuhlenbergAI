2022-23 Department Season
   It is with great excitement that we announce the 2022-23 production season for Theatre & Dance!
   We have worked hard to put together a season that reflects values of our department: work that puts into practice what we explore in our classrooms, studios, and shops; work that foregrounds issues of social justice; work that fosters collaboration between students and faculty and creates community; and work that provides opportunities to tell stories from a diversity of perspectives and experiences.
   Below you will find a season that delves into past traditions and reimagines them, a musical that feels cutting edge and relevant almost 100 years after its premiere, contemporary plays that ask hard questions about the relationship between art and society, and newly created works of dance and theatre that speak to our moment.
   We hope you are as excited as we are!

We Are Proud to Presentâ¦
a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as South West Africa, From the German SÃ¼dwestafrika, Between the Years 1834 - 1915
Sept. 29 â Oct. 2, 2022
by Jackie Sibblies Drury directed by Nigel Semaj
A group of actors gather to tell the little-known story of the first genocide of the 20th century. We Are Proud to Presentâ¦ takes place largely in a rehearsal room that descends from collaborative to absurd as a group of idealistic actors â three black and three white â attempt to recreate the extinction of the Herero tribe at the hands of their German colonizers.

The Threepenny Opera
Oct. 28 â Nov. 6, 2022
by Bertolt Brechtin collaboration with Elisabeth Hauptmannmusic by Kurt Weill directed by James Peckmusical director: Vincent Trovato
Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, The Threepenny Opera follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (aka Mack the Knife) as he tries to woo Polly Peachum and elude the authorities. With its palpable evocation of corruption and dread, set to Weill's irresistible score, The Threepenny Opera remains a landmark of early twentieth-century musical theatre.

Local Girls
April 20-23, 2023
by Emma Goldeldirected by Beth Schachter
Local Girls is a play with music about searching for big-time glory in a small-time town. In the play, Diskit is a high school chemistry genius who needs some friends, while Riley is a high school burnout who needs a new screamer for her heavy metal band. A local âBattle of the Bandsâ contest could transform them both from high school losers to rock gods, but will that be enough to get both girls out of Tucker, Georgia?

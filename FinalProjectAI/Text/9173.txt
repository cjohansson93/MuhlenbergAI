Campus Initiatives

Students, faculty and staff are invited and encouraged to participate in these campus-wide sustainability initiatives. Follow Muhlenberg College Sustainability on Facebook for updates!

Green TransportationHere are affordable ways to explore the local community while reducing your carbon footprint.

Bike-Share Program: Muhlenberg and the Allentown Parking Authority partnered with Zagster for a green and affordable way to get around campus and explore the city. Annual memberships are $10 for students, $25 for everyone else or bikes can be rented hourly. Sign-up information, area maps and more here.
Bring your own bike to campus and park it at one of the available indoor and outdoor bike racks.
Free LANTA Bus Service for Muhlenberg students, faculty and staff. The College provides access for all of students and employees to ride any LANTA bus, swipe their College ID card and travel throughout Lehigh and Northampton counties, seven days a week. The program includes two Chew Street bus stops right on Muhlenbergâs campus.
College shuttle services and other transportation options are also available for trips to shopping malls, grocery stores and regional airports.


 

Community GardenThe Muhlenberg Community Garden is a hands-on co-curricular learning space for students. In addition to the vegetables and flowers grown there, sustainability initiatives include a composting program, rainwater collection tanks and a permaculture garden, which is home to a collection of local plants and herbs. Two houses in front of the plots, the Garden House and the Treehouse, support the garden in a living-learning experiential environment. Located on the 2200 block of Chew Street, the garden is open to the entire campus community. Join the Muhlenberg Community Garden Facebook group for updates!

 
Just Tap It In response to a student initiative, the College installed over 35 filtered water stations on campus in 2010. As a result, purchases of bottled water on campus dropped by 92%. Each year, first-year students receive a reusable water bottle during Orientation.

 
Green TeamEach fall, the Green Team assists first-year students and families on Move-In Day. Comprised of student, faculty and staff volunteers, the team recycles cardboard boxes and styrofoam, provides orientation outreach, and answers questions about recycling, waste disposal, Just Tap It and campus sustainability. 

 
Earth DayCollege and community groups participate in an annual celebration spreading information about climate change action, organic farming, animal rights, divestiture and a variety of sustainability efforts on campus, including the Community Garden. Activities have included free and delicious vegetarian fare from the Dining Hall, a clothing share, handcrafted local artwork, demonstrations of an electric bike and solar-powered grill, and the always popular human-powered smoothie bike.

Watts Your Bergtricity?
The Watts Your Bergtricity? Dorm Energy Competition is an energy reduction competition between fifteen major campus residence halls. They earn points over a two-week period and the top-scoring hall wins prizes. Though the competition began in 2009, the goals remain the same: to reduce energy use, spark dialogue among the campus community and integrate sustainable behaviors into daily life. 

Stuff the Truck 
Each spring, campus volunteers help students "stuff the truck" with lightly used furniture and household items during spring move-out. These waste reduction efforts benefit Habitat for Humanity. The collaboration is made possible by the Office of Campus Sustainability, the Office of Community Engagement, Muhlenberg Dining and Habitat for Humanity.

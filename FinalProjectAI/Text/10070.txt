2015 Living Writers Schedule
The Muhlenberg College English Department offered the semester-long course Living Writers in Fall 2015, celebrating the 20th year of the program by bringing burgeoning and established authors to campus. In addition to interaction with students, each author held a public reading and book signing, both of which were open to the public.
Students enrolled in the course read recent works from the selected authors and then interacted with the writers directly as they visited campus for a day. Writers attended classes, had lunch with students and then gave a public reading of their work in the evening.
Fall 2015 Schedule:
All readings, except for Gaiman's, were free of charge.
Patricia Smith, poet Sept. 14, 7 p.m. - Miller Forum, Moyer Hall
Patricia Smith is the author of 6 poetry collections. More so, with 4 National Poetry Slam individual champions, Patricia is considered one of the world's best spoken word performers.
The Living Writers class is reading Blood Dazzler, which chronicles the emotional, physical and human toll exacted by Hurricane Katrina. This collection was a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award.
Stephen Kuusisto, memoirist and poet September 28, 7 p.m. - Miller Forum, Moyer Hall

Phil Klay's first published book, a short story collection, entitled Redeployment, won the 2015 National Book Award.

He served in Iraq's Anbar Province from January 2007 to February 2008 as a Public Affairs Officer.
Living Writers students are reading Redeployment.
Started in 1994, âLiving Writersâ is a course offered once every three years which brings six established and emerging writers to Muhlenberg College. The students read their recent works and then interact with the authors directly as they visit campus for a day. The writers come to class, have lunch with students and then give a public reading of their work in the evening. Each writer is interviewed on the collegeâs radio station and written up in the local newspaper. Their visit is a community event. In the past we have had the honor of hosting David Sedaris, Jonathan Franzen, Gary Snyder, Adrienne Rich, Francine Prose, Galway Kinnell, Robert Pinsky, Michael Ondaatje, and Phillip Levine.
The 2013 Living Writers series includes lectures by novelist Cristina GarcÃ­a; novelist, journalist and playwright Colm Toibin; poet and environmentalist Patrick Lawler; poet Kay Ryan; poet Terrance Hayes; and graphic novelist Chris Ware.

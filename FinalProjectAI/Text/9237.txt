Audience members who attended Muhlenberg's 169th Commencement, held on May 21, 2017, likely remember a pleasant, sunny morning on the College's front lawn. Ask the graduates and faculty, though, and they might recall sweating through their dark caps and gowns beneath a cloudless sky. Luckily, a special group of studentsâthe Cardinal Key Societyâwere on hand to assist.
âThe professors and deans were like, âI canât get up, but I need something to drink,ââ recalls Michael Bonaddio â20, a business administration and finance major who is vice president of the Cardinal Keys. âWe helped get them water and made sure everyone stayed cool.â
Though this yearâs Commencement forecast currently calls for plenty of clouds in the sky, the Cardinal Keys, an organization whose approximately 50 members help organize and staff various College events, will be working rain or shine. Whether festivities are held in Memorial Hall or on College Green, youâll find these studentsâdressed in bright red polos and khaki pants, or, as Michael jokes, âthe Target outfitââwith smiles on their faces, ready to answer questions, give directions and help in any other way theyâre needed.
âThey play a really important role in a lot of big campus eventsâwe always say that Alumni Weekend and Commencement couldnât happen without them,â says Emma Hamm â15, assistant director of alumni and parent engagement, co-advisor of the Cardinal Keys (with Tara Simpson â02, assistant director of alumni affairs) and a member of the group during her four years at Muhlenberg. âThey are our extra arms and legs but theyâre also filled with knowledge.â
The Cardinal Key Society dates back to 1940, when six members of the class of 1942 decided to form a group to help welcome visitors to campus. Today, the Keysâ biggest events are the ones Hamm mentioned, but members are also involved in Orientation Weekend, Honors Convocation, donor dinners and various other campus events.
âWeâre definitely a group that the College goes to to be the best representatives of the school, to put our best foot forward and to show Muhlenberg is a great place to be,â says Ashley Polera â20, an accounting and finance major who joined the Cardinal Keys her first year. âVisitors know if they look at a Key that weâre a student who loves Muhlenberg and that weâre there to help and offer support.â
And this Friday, âevery little thing people donât realize someone has to do, weâll be doing them,â Michael says, âand making sure the seniors and parents enjoy their last day on campus.â

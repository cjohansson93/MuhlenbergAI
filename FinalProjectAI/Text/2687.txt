despite loss, women’s lax makes playoffs


The bad news for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team was that it suffered a disappointing loss in the last game of the regular season. The good news is that it will
get a chance to avenge that loss very soon.

Despite a 22-19 setback to McDaniel, the Mules (11-4) clinched the much-desired Centennial 



Freshman Diana Ortiz played an important role in the late attempt to come back, controlling four draws in the second half.



Conference playoff berth, the first-ever in the program’s history. 

Following today’s league matches, three teams were in a tie for the 

last two remaining qualifying spots for the playoffs - McDaniel, Ursinus and Muhlenberg. The three 
squads finished with identical records (5-4), but the Green Terror secured the fourth place by virtue of goal differential in the head-to-head encounters between the three 
teams. The Mules earned the fifth seed thanks to their 13-8 victory in the direct clash with the Bears.

McDaniel and Muhlenberg will have the pleasure to meet up for second time in a span of only five days, as they will face each other in the opening round of the CC 
playoffs Wednesday on the campus of the Green Terror. 

At the end of this game against McDaniel, it looked like that the four Muhlenberg seniors (Taylor Armstrong, Marissa Capuano, Maura Lane and 
Kate Sawyer) had just played their last encounter in a Muhlenberg uniform, but the news about a 14-13 Ursinus loss to Dickinson meant they would have at least one 
more game in which to wear the Mule colors. 
 
The Muhlenberg fans, who had come to honor the four seniors and to support the team in its last home game of the season, witnessed an entertaining offensive production 
from both sides, which resulted in 41 combined goals. 

McDaniel, which desperately needed a victory to make the playoffs, came out firing in the first half and quickly opened an 11-3 bulge midway through the period.
 
The Green Terror was responding instantaneously to Muhlenberg’s attempts to conquer their net with goals of their own, maintaining the comfortable cushion until the 
dying minutes, when the Mules put up a late heroic five-goal effort, which fell short as the hosts ran out of time.
 
For the hosts, junior Ruth Morrongiello scored five goals, while classmate Sara Hiller finished with four.

Mens golf defends home turf 





On a day featuring conditions that were less than conducive for low scores, the Muhlenberg mens golf team went just low enough at Lehigh Country Club.
 
The Mules weathered the cool, breezy and sometimes rainy conditions to a post a team total of 324, three strokes better than Messiah, to claim the Muhlenberg Fall Invitational for the first time since 2007.

Senior Zachary Oyer led the Mules with a six-over-par 76. Oyer, who shot six-over-par for the front nine, got his game under control to finish in a tie for second-place. And after comparing scorecards, he claimed the runner-up trophy. 



I started out pretty bad; I was just forcing it on the front nine, Oyer said. But then I started to adjust to the greens and get comfortable.

This is one of the most difficult courses we play. The greens are fast and undulating, and you have to know where to hit the ball. You can hit a good shot and have it roll off the green. So knowing the course was a huge advantage for us today and it helped me regroup after my bad start.

Chris DiMaio (81), Brandon Davis (83) and Matthew Cohen (84) rounded out the Mule scorers; all three finished in the top 20. Muhlenbergs Zack Meyers, who was competing as an individual, joined Oyer in the top 10 with a 10-over-par 80.

The win gives Muhlenberg its second team title of the fall season, and second Muhlenberg Fall Invitational crown in the past 10 years. The Mules have also finished in the top three in four of their five events this fall, and are the defending champions at their only remaining tournament, the Messiah Falon Classic. 






But according to Oyer, this win felt better. Not only did the Mules defend their home course, but they also had the luxury of being just minutes from home. 


Its really nice to not have to get in a van and drive for a few hours, Oyer said with a laugh. Although were all 20 or 21 years old, we still feel like old men when weve been cramped in a van for so long.

 We really wanted to get this win on our home course. This feels really good and hopefully we can finish the fall season with back-to-back wins tomorrow.

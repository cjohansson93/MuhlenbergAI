Fall 2021 Information
Wednesday, April 28, 2021

To the Muhlenberg Community,
Last week we shared the announcement that we will return to campus this fall to live, learn and engage with one another in a full residential experience. Part of our decision was based on current vaccination rates in concert with our safety guidelines and protocols.
From the beginning of the pandemic, we grounded our decisions in the scientific evidence available to us. Since our last communication, we have completed a thorough review of the information about the three current vaccines and have consulted with local and national health and infectious disease experts, public health specialists and other critical resources.
There is an abundance of information in support of vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccine supply and availability and a clear sense of the critical importance of the vaccine in congregant living settings. Therefore, Muhlenberg College will require all students to be vaccinated for the 2021-2022 academic year. We strongly encourage faculty and staff to be vaccinated as well and have hosted onsite vaccine clinics that drew strong participation from our community.
The public health measures we implemented this year have helped us to keep our community safe and allowed us to return to campus this spring. For the fall semester, we want the experience to be more engaging and less restrictive to every extent possible for our community.
Like other vaccines that the College requires, we will have a clear policy that will allow for exemptions based on medical or religious reasons. Muhlenberg will continue to consult with local health experts as we finalize equitable policy language and procedures for exemption. Health Services will share more detailed information and deadlines for students to provide proof of immunization.
In the weeks ahead we will join together for events like Honors Convocation and Commencement to celebrate and commemorate our studentsâ achievements. This is only a snapshot of the tremendous work we, as a campus community, have collectively accomplished. I encourage you to take time to celebrate the large and small moments as we reflect on this year and look excitedly ahead to the fall.
Best wishes to all for a successful end to the semester.
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringPresident

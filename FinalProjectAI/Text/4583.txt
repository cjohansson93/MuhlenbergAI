goals to defeat McDaniel, 3-0, for their first victory of the season. Muhlenberg (1-3-2) will play its first home game, ironically, at Homecoming, next Saturday.

It took a little while for Muhlenberg's fortunes to change. Against a team they 
hadn't lost to since 2003, the Mules only had a 6-4 advantage in shots in the first half, which ended without a score. It didn't help that Miller left the game with a broken finger in the fourth minute.

"It started off a little slow in the first half," she said. "In the second half it came together - we found feet and were able to get good scoring opportunities."

Muhlenberg outshot the Green Terror, 20-5, in the second 45 minutes and put the first goal on the board when freshman CJ Graetzer headed in a cross from sophomore Alyssa Meola 7:44 into the half.

Miller and her wrapped finger took care of putting the game out of reach, scoring twice in a span of less than four minutes for her fourth career multiple-goal game.

Junior Michele Toher recorded six saves for her 10th career shutout.

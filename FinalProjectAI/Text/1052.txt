Message to Study Abroad Students from the Office of Global Education
Tuesday, February 25, 2020

Dear Colleagues, Parents, Guardians, and Students in Europe,â¯â¯â¯ 
Even though you are not on a program in Italy, I am writing to update you onâ¯the reported cases of coronavirus in northern Italy, the measures implemented by the Italian authorities and steps to take to help keep your students healthy. We share your concerns and are diligently monitoring the situation through official channels while following the guidelines that the U.S. government, Italian government and AACUPI (Association of American Colleges and University Programs in Italy) have been issuing.
Italyâs health minister announced restrictions in the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, whose capitals are the cities of Milan and Venice respectively. Italian authorities are working to track down the first carrier of the virus in the country and have instituted several emergency measures, including the closure of public buildings, limiting transportation and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. The prime minister announced that it no one would be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas without special permission, and any who disobey the restrictions could reportedly face prosecution.
Outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities. There are many study abroad programs in Italy, some of which are run by U.S. colleges or universities and many more that are run in-country by host institutions through partner programs. Muhlenberg students are enrolled in one of these in-country partner programs. The on-site staff at our host programs in Italy have informed our students that classes are currently continuing. If local authorities require a suspension of activities, the institutions will comply. In addition, students have been asked to avoid traveling to the affected areas.
We are glad the Italian government has moved quickly to put strict controls in place to contain the spreading of the virus and we hope these measures lead to a containment of the virus soon.
In addition to monitoring by the Muhlenberg Committee for Health and Safety and the College senior staff, the senior staff of our providers in Italy continue to haveâ¯close and regular communication with us and with students about their well-being and we willâ¯all work to keep them apprisedâ¯ofâ¯safety or academicâ¯updates.â¯Students who have additional questions or concernsâ¯should contact the local provider staff for the quickest and best support. Parents with concerns are best assisted by contacting their students who are receiving more frequent updates from the local teams. 
Based on our continuous contact with our host staff members at our sites in Rome, Florence and Arezzo, we are confident they are doing the best job possible to monitor information and to provide sound advice to our students. 
In particular, we and the host teams are all advising our students to:

Check email regularly for important updates from the provider or the host university.
Consult the CDC website, for the most up-to-date information regarding enhanced screening procedures: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/
Review the Department of Stateâs COVID-19 Travel Alert: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-coronavirus-hubei-province--china.html
Get notifications from: step.state.gov and https://it.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-rome.../
Monitor reputable news sources and the U.S. embassy/consulates in Italy https://it.usembassy.gov/news-events/ for updates on the situation.
Practice good hygiene:

Wash hands frequently with warm soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If you do not have access to soap and water use alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce risk of infection.
Use a tissue or sleeve on the crook of the arm to cover sneeze or cough, then wash hands.
Avoid touching mucous membranes (eyes, nose and mouth).


Avoid close personal contact with potentially infected individuals.
DO NOT travel to areas with quarantines or high infection rates.
Have a supply of OTC drugs such as Tylenol or anti-inflammatory. 

If a student is feeling weak or not well:

Inform the programâs office of Student Services immediately to get medical attention;
Stay in the student residence;
Wear a mask;
Drink plenty of fluids;
Rest;

Note: All programs will be issuing policies for how to make up work for missed classes.
We recommend students enroll in the smart traveler enrollment program: https://step.state.gov/
A student who voluntarily leaves their program must notify the Muhlenberg College Office of Global Education and the proper personnel on-site before departure. 
The Muhlenberg Committee for Health and Safetyâwhich includes the College president, provost, chief business officer, health director, dean of student affairs, director of the public health program, study abroad student coordinator and myselfâmet this morning and remains up-to-date on the latest information. Additionally, our health director is in communication with the Allentown Health Bureau and will consult with the Lehigh Valley Health Network Infectious Disease Department if warranted by conditions.
Further questions regarding health concerns should be directed to our Health Director Brynnmarie Dorsey at Dorsey@muhlenberg.edu.
Sincerely,
Donna M. Kish-Goodling, Ph.D.Professor - Economics
Dean - Global Education

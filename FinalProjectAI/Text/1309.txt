The International Students Association (ISA) works toward promoting diversity within the Muhlenberg community.
Every other week, ISA members meet and enjoy the activity of the week. Often international students have presentations about their home countries. These presentations tend to enhance ISA membersâ understanding regarding that particular culture and group of people.
ISA also organizes activities on campus, such as highlighting New Years' celebrations from different countries. ISA strives to highlight the power of multiculturalism and spread awareness of the ways students can become better global citizens.

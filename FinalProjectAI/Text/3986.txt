Men’s Tennis Wins CC Finale




In its last Centennial Conference match of the season, the Muhlenberg mens tennis team outlasted Ursinus, 5-4.

The Mules (3-10, 2-7) trailed 2-1 after doubles play but captured four of six singles matches. The pivotal match was a No. 4, where freshman Ben Berkowitz came back after a 6-1 loss in the first set to win in a third-set supertiebreaker, 10-8.

Junior Andrew Brod won at both doubles and singles, teaming with senior Wayne Mitchel (above) for an 8-6 victory at No. 3 doubles.

Other singles winners for Muhlenberg were senior Robbie Goldwein and junior Ben Cohen.

It what amounted to a playoff game, the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team closed out its season with a 6-3 loss at Ursinus.

Both teams entered the game in the middle of a four-team scramble for the fourth and final CC playoff spot, and with the way other 



games went, the winner of the Muhlenberg-Ursinus matchup would earn that final berth.

The Mules (5-9, 2-6) struggled to set up their offense and took only four shots in the first half, which ended with Ursinus ahead, 5-1. Muhlenberg scored twice in the third quarter to cut the deficit in half, but the Bears (9-5, 4-4) netted the lone goal of the final period.

Seniors Mike Horowitz and Tom Brant finished their careers with outstanding performances. Horowitz (right) made 13 saves to keep the Mules in the game despite a 39-16 disadvantage in shots, and Brant caused six turnovers and picked up six ground balls to move into second place on the program's all-time
list with 158 ground balls.

Seniors Zachary Armstrong (goal) and Brent Siebold (assist) each recorded a point in their Mule finales, while senior Andy Curley picked up two ground balls.

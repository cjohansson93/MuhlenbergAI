Josh Mosberg started the third overtime looking for a rock to hide behind and ended it in a big celebration pile.

The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team overcame a penalty by Mosberg to defeat Franklin & Marshall, 9-8, on a goal by senior Kyle Farris 1:07 into the third extra period. The Mules (4-4, 2-3) prevailed despite squandering an 8-3 fourth-quarter lead.

Assisting on the winning goal was senior Mickey Norton – his school-record-

tying fifth assist of the game. Norton also became the program’s all-time leading scorer, as his five points increased his career total to 110.

Mosberg, whose unassisted goal with 11:12 left in the third gave Muhlenberg a 5-3 lead, was called for an illegal body check with 28 seconds left in the second overtime.

“I think it was my first collegiate penalty, and it was definitely the wrong time to get it,” said the senior midfielder. “I was just being aggressive, trying to get the ball back.

“When I was sitting in the box, it was the worst feeling,” he added. “In overtime it’s golden goal, so if they score there’s no redemption.”

The Diplomats (7-3, 3-2) scored five man-up goals in regulation and did put one in soon after Mosberg’s penalty, but they were called for a crease violation, turning the ball over to the Mules.

Muhlenberg opened the third overtime with possession of the ball, and after a Farris shot was saved, Norton was pushed in the back by an F&M defenseman, drawing a 30-second penalty. Three seconds after the penalty expired, Farris caught Norton’s pass from behind the cage and ripped it low to high for his second career overtime game-winner.

Farris finished with five points on four goals and an assist to reach the 100-point milestone for his career, but the team milestones carried more weight. The Mules had never won back-to-back Centennial Conference games before, and they had come away from their previous two trips to Lancaster with 14-3 and 10-2 losses.

“We lost to them last year [at home], so there was a little vendetta,” said Mosberg. “But more importantly if we lose another Centennial Conference game we have no chance of getting to the playoffs, so it was monumental that we pull it out.”

Muhlenberg was down 3-2 early in the second quarter before seizing apparent control. The Mules scored the next six goals – two by sophomore Paul Munday - and kept the Diplomats off the scoreboard for more than 30 minutes. Then things started to get away.

“We got kid of slack, and once they scored a couple of goals they got momentum, and we couldn’t keep possession long enough,” explained Mosberg. “The biggest thing we have to work on is learning how to finish games.”

F&M scored five straight goals, the last a man-up goal with just four seconds left in regulation, to tie the score. Both teams had scoring chances in the first two overtimes, with Farris hitting the post twice.

Sophomore Andrew Bell made 13 saves for Muhlenberg, and freshman Tom Brant picked up a game-high seven ground balls.

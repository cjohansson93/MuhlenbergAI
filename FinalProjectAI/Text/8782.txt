Scholarships, Fellowships and Awards
The Dean of Academic Life seeks to assist undergraduates and recent graduates engage in a process of reflection upon their education â â inside and outside the classroom â â their values and their life goals in order to enhance success in applying for opportunities that will enable them to realize their goals (e.g. nationally prestigious awards, graduate or professional study).
Opportunities include significant student research and presentation, study abroad and meaningful volunteer and service-learning work. The process acknowledges the different levels of readiness of students, from the first year through postgraduate study. Included are many opportunities to work with faculty awards advisors and the Dean, including an intensive mock application and interview program during the Junior year, whose reward is a $1000 Presidential Scholarship. Hundreds of national and international awards, finalist statuses and honorable mentions have been earned by Muhlenberg students and recent graduates.
Whether students receive an award or not, the process has helped all students get to know themselves better and present themselves better in future competitions and in postgraduate careers. Close work with faculty who teach, advise and inspire these students is central to success.

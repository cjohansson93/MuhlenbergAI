Jeff Rudski, Ph.D.
 Professor Psychobiology and Learning Moyer Hall - Room 223 484.664.3486 Fax: 484.664.5627
Background D.E.C., Vanier College, B.Sc., McGill University, Ph.D., University of Minnesota
Dr. Rudski teaches Biological Psychology, Psychopharmacology, Learning & Behavior, Advanced Research in Psychology, Introduction to Psychology, and additional courses relating to his research interests.
My academic and research interests are quite eclectic. In the past few years, students and I have published papers or given conference presentations dealing with such disparate topics as addiction theory, risk perception, neuroethics, stigma and disability, psychology of superstition, behavioral endocrinology, and judgment and decision making. Several themes run through most of these projects. First, there is the tension between the rational and intuitive basis of human thought and behavior-stated another way as the tension between thinking with your head versus knowing with your heart. This interest goes back to my college days when I was deeply influenced by the English poet/philosopher William Blake's writings on how human nature is a balance of reason and passion/emotion, and pervades my research on superstition, judgment and decision making, and risk perception. Second, my background in and life experiences with disabilities advocacy has given me an appreciation of neurodiversity, which in turn is guiding my research on stigma. Finally, my graduate training in behavioral pharmacology has resulted in a career-long curiosity about acceptability, social influences, and ethics of drug use, including instances of recreational, psychiatric, and cosmetic usage.

Womens lax gets back to winning ways 


Before this week the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team hadnt lost back-to-back regular season games in roughly three years. Against Bryn Mawr it wasnt about to make it three in a row.




DeCarle notched her first point of the year with an assist on Rosens second goal.





The Mules scored early and often in a 20-3 rout of the Owls, getting back on the winning track they have become so accustomed to and picking up their first Centennial Conference win of the season.

Its definitely nice to get back to winning, said junior Lauren DeCarle. This will really bring us momentum going into next week.

Muhlenberg (6-3, 1-2) will need that momentum as it prepares for a difficult three-game stretch against three of the other CC playoff participants from a year ago: Dickinson, McDaniel and second-ranked and defending national champion Franklin & Marshall. Over the same string last season the Mules clipped Dickinson by two and McDaniel by one in overtime en route to beating both teams out for the third seed in the playoffs.




Senior Alyssa Bascelli led the Mules with three assists, two of which came on the first two goals of the game.






Against Bryn Mawr (0-8, 0-3) the Mules built a big cushion early and cruised from there. They scored six times in the first five minutes and netted the first 11 goals of the game before the Owls got the last one of the first half.

Two Mules recorded their first career hat tricks in the victory. Sophomore Kelsey Elmer and freshman Alex Bellini both accomplished the feat for the first time, while junior Danielle Rosen did it for the seventh this time season.

Two others scored their first career goals. Sophomore Becky Ritter found the back of the net late in the second half, and freshman Lauren Ellison followed suit 2:11 later. Sophomore Sarah Hetrick scored twice to post her first career multi-goal game.

One of the most important things for this team is everyone getting to contribute, commented DeCarle. We emphasize that everyone is important. A game like today builds confidence and brings everyone together.

Freshman Molly Davin and sophomore Angela Napoletano also scored twice each. DeCarle tied for team highs with four ground balls and three draw controls. Elmer also picked up four ground balls.

Policy for Partisan Political Activity
As a liberal arts institution, Muhlenberg College respects the freedom of speech for all individuals and, as a community, we are committed to civil dialogue and respect for others' opinions. The College has a policy regarding candidate appearances, political fundraising and partisan political activity. Because we are a 501c non-profit institution, we must adhere to certain regulations. Here is the College's policy on partisan political activity.

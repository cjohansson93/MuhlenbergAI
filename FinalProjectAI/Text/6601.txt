Four Mule Teams Beaten
 Wednesday, September 19, 2012







					 



Sunny skies returned to Muhlenberg after a day of heavy rain, but tough opponents rained on the Mules, sending four women’s teams down to defeat.

In the only home event, women’s tennis fell to Stevens, 7-2, in its lone home match of the fall. Stevens came within one point of winning its conference championship last year.

Scoring points for the Mules with singles wins were sophomores Sharen Resnikoff at No. 2 and Jennifer Goldberg at No. 3. Resnikoff posted an impressive 6-1, 6-1 win against an opponent who brought in a perfect 5-0 record in dual matches, while Goldberg won her second set at love.

Women’s soccer (2-5-1, 0-2) took Haverford, ranked fifth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, to double overtime and were less than three minutes away from a scoreless draw when the Fords scored off a corner kick. 

Freshman Francesca Cobuzzi (right) tied her career high with eight saves. The Mule defense has allowed only eight goals in the last seven games, with three of them coming in one game to fourth-ranked Messiah. Four of the last five Muhlenberg games have ended 1-0, two of them in overtime.

In a matchup of two field hockey teams receiving national attention, undefeated and 12th-ranked Haverford shut out Muhlenberg, 2-0. The Mules (4-2, 1-1) had the better of play for most of the first half, but the Fords scored off a penalty corner after time expired and added an insurance goal early in the second half.

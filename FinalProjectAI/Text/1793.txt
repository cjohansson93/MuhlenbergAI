Terraces A, B, & C
Floor: N/A
Cannot Be Reserved
Beside Trexler Libraryâs main staircase are three large terraces that serve as open study spaces for all patrons. They have been furnished with group work tables, couches, lounge chairs, and side tables, making these spaces suited for a variety of purposes, whether it be individual work, group brainstorming, or downtime. The architecture of these spaces makes it difficult to control volume, so we ask all patrons to please be mindful of others when working in groups.



A-Level Technology
Floor: A-Level
Cannot Be Reserved
Technology on A-Level includes several desktop PCs, cloud-based printers with the capacity for copying and scanning documents, stations designated for watching DVD/Blu-ray films, and more. Check out our Library Technology page to find out more about the different technology the library has to offer. 



Periodicals Reading Lounge
Floor: A-Level
Cannot Be Reserved
Our Periodical Reading Lounge is filled with comfortable seating and side tables and is surrounded by the two most recent publications of various newspapers and magazines, including Lehigh Valley Business, the Sunday Times, and the Harvard Law and Business Reviews. Many of these resources and more are available online for current Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff through Encompass Search on our website and Flipster Digital Magazines.



Seminar A
Floor: A-Level
Can Be Reserved By: Faculty/Staff
Seminar A is equipped with a TV, DVD Player, and mounted whiteboard, allowing it to serve multiple purposes as a private study room or video-viewing room when necessary. It is also furnished with a couch and several chairs. It can be reserved in advance by faculty and staff members but is available to all patrons when not in use. 
To reserve Seminar A: Contact the library's Administrative Assistant, Lindsay Liiro, at 484-664-3551 or lindsayliiro@muhlenberg.edu.  



B-03: One Button Studio
Floor: B-Level
Can Be Reserved By: Students/Faculty/Staff
The One Button Studio is a simplified video recording setup that can be used without any previous video production experience. The design of the studio allows you to create high-quality and polished video projects without having to know anything about lights and cameras. It is located on B-level of Trexler Library and sits diagonally across from the elevator. 
To reserve the One Button Studio: Visit its reservation page. The One Button Studio can be reserved in advance by all Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff. Reservations are given priority, but are not required for use.



B-04: Collaboration Room
Floor: B-Level
Can Be Reserved By: Students/Faculty/Staff
The Collaboration Room is a workspace where patrons can gather and work together on joint tasks. The room has a table with both HDMI and VGA cables that can be plugged into a computer and then cast onto the wall monitor.  A maximum of four devices can be plugged in at once, allowing students to seamlessly switch between their individual displays to showcase their work and ideas to the room. In addition to collaborative technology, this space is additionally equipped with a mounted whiteboard. The Collaboration Room is a perfect solution when determining where to do group work. 
To reserve the Collaboration Room: Visit its reservation page. The Collaboration Room can be reserved in advance by all Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff. Otherwise, it functions as an open study space for students. 



Quiet Studies
Floor: C-Level
Cannot Be Reserved
C-Level has four Quiet Studies, all identical in size and equipment. These enclosed studies include a collaborative work table that can seat up to four students, as well as a mounted whiteboard and chalkboard. These studies are not soundproof, so occupants need to be mindful of their speaking volumes.
These are open study spaces that cannot be reserved, but priority will be given to groups when space is limited. 



Seminar C
Floor: C-Level
Can Be Reserved By: Students/Faculty/Staff
Similar to the Quiet Study Rooms, but much larger, Seminar C houses a large work table for collaborative projects, as well as includes a mounted whiteboard. This space is not soundproof, so occupants need to be mindful of their speaking volumes. 
To reserve Seminar C: Visit its reservation page. Seminar C can be reserved in advance by all Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff. Otherwise, it functions as an open study space when not in use.

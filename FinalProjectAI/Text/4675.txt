women’s basketball falls in first round





Chili ended the season with 471 points, second all-time at Muhlenberg and just nine shy of the school record she set as a freshman.






A slow start doomed the Muhlenberg womens basketball team in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, as the Mules trailed big early and could never climb all the way back in a 71-59 loss to Tufts.

The loss ends Muhlenbergs season at 21-6. Though the 2009-10 squad did not advance as far in the NCAAs as last years, it became the first in Muhlenberg womens basketball history to earn at at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament and the first to win 20 games in three consecutive seasons.

Just to make it to the tournament is an accomplishment, said senior Kaitlyn OMalley. We set goals at the beginning of every season and we did a good job with them.

It was a sad end to a happy

season, she added.

The Mules struggled mightily to open the game, making just one field goal in the first 6:51 and falling behind 18-3. A pair of free throws by sophomore Alexandra Chili cut the deficit to nine at 23-14, but the Jumbos (21-5) responded with a 7-0 run. Chili drained a three with 45 seconds left before halftime to make it a 12-point game going into the break.

Muhlenberg opened the second half hot and used a full-court press to try to claw back into the game. Chili hit another triple to cut the lead to seven at the 15:11 mark, and then, after Tufts responded with a jumper, sophomore Kathleen Naddaff fought through a double team and made a great pass to senior Maiza Mock for a layup.

A Chili layup off an inbound cut the deficit to five, and a pair of free throws by junior Kelly McKeon after a brief Tufts run again made it five, this time at 50-45. But that was as close as the Mules would get, as the Jumbos eventually went on a 10-1 run to put the game away.

We came out in the second half like we wanted to, said OMalley. We wanted to run and press and make them play at our tempo, and we did. They did make another run, but we were happy with the way we played.

Junior Sheila Cook led the Mules with 20 points, and Chili finished with 18 points and seven rebounds.

Muhlenbergs four seniors  OMalley, Mock, Alexis Bates and Brenna Ferster  ended their careers with a record of 87-24, the second-most wins by a class in team history, two Centennial Conference championships and three straight trips to the NCAA Tournament.

Its been so much fun, said OMalley. All four years weve grown together, and Ive had the time of my life. These girls are my best friends, and to have experienced this with them has been so special.

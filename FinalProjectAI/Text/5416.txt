Women’s soccer advances to semis



Men’s Soccer Eliminated in Overtime


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was unlucky at the start and lost to Dickinson, 1-0, in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs. 

In the first seven minutes, the Mules hit a post and a crossbar. As often happens, those missed early chances came back to haunt them.

The game was scoreless after 90 minutes of regulation. Just 1:32 into overtime, the Red Devils brought a sudden end to the game off a throw-in. The ball was headed out by a Muhlenberg defender back to the thrower, who ripped a shot into the upper corner.

Dickinson (12-4-2) goes on to the semifinals to meet top-seeded Swarthmore. The Mules end their season with a 12-6-1 record.

Joseph Gogel, one of seven seniors playing his last game, made a career-high 11 saves.

So much for experience being the top factor in the postseason.

Starting a freshman goalie and getting two goals from freshmen, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team advanced to the semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs with a come-from-behind 2-1 win against Haverford.

Haverford (8-10-1), seeking its first playoff win, struck early, scoring a goal just 5:42 into the game. That was one of only two shots the Fords would take in the first half, however, as Muhlenberg settled down after an uneven start.

The Mules tied the score midway through the first half after freshman Meghan O’Grady was tripped going after a ball in the corner. Junior Kasey Hacker’s free kick went off the head of junior Jayne Condon, then off the head of freshman Nicolette Miller and headed toward the goal. A Ford back stabbed at the ball but could not keep it from going in.

It was the 10th goal of the season for Miller, who came in leading the CC in points.

The game-winning goal was similarly unconventional. Freshman Renee Dessimone took a throw-in on the right side and sent a high cross toward the goal. The Haverford goalie leapt to intercept the ball, but it went over her outstretched hand, bounced once and settled into the back of the net at the far post for Dessimone’s ninth goal of the season.

Neither team had a great chance to score in the second half, and Muhlenberg held on for the win, improving its all-time postseason record to 13-6-1.

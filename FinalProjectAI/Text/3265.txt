Empty Day at Dickinson for Women’s Teams


The Muhlenberg field hockey, volleyball and women’s soccer teams all returned from Dickinson on the wrong side of the ledger.

Field hockey lost 1-0 on a goal midway through the first half for its fourth one-goal setback of the season. Volleyball was swept in three sets for its third consecutive Centennial Conference loss. Women’s soccer gave up a goal 4:01 into the first half and another 3:57 into the second half and lost, 3-1.

A win at Johns Hopkins still proves elusive for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team, but the Mules made some measure of progress by earning a point.

Muhlenberg (6-3-1, 2-1-1) and Johns Hopkins (9-2-2, 3-0-1) played a scoreless draw  in a matchup of the two teams who have combined to win 12 of the 15 Centennial Conference championships. The Blue Jays came into the game ranked 23rd in Division III.

The Mules have never beaten Hopkins at Homewood Field. This was the third draw (all scoreless) between the two squads in Baltimore, but the first in the regular season. The previous two ties came in the 2002 and 2004 CC playoffs, and the Blue Jays went on to win the shootout both times.

Hopkins had not been shut out at home in a CC regular-season contest since early in the 2005 season.

The game concluded a stretch in which Muhlenberg played its first four CC games of 2008 against the other four teams that qualified for the 2007 CC playoffs. The Mules came out with a 2-1-1 mark, allowing only one goal in the four games.

Overall, Muhlenberg has conceded one goal in its last 542 minutes.

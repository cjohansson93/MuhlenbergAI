Four wrestlers place at W&L 



Turnovers Plague Men’s Basketball


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team made it interesting, but in the end it could not overcome a plethora of turnovers in falling, 65-58, at Washington.

The loss drops the Mules (8-6, 6-2) back into a three-way tie for first 



 
Foster’s double-double was the fifth of his career.



place in the Centennial Conference with Franklin & Marshall and Gettysburg, both winners at home.

Despite holding a 47-24 advantage in rebounds, Muhlenberg was done in by 31 turnovers, many of which came on a staggering amount of illegal screen calls.

Washington led for much of the first half and took its biggest lead of the period, 28-23, with 2:29 left. But the Mules ended the half with six unanswered points, on a three-pointer from senior Ryan Foster and a three-point play by senior Obi Nwizugbo, to enter the break leading by one.

Muhlenberg continued its run to start the second half, scoring seven straight. But the Shoremen (7-5, 5-3) responded with a 17-2 run, going from down eight to up seven in an eight-minute span.

The lead grew to 55-43 with 6:36 before the Mules started slowly chipping away at it. A jumper by sophomore Spencer Liddic and a pair of free throws from senior Brian Frankoski brought Muhlenberg to within six, 62-56, with 1:23 remaining. But a charge call and a pair of missed threes in the final minute ended the comeback attempt.

Liddic and Foster both recorded double-doubles. Liddic had 11 points and 18 rebounds, the most rebounds by a Mule in four years, and Foster had 15 and 10. Nwizugbo added 10 points and seven boards.

Four members of the Muhlenberg wrestling team reached the final or consolation final at the Washington and Lee Invitational, coming away with a second-place finish, two third and a fourth.

Sophomore John Sternlicht was responsible for the second-place finish, dropping a 
two-point decision to the top-seeded wrestler at 174. 

Sophomore Kevin Homan (above) came in third at 141, winning two consolation bouts. Homan was pinned in his first bout by the tournament’s Most Outstanding Wrestler, a Waynesburg athlete who pinned his three opponents in a total of 4:10. Homan lasted the longest on the mat against him (2:05) and came back with a pin and a 2-0 decision against an opponent from Johns Hopkins in the third-place bout.

Freshman Chris Galletta, making his debut for the Mules, placed third at heavyweight by scoring a pin in his second bout. Sophomore Nick Pallotta, competing at 197 for the first time, split four bouts to finish fourth.

The Mules came in sixth in the team standings.

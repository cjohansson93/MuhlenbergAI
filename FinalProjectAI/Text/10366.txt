The Muhlenberg community is composed of students, alumni, parents and friends who believe in the College and our students, and who want to build a brighter future together. Philanthropic support to the College touches all corners of campus life and is vital to the institutionâs wellbeing. We are grateful to our donors for their generous support, and we recognize the invaluable impact they have on the Muhlenberg community.
Students invest in themselves and their fellow students by supporting campus organizations and athletics teams; alumni give back to the College by paying it forward for future generations of students; and parents contribute so that other students can have their own unique Muhlenberg experience, just as their children had. These are just a few reasons why members of our community support Muhlenberg.
Scroll through our online honor roll and read more about why our donors give and their impact on our students.

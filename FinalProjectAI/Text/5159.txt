conti repeats on academicall-district team


For the second year in a row, senior Christian Conti of the Muhlenberg baseball team was named to the ESPN the Magazine 
Academic All-District II College Division team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 

A second-team selection last year, Conti made the first team this time around and will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America honors.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of 
Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a 
sophomore with a 3.3 cumulative grade-point average and a starter or significant reserve on his team. 

A finance major and philosophy minor, Conti earned second-team All-Centennial Conference honors in 2009 after hitting a team-leading .356 with five
home runs and 23 RBI. He was the 2008 CC player of the year and an all-region selection as a junior, when he led Division III in triples and set 
numerous school records, including most triples (11), home runs (11) and RBI (60) in a season.

Conti ended his career as the program’s all-time leader in extra-base hits (55) and slugging percentage (.669). He also was sixth in batting
average (.358), second in triples (18) and home runs (17) and fourth in RBI (95).

When Amisha Datta '21 pictured her college experience, she figured sheâd join her schoolâs Indian Student Association. Amishaâs parents are both from India, and while she was born in the United States, she lived in India for a year and a half before her family moved to China. After Kim Nguyen '07, Muhlenbergâs international student coordinator at the time, visited Amishaâs high school in Shanghai, she liked her first impressions enough to pay a visit to campus.
But though her class was to be among the most diverse Muhlenberg had ever enrolled, she could see the College was predominantly white. While there is an International Student Association (ISA) at Muhlenberg, thereâs not an Indian Student Association specifically. Still, Nguyen connected Amisha with Taj Singh '19, one of the founders of Top Naach Dance Club, a Bollywood dance group thatâs open to students of all backgrounds. To Amisha, it seemed a perfect fit.
âIâve been a dancer my whole life,â Amisha says. âDance is an easy way to show people a culture. You just have to watch. You donât have to know anything to understand it.â
Now, in her first semester on campus, Amisha is helping to choreograph Top Naachâs fall routine. The club will make its current-academic-year debut at the International Week Performance Night that caps off International Week, a cultural celebration that begins today. (The full schedule is available below.)
International Week evolved out of a single-day food and performance festival hosted by the department of languages, literatures & cultures. Two years ago, the department began partnering with the ISA to expand the programming.
âStudents on this campus have wonderful opportunities around them to learn from other students about their cultures,â says Eileen McEwan, associate professor of French and department chair of languages, literatures & cultures. âInternational Week is meant to showcase these other cultures and languages and to explore what it means to be a global citizen.â
At a College like Muhlenberg, dance is an especially effective way to do that, Taj says. âIf it was at another institution of the same size, not as many people might join or be interested,â he says. âA lot more people on this campus have prior experience with dance.â
Top Naachâs two major performances are timed to coincide roughly with Diwali, the festival of light, in the fall and Holi, the festival of colors (see above), in the spring. But thereâs an upside to being a part of the International Week Performance Night: âNot only can we perform there, but our members can stay and watch other cultural performances,â Taj says. âWe want to educate people on Indian culture, religions and stereotypes, and every other group performing is trying to find ways to do the same with their cultures. "It's a fun and engaging way to do it, instead of it being a passive and serious conversation, which can sometimes discourage people from getting involved.â

the CC moved to one division in 2002; Johns Hopkins was the favorite by three points over Dickinson in
2007.

Neither Muhlenberg nor Gettysburg won the CC championship last year, but the Mules took the regular-season title and the Bullets advanced to the "Sweet 16" of
the NCAA Tournament. CC playoff champion McDaniel was tabbed fifth in the preseason poll.

Muhlenberg, which also received 13 votes in the D3hoops.com preseason poll
and 5 in the Women's Basketball Coaches Association preseason poll,
, returns its top six 
scorers from last year's team that went 21-6, was ranked as high as 11th in Division III and earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history.

There was nothing close about where the men landed in the poll, as they were 29 points behind third-place Ursinus and 23 ahead of fifth-place Washington.
Franklin & Marshall received 15 of 20 first-place votes and was the favorite to repeat.

Muhlenberg finished with a 13-14 record and qualified for the CC playoffs as the fifth seed last year. The Mules won their first-round game at Ursinus
before falling to F&M in the semis. F&M would go on to advance to the national quarterfinals.

The men's team returns less experience than the women's team, as four of the top six scorers from last winter graduated.

The 2010-11 season tips off at Muhlenberg with a home doubleheader against Moravian on Monday, Nov. 15. The 29th Scotty Wood Tournament begins that Friday, two weeks
from tomorrow.

For a full preview of the CC basketball season, you can join live chats with the league coaches next week. The men will talk about the season on Wednesday,
Nov. 10, and the women on Thursday, Nov. 11, at 1:00 each day. Links to the chat will be available at 
www.centennial.org.

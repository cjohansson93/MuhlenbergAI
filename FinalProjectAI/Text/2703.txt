softball gets offensive vs. hounds


On paper, a Moravian pitching staff that had shut out 10 of its last 11 opponents appeared to be the last 


Women’s Tennis Rolls On



The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team tuned up for Saturday’s important Centennial Conference match at Swarthmore by defeating Elizabethtown, 8-1.

This was the sixth straight victory for the Mules (7-2), all by 8-1 or better.  It is the first time in the 50-year history of the team that it has won six in a row by such a decisive margin.

The most impressive win came from freshman Caitie Druker, playing at No. 1 singles for the second time. She defeated the Commonwealth Conference player of the year, 6-0, 6-1.

Freshmen Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt extended their doubles winning streak to eight with an 8-4 victory at No. 3.

thing the Muhlenberg softball team needed, but the Mules had one of their best offensive days of the season in a doubleheader loss.

Held to one run or fewer in 10 of its previous 13 games, Muhlenberg plated eight runs in dropping two close games, 7-5 and 4-3.

Leading the charge was freshman Ashley Brewer, who had three doubles

and drove in five runs on the day. Her two-out, bases-clearing double in the bottom of the fourth gave the Mules (5-19) a 5-0 lead in game one. 

Freshman Jess Kasza started 

the fourth inning by hitting her first career home run, one of three hits she had in the game.

The Greyhounds (19-5), who have received votes in the Division III top-25 poll, strung together five consecutive two-out hits to score seven runs in the top of the fifth, and Muhlenberg was shut down on offense the rest of the game.

In the second game, Moravian built a 4-0 lead heading into the bottom of the seventh and had on the mound Elizabeth Python, who had not allowed a run in 44 innings. The Mules broke that streak when a sacrifice fly by freshman Alyssa D’Addio brought in junior Michelle Consiglio, and Brewer’s two-run double made it a one-run game before the final out was recorded. 

Junior RiRi Ferrigno and sophomore Allie Saltstein had two hits apiece in the nightcap, and junior Samantha Crist singled twice and scored two runs in the opener.

The results tied the Matte Award standings at 7-7 with men’s and women’s track and field, men’s lacrosse and men’s golf yet to be played.

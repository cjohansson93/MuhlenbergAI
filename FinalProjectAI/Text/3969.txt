Seniors Ryan Wilson and Hannah Mitchell have run countless miles the last four years as members of the Muhlenberg cross country and track and field teams. But to get to  their last championship meet, they will just have to walk a few minutes.

Muhlenberg will host the Centennial Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championships for the

first time since 2005 this weekend. The meet starts with the decathlon, heptathlon and pole vault on Friday at 1:00. The 10,000-meter runs are scheduled for Friday evening, followed by a full slate of events Saturday and Sunday, culminating with the mens 4x400-meter relay on Sunday at 4:05.

Were really excited, said Wilson. Having the meet at home makes such a difference. I dont think people realize how much of a difference it is. You just feel so much more comfortable, and it makes running easier.

facilities right here, our families and friends can come watch us  its a lot of little things.

Little things can add up to a lot, especially in a track meet, where every point can impact a teams finish. The Mule men learned that at the CC Indoor Championships in February, when four teams were separated by 9.5 points in the race for second place behind nationally ranked Haverford. Muhlenberg came in third, three points behind Ursinus.

Thats such a small gap  it could be the difference between someone getting fourth and eighth in their event, said Wilson. As long as we cover our bases and pick up points here and there in all the events, theres no reason we cant get that second spot.

Muhlenberg has athletes in the top eight on the CC performance lists in all but three of the 21 events. Junior Peter Rice, who captured three golds and a silver en route to earning Most Outstanding Performer honors at the indoor meet, is seeded first in both the 200 and 400  events he won indoors.

The womens lone champion indoors was freshman Erin Saucier, who is tied for the top seed in the pole vault. Also seeded first is the 4x800 team, of which Mitchell is a part.

The women finished seventh at the CC Indoor Championships, but with a young team they hope to use that experience to better their standing.

Thats usually what our goal is, to improve on our indoor performance, said Mitchell. The outdoor championship is what we build to every year. Everyone learned from indoor conferences, and now everyones ready to go.

Weve had a lot of injuries, but I think weve been really resilient, and that has made us better competitors.

Both Muhlenberg teams have a history of competing very well at the CC meet, and the seniors on the teams would like nothing better than to end their careers on a high note at their home track.

Im feeling kind of bittersweet, said Mitchell. Im excited to have my last conference meet at home, but its sad. Knowing that its my last meet is very motivating.

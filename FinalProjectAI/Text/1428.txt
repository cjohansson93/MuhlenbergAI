Mapping the Plan: A Diversity Initiatives Gallery Walk
Introduction
On Wednesday, April 23, we invited the Muhlenberg College community to participate in a Gallery Walk to view the initiatives developed by the Diversity Strategic Planning Committee and by submssions from faculty, students, trustees and alumni.  If you were unable to attend the Gallery Walk, or if you did not have time to view all the initiatives, we now invite you to provide feedback on diversity initiatives. We’re in the process of deciding which ones will be moved forward to the research/costing-out stage.Click here to begin.

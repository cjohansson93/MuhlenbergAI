Community Update: July 21, 2020



A message from President Harring to the Muhlenberg College community

Tuesday, July 21, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community,
Planning for the fall semester is proceeding as we adapt to the evolving trends in the pandemic and gain additional guidance from our local public health experts and health care partners. We recognize that many students want to live and learn on campus and that others have concerns about a return to the College. As we finalize plans for the fall semester, the health and safety of all members of our community must be our priority.
The significant surges in the virus across the country are impacting testing availability, in particular access to rapid testing for asymptomatic individuals. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and are having ongoing discussions with our local health networks, the Allentown Health Bureau and Pennsylvania Department of Education. The information and guidance we receive informs our ongoing planning including:

evaluation of testing and quarantine protocols to adapt them to evolving conditions and
review of the options for the fall including the viability of our current plan. 

As you can imagine, there are multiple moving pieces and administrators are working diligently to bring the Collegeâs fall plans to fruition for our community. We have already modified some policies and decisions to adapt to new realities. As this is a continually evolving landscape, we realize new information or plans set by the College present a series of very complex decisions for students and families and may ultimately alter studentsâ decisions. We want to support our students in making the best decisions possible. As such, the Office of Housing and Residence Life will extend the deadline for residency confirmation until July 29. It should also be noted that students can make changes to their housing plans up until the semester begins and can modify course selections through the add/drop period this fall. Returning students can expect to receive their 2020-2021 financial aid awards next week. We support each student in making a choice that best suits their needs for the fall semester.
The updated course scheduleâpublished today and available when you log into Capstoneâincludes information about course times and whether the course will be taught in-person, as a hybrid of in-person and online instruction or completely online. Across course modalities, students should expect a high-quality academic experience. Our faculty have spent the summer working together and with the digital learning team in intensive workshops focused on teaching and learning across hybrid and online classes. All academic support will be available regardless of whether students are on campus or remote in the fall. To support remote access to courses, weâve upgraded technology and software.
As previously shared, the Fall semester will begin on August 24 and run through November 30. Final exams will be held December 4 through December 11. There will be no fall break. Classes for Winter term will run from January 4 through January 29. The Spring semester will begin on February 8. We will share the final 2020-21 academic year calendar very soon.
The College remains committed to ensuring a safe environment for the entire campus community. As we monitor the spread of the virus and the regional testing capacity, we will adapt our plans and provide updates to students, faculty and staff.
While the pandemic has caused considerable uncertainty in our lives, our Muhlenberg community is strong and committed to our shared goals and mission. During these difficult times, I am reminded of how deeply our community cares for one another. I am confident that together we will weather this storm through the resiliency of our students, faculty and staff. 
Sincerely,
Kathleen E. HarringPresident

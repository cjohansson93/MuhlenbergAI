softball eliminated from ncaa tourney





Ferrigno waits for the throw as a Farmingdale player scores on a sacrifice fly.


The Muhlenberg softball team was eliminated from the NCAA Division III Tournament with a pair of losses at Ramapo.

In the completion of Thursday’s suspended game, William Paterson scored four runs in the bottom of the sixth and went on to win, 9-2.

The Mules (19-18) took on Farmingdale State in their first elimination game and opened up a 1-0 lead in the top of the second when senior RiRi Ferrigno 
doubled, went to third on a sacrifice and scored on a sacrifice fly by fellow senior Samantha Crist.

Farmingdale (33-5) tied the score in the bottom of the inning, added another run in the third and put the game out of reach with two runs in the fifth.

Muhlenberg’s only other serious scoring threat came in the top of the fifth, but with two out and runners on the corners the Ram right fielder made
a diving catch of a liner by junior Jenna Van Waalwijk.

Ferrigno went 3-for-3 and tied a school record with her 36th career double in her last game for Muhlenberg.

Each college was selected based on the value added to students’ professional lives by attending as well as a range of other factors, including quality of education, affordability and post-graduate outcomes.
In the What Students are Saying section of the list, a current Muhlenberg student states, “In my opinion, Muhlenberg is the college that everyone needs to go to but doesn't realize it. The classes are small enough that the faculty can give active attention to each student. The faculty make a huge effort to get to know their students and to help them. Furthermore, everyone is really kind and considerate on campus, from the dining service faculty to all the students. It's not called ‘the caring college’ for nothing. It's a small school with a lot of spirit and there really is a place for everyone.”
Muhlenberg enrolls approximately 2,400 students, 86% of whom go on to graduate within four years. Alumni earn an average salary of $47,500 within the first five years following graduation. Acceptance rates are competitive at 46%. These factors helped to determine Muhlenberg’s placement on this list.    
Money’s College Planner used a percentage system based on 21 factors, each falling into one of three categories -- Quality of Education, Affordability and Outcomes -- to determine the constituents of this list. These categories are designed to determine the overall value afforded to post-graduate students by attending the school. According to College Planner’s analysis, Muhlenberg College is worth attending.
In addition to the top 50 liberal arts list, Muhlenberg College ranked #184 overall out of national universities and colleges.

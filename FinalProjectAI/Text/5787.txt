two mule teams in women’s tennis semis



The first Centennial Conference Invitational in women’s tennis will have two Muhlenberg teams among the four semifinalists.

The all-junior duo of Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld and the all-freshman duo of Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker are joined by teams from Washington and Bryn Mawr in
Saturday’s semis. Powell and Rotfeld received a first-round bye and won 8-3 in the quarterfinals. Druker and Sutker (left) won both of their matches easily; they are 3-0
this fall and have dropped only three games.

Powell and Druker received first-round byes in the singles draw, while Rotfeld captured her opening-round match in straight sets.

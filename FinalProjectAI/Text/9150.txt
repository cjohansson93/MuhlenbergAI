Background:
Dr. Melloâs areas of study include comparative politics, international relations, political theory, and the politics of social movements. Dr. Melloâs research focuses generally on politics in Europe and in the Middle East, and in particular on Turkish politics. Dr. Mello is currently working on a research project that applies insights from feminist IR theory to explore changing public support for US military intervention against the Islamic State. 
His past research examined such subjects as the impact of labor movement activism in Turkey, Great Britain, the United States and Japan; international norms of womenâs rights as human rights; the affect of civil-military relations on Islamic politics in Turkey; the causes and consequences of the Arab Spring; and ways to understand the symbolic meaning of Islamic State violence.
He has conducted extensive research in Turkey during the spring of 2004, interviewing union leaders in Istanbul, Ankara, and in the coal mining regions of the Black Sea coast, and then again during the summer of 2008, conducting archival research on the history of womenâs rights activism in Turkey at both the Parliamentary Library in Ankara and the Womenâs Library in Istanbul.
Together with Dr. Mark Stein, Dr. Mello has designed a Muhlenberg Integrated Learning Abroad (MILA) course that includes a two week travel experience in Turkey. 
In addition, Dr. Mello has taught a first-year seminar on HBOâs hit show, The Wire, and a first-year seminar on anarchism, that is loosely inspired by AMCâs hit show, The Walking Dead. 
Dr. Mello contributes to the Collegeâs focus on integrative learning through two sets of paired course, one that focuses on contemporary protest in the Middle East that is paired with a history course on revolutions in the Middle East, and another that focuses on radical Islamism as ideology and political praxis that is paired with a religion studies course on the religion of Islam.
Dr. Mello has worked with colleagues from Moravian College and Lafayette College to collaborate around issues of peace and conflict studies.  In addition, he has served as part of the program committee for the YWCA of Bethlehem hosted Great Decision in Foreign Affairs Program.

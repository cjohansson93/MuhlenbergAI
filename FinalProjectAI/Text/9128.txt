Muhlenberg College/Morning Call Pennsylvania 7th Congressional District Poll: September 2020

The 7th Congressional District was established in 2018 through a court ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania, and consists of all of Lehigh and Northampton Counties and the southern section of Monroe County. Had the district been formed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won the district by a single percentage point, making it one of the more competitive congressional districts in the Commonwealth.
Key Findings:

With Election Day 2020 about 5 weeks away, first term Democratic Congresswoman Susan Wild holds a 13-point lead (52%-39%) over Republican nominee Lisa Scheller in Pennsylvaniaâs 7th Congressional District.



Wildâs 13-point lead is slightly larger than her margin of victory in the 2018 midterm election when she beat Republican nominee Marty Nothstein by 10 points (54%-44%), and is driven by large leads among women, college educated voters, and voters living in Lehigh County.
In Pennsylvaniaâs 7th Congressional District, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a 7-point lead (51%-44%) over President Donald Trump among likely voters.  Looking back at 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 1% in the area that currently makes up the 7th District.



Like his fellow Democrat Susan Wild, Joe Bidenâs modest lead in the 7th District is driven by strong performances among voters living in Lehigh County, female voters and voters with a 4-year college degree.
The economy was identified by 27% of likely voters in the district as the most important issue in their decision in the congressional election, with the Coronavirus pandemic (17%), health care (16%), and law and order (15%) also commonly identified by voters as the key issue driving their vote in the race.
About 6 out of 10 (59%) likely voters in the 7th District report that they intend to vote in person this November, with about 1 in 3 intending to vote by mail (36%).
Among likely 7th District voters about 1 in 4 (27%) indicated, that as of the day they were surveyed, they did not feel safe voting in person.
Likely voters in the Pennsylvania 7th CD are divided on the threat of fraud associated with extensive mail-in voting this fall, with 51% agreeing that there is a greater chance of fraud if most Pennsylvanians vote by mail, and 44% disagreeing with this claim.
About 2 in 3 (64%) likely 7th District voters believe that Pennsylvania is prepared to keep the November election safe and secure.
A solid majority (60%) of likely 7th District voters agree that the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be chosen by the winner of the presidential election in November.



Nearly 2 in 3 (62%) of 7th District voters say President Trump has done either a poor or fair job handling the coronavirus outbreak.



PDF - Muhlenberg College/Morning Call Pennsylvania 7th Congressional District Poll - September 2020

Methodological Statement:The following report contains the results of a telephone survey of 414 likely voters in the 7th Congressional District in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, between September 21 and 24, 2020.  Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (104) and cell phones (310). With a randomly selected sample of respondents, the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence. Margins of error for questions with smaller sample size will be larger. In addition to sampling error, one should consider that question wording and other fielding issues can introduce error or bias into survey results. Interviewing was conducted by Communication Concepts of Easton, Pennsylvania under protocols established by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO.) The data has been weighted to gender, age, county, party, race and educational attainment to reflect voter population parameters in the district. The calculation of sampling error takes into account design effects due to the weighting identified above.  In order to reach a representative sample of registered voters both land lines and cell phones were called up to 3 times. The sampling frame for the study is from the registered voters files of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To determine likely voters, only voters who have voted in 1 or more of the last 4 general elections (2016-2019), or who is a new registrant since November of 2016 were included in the sampling frame. In addition, only survey respondents from this frame who indicated that they were âdefinitelyâ or âvery likelyâ to vote in the November election were included in the sample. Due to rounding the totals provided in the frequency report may not total 100%. The survey instrument (presented in its entirety below) was designed by Christopher P. Borick of the MCIPO in conjunction with the staff of the Morning Call. The survey was funded exclusively by the Morning Call and the MCIPO. For more detailed information on the methods employed, please call 484-664-3444 or email cborick@muhlenberg.edu.

Through the Red Doors of Trexler Library

Contact Us
Trexler Library is always available to our community. For reference or library instruction assistance, please contact our reference librarians at refdesk@muhlenberg.edu. All other inquiries can be directed to the Lending Services Desk at 484-664-3500 or circulationdesk@muhlenberg.edu. Trexler Library also posts updates and events on our social media accounts, so be sure to follow us to stay up-to-date.


In-Person & Virtual Services
Whether in the physical building or the comfort of their own home, Trexler Library is committed to ensuring that its patrons have access to all the information they need. During the Fall and Spring Semesters, the building is open 105 hours a week. The Hours page will always have a full listing of Library hours. The Library has three floors filled with nearly 500,000 books and journals and over 19,000 movies, CDs, and audiobooks. Even while off-campus, College community members can view countless eBooks and journal articles. Though the Library has an extensive collection, it is not possible to have every single item someone may need. Interlibrary Loan is an inclusive service where Muhlenberg community members have the ability to borrow materials worldwide. Physical books are shipped to the Library for one-location check out, while specific articles or chapters are sent via email. Whether here or there, Trexler Libraryâs services will always be available to you.
Personalized research assistance is also always available from our Reference Librarians. Each Librarian is responsible for particular academic subjects and is available in-person or virtually. Visit our Ask a Librarian page to see which subjects each Librarian specializes in and book an appointment with them.


Study Spaces
Trexler Library values the variety of study needs and generates different atmospheres to meet those needs. There are places in the library for noisy collaborative work and silent independent study. Workspaces range from study carrels to couches to bean bag chairs. The Library strives to make the building as welcoming as possible.


Library Technology
The Library is determined to have the technology that the Muhlenberg community would need for any task. There are computers and phone chargers available for checkout, cloud-based printers to allow printing from anywhere on campus with any device, a space to practice those nerve-wracking presentations, equipment to allow for seamless group collaboration, and so much more. Visit the Library Technology page to learn all about the devices and equipment Trexler Library has to offer.


Library Student Employment
Trexler Library is one of the many places on campus that has student worker positions. Here at the Library, there are nearly 50 positions available between Acquisitions and Government Documents, Lending Services, Administration, Serials, Cataloging, and Special Collections. Most of these employment opportunities are reserved for students who have âWork-Studyâ as part of their financial aid package. Interested in hearing more about the type of work you could do as a Trexler Library Student Worker? Contact our Administrative Assistant (484-664-3551) or visit our Student Employment page!


Library Events
While the Library acts as a valuable study space, it also hosts a variety of events to bring the Muhlenberg community together. Each semester, the Library puts on a themed Trivia Night to welcome all students, faculty, and staff to engage in friendly competition for glory and prizes. Health panels are also held in the Library to tackle relevant crises such as the Zika Virus, Opioid Addiction, and the Coronavirus from interdisciplinary points of view. Another annual event is the Trexler Library Book Sale, which typically occurs at the end of the Spring semester and offers used books, movies, and CDs at bargain prices. All Library events are publicized on our Facebook Page and Instagram accounts (@muhlenbergtrexlerlibrary, @bergspecialcollections), so make sure you follow us!

Muhlenberg Clinches Matte Award



Men’s Golf Third; Men’s Tennis Snaps Skid




Men’s Golf



Muhlenberg finished third in the Lehigh Valley Cup in its final competition before the Centennial Conference Championships.

The four local schools were separated by only nine strokes. The Mules actually tied Division I Lafayette in strokes, but due to an error one of the scorecards, they had to settle for being one stroke behind.

Senior Bill Snow led Muhlenberg with a 4-over-par 74, with junior Biff Slocum (76), senior Geoffrey Kelleman (77) and sophomore Zachary Oyer (79) also in the 70s.

Men’s Tennis



The Mules snapped a four-match losing skid with a 7-2 win at Ursinus. Freshmen Zach Adler and Jordan Rutt won at both doubles and singles, teaming up for their most decisive win (8-3) as a doubles team.

The weather changed more times than one side of the scoreboard did.

In conditions that ranged from sunny, to cloudy and windy, to raining, to sunny 



Junior Sean Delany dished out the first three assists of his career.



and raining at the same time, and back to just sunny, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team tuned up for a crucial regular-season finale by defeating Moravian, 14-2.

The win, combined with the men’s golf result against Moravian, clinched the Matte Award for 2008-09 for Muhlenberg, which has a 10½-6½ lead in the all-sports standings with one contest remaining.

The Mules (4-8) close out their regular season at home against Ursinus on Saturday, needing a win and some help to earn a Centennial Conference playoff berth. They will go into that contest on the heels of a game in which they won by a comfortable margin and gave many players time on the field.

Nine different players scored goals, led by junior Paul Munday with three, and two others added assists. Sophomore Zachary Armstrong and freshman Greg Flasser each scored the first two goals of their careers, and junior Matthew Schroeder netted the first of his career.

Muhlenberg kept the Greyhounds (4-11) off the scoreboard until 7:16 remaining in the fourth quarter, by which time the score was 14-0. It was the first time since men’s lacrosse was reinstated in 2003 that the Mules held an opponent scoreless in the first half, let alone the first three quarters.

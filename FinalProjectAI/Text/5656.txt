The Muhlenberg indoor track and field teams competed at Haverford’s Keogh Invitational in their final meet before the Centennial Conference Championships.

The Mules accomplished their goals of getting a handful of individuals qualified for the CC meet and having others improve their seed time.

Junior Stuart Udis (800 meters) and sophomore Alex Faust (pole vault) won their events. Udis clocked in at 1:56.21, more than a second better than his
previous best this season and four-tenths of a second off the NCAA provisional qualifying standard.

Sophomore Brendan Kirk set a personal record of 8.25 in the 55-meter hurdles, finishing second in the meet and moving into third place on Muhlenberg’s
all-time performance list. Junior Evan Shappard threw a personal-best 44-6¾ in the shot put to come in third, and senior Michael Karchner tied
his best of 12 feet in the pole vault.

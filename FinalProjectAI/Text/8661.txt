Teaching Interests:
I teach Spanish and Latin American literature and culture because I believe language learning is a way for my students to build bridges and make connections across cultures, both in the U.S. as well as abroad. I agree with Nelson Mandela who once wisely said âIf you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heartâ. Learning a second language can be a powerful tool in bringing humans together, and in teaching students to appreciate and respect diversity.
My language teaching pedagogy is not only based on the development of all four language skillsâlistening, reading, writing, and speakingâbut also integrates cultural knowledge. It is important for my students to know that a language does not exist in a vacuum, that they will not truly âknowâ a language unless they know the contexts in which it is spoken and the cultural practices of those who speak it. My goal in every class is for my students to see language learning as an asset to their future career and to their personal growth.
I believe in leveling the playing field in the language classroom so that students of all capacities and learning styles can succeed. For that reason, some of my most recent research has centered on exploring the best pedagogies for teaching students with physical, learning, and emotional challenges. Implementing the paradigm of Universal Design for Learning, developed by the Center for Applied Special Technology, is useful for instructing students with diverse learning styles and promotes equal access to learning. I believe that everyone can excel in the language classroom if given the right environment and tools.

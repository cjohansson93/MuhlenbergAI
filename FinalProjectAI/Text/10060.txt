We, the members of the Black Students Association (BSA) of Muhlenberg College, are here to promote diversity, encourage leadership and work for social justice. The BSA coordinates social activities and strengthens the bonds between students in the multicultural community, with an emphasis on African American students. The Black Students Association does not discriminate against race, creed, gender or sexuality and welcomes all Muhlenberg students to participate.

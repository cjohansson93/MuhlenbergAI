Rice named athlete of the week; womens tennis falls on the road


Junior Peter Rice of the Muhlenberg track and field team was named the Centennial Conference mens athlete of the week after breaking a pair of school records and posting an NCAA provisional qualifying time at Moravians Greyhound Invitational.

For the third meet in a row, Rice broke his own school record in the 400-meter dash when he crossed the line in 48.48 seconds. Rice, who competed in the 400 at the NCAA Indoor Championships, also passed the NCAA provisional qualifying standard of 48.50. His time currently ranks 10th on the Division III performance list.
 
Rice then went on to break the three-year-old metric school record in the 200-meter dash with a time of 22.10. 

Its the third time Rice has been named athlete of the week this season.

Not only did the lightning hold off in the sky, but it also did not strike a third time for the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team against Dickinson.

The Mules could not get their third win over a ranked team this season as the No. 6 Red Devils jumped out to a four-goal lead at the break and went on to win, 10-5.

Despite the loss, Muhlenberg (5-8, 2-5) could still finish in a tie for fourth, and final, playoff spot in the Centennial Conference.




Rispoli collected seven ground balls against Dickinson to set a new Mule single-season mark with 74 on the year.




The Mules are currently tied for seventh in the conference, but if they beat Ursinus on Saturday and both McDaniel and Franklin & Marshall fall to Gettysburg and Dickinson, respectively, there would be a four-way tie for fourth place. 

The fourth playoff spot would then be determined by a tiebreaker amongst the four teams  Muhlenberg, Ursinus, McDaniel and Franklin & Marshall.

On Wednesday, Dickinson (13-1, 7-0) struck first less than four minutes into the game, but then the two offenses quieted down.

Neither team could find the net for more than 20 minutes until the Devils scored three times in the final seven minutes of the half to take a 4-0 lead into the break.

Looking to provide a spark, sophomore Ian Jones won the opening faceoff of the second half, charged straight down the field and rattled the Devil cage to put the Mules on the board 20 seconds into the third quarter.

It was the first goal, and point, of Jones career, but Dickinson quickly responded with a 3-0 run to regain control. 

Muhlenberg appeared to be headed to the final quarter with some momentum on its side after freshman Tommy Glancy, sophomore Doug Rheiner and senior Zachary Armstrong scored back-to-back-to-back to pull the Mules to within three with three minutes to play in the third.

But the Red Devils struck with just 20 seconds remaining on the third-period clock and then added the first two goals of the fourth quarter to put the game away. The two teams finished with the same number of shots, but Dickinson held a plus-seven advantage in shots on goal and also won the turnover battle to help fend off the Mules.

Senior Mike Horowitz made 18 saves in the cage, while classmate Tom Brant picked up five ground balls and caused three turnovers for the Mules. Junior Nick Rispoli once again controlled the X, winning 11 of 13 faceoffs, and senior Brent Siebold added a goal to move into a tie for sixth place on the schools single-season goals list.

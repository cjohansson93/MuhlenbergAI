Women’s Tennis Edged by Swarthmore



After a year off, it looks like the Muhlenberg-Swarthmore women’s tennis rivalry is back.

The two schools alternated winning the Centennial Conference championship every year from 2001 to 2005. The last two of those years, a 5-4 victory by one against the other decided the CC crown.

The teams played another 5-4 contest in 2008, with Swarthmore winning to snap the Mules’ six-match winning streak. The Garnet came in ranked eighth in the Atlantic South Region, one spot ahead of Muhlenberg.

Freshmen Caitie Druker and Sara Sutker accounted for three of the Mules’ four points, teaming up for a doubles win and winning their singles matches.

Muhlenberg (7-3, 6-2) can still clinch a CC playoff spot by defeating Franklin & Marshall at home on Wednesday.

line in 31:23.74, taking nearly a minute off the school record of 32:17.46 set in 2001. He also easily passed the ECAC-qualifying mark
of 33:00.24, one of four ECAC-qualifying efforts by the Mules.

Senior Michael Karchner qualified for ECACs while placing eighth with a score of 5515 in the decathlon, and sophomore Brendan Kirk scored a sixth-place 
finish and ECAC time (55.91) in the 400 hurdles. Top-10 places were hard to come by in a meet with so many Division I and Division II athletes.

Junior David Chorney in the 1,500 meters was Muhlenberg’s fourth ECAC qualifier, clocking in at 3:58.80

On the women’s side, sophomore Lauren Conicella and freshman Abby Simons pulled off an impressive double by posting good times in the 1,500 meters
Friday night, then coming back to run well in the 800 meters on Saturday.

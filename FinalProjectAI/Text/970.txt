About the Shankweiler Scholars Program
John Shankweiler '21 was a renowned and beloved biology professor, remembered for his untiring advancement of the sciences and excellent teaching during his service from 1921 to 1964. He founded the Pre-Medical Society in 1931 and was known for going the extra mileâstaying late in the lab to assist students who needed extra help and even personally driving students to medical school interviews.
Faculty and staff like Dr. Shankweiler continue this effort across the sciences, humanities and arts. Muhlenberg students receive personalized support and curricular advice to tailor their own experience, ensuring that a student in any academic program receives the guidance needed to prepare them for the rigors of medical school and a career in the health professions.

The Shankweiler Society is named in honor of Dr. John Shankweiler '21, pictured here (right) with Dr. John Trainer.
Students meeting high academic criteria and who indicate an interest in pursuing an MD degree after graduation on their Common Application will be considered for the Shankweiler Scholars Program. While there is no additional application or essay required, if students feel there is additional information that the Shankweiler selection committee should know about their experiences or interests in the program, students may submit a statement to Dr. Casey James Miller. 
Muhlenberg students accepted into the Shankweiler Scholars program will:

Enroll in three dedicated 0.5-course scholarsâ seminars, taken in the first, sophomore, and senior years, which focus on medicine as a human endeavor.
Participate in planning and attend public lectures focused on the theme of medicine and society.
Complete a curriculum, designed in collaboration with a Shankweiler Scholars advisor, which draws from a variety of academic disciplines. The emphasis of this curriculum, inspired by strong and widespread input from leading U.S. medical schools, is an exploration of medicine as a human practice informed by study in humanities and social sciences.
Complete all graduation requirements and core pre-medical courses.
Achieve a minimum 3.0 cumulative G.P.A. at the end of their first academic year and a minimum 3.3 cumulative G.P.A. at the end of all subsequent years.
Receive an annual merit award (currently $5,000 per year) for scholars who meet ongoing program requirements.

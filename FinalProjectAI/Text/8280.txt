Muhlenberg College dancers tell their stories through movement, as the Muhlenberg theatre & dance department presents "Dance Emerge," a showcase for dance works created by emerging choreographers, April 16-18 in the College's Baker Theatre. Jeffrey Peterson is the artistic director for the concert.
"Choreographers in this year's 'Dance Emerge' are honoring their own unique voices as they create personal dances which celebrate the joys of life and unearth the depths of their souls," Peterson says. "The journey for the audience will undoubtedly juxtapose the human experience with quirky character-driven studies and more intimate work - all blending physical skill with choreographic imagination."
"Dance Emerge" will showcase 12 choreographers and 60 dancers from the department's dance program, which is among the most highly regarded programs of its kind. The concert features costume and lighting designs by the department's acclaimed professional staff.
The 12 original dances include contemporary jazz, dance theater, and modern works that investigate such topics as platonic love, the grieving process and the individual vs. the whole. Choreographers drew inspiration from such diverse sources as dance history, travel, personal relationships and college experiences.
Muhlenberg College's Theatre & Dance Department offers one of the top-rated college performance programs in the county, according to the Princeton Review rankings. Muhlenberg is a liberal arts college of more than 2,200 students in Allentown, Pa., offering Bachelor of Arts degrees in theater and dance. It has been named annually among The Fiske Guide to Colleges' top 20 small college programs in the United States, and the American College Dance Festival Association has consistently recognized dances premiered on the Muhlenberg stage for excellence in choreography and performance.
"Dance Emerge" runs April 16-18 in the Baker Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance, Muhlenberg College, 2400 Chew St., Allentown.
Performances are April 16-18: Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday, April 12, at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults, $8 for patrons 17 and under, and $8 for students, faculty and staff of all LVAIC colleges. Tickets and information are available at 484-664-3333 or muhlenberg.edu/dance.

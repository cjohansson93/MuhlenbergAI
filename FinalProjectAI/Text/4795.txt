Mules Fall at Lehigh


The Muhlenberg baseball team brought its best hitter to the plate as the tying run in the ninth inning but ultimately fell to Division I Lehigh, 7-4.

The Mules (16-19) entered the ninth trailing by six but mounted a comeback thanks to a slew of walks and passed balls. With two outs and a man on, junior Jeff Puklin ripped a single through the right side. The next two batters walked, and junior Clint Lynch scored on a passed ball.

Senior Eric Pomroy then drew another walk - Muhlenberg's fourth of the inning and third straight - to bring up junior Joseph DiCecilia with the bases loaded and a chance to tie with one swing of the bat.

The Mountain Hawks (19-24) brought in their closer, and after another passed ball brought home a run he induced a groundout to shortstop to end the game.

Six of Lehigh's seven runs scored in the second on the strength of four walks and three run-scoring hits. After that five Mule pitchers combined to allow just one unearned run on seven hits.

Puklin and Lynch both went 2-for-3 with a walk at the plate. Junior Jason Daniels pitched two no-hit innings in the third and fourth.

Junior Joseph DiCecilia of the Muhlenberg baseball team was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team at designated hitter.



DiCecilia (left) has put together one of the best offensive seasons in Muhlenberg history. Entering today's action, he led the Mules with a .454 batting average, nine home runs and 43 RBI. He scored 34 runs and stole seven bases, both second on the team, and had a 1.269 OPS.

DiCecilia entered the week second in the CC in hits (59), third in batting average, fourth in home runs and slugging (.769) and fifth in RBI.

He has already broken the school record for hits in a season and is two homers shy of tying the single-season record. Earlier in the year he put together the second longest hitting streak in Muhlenberg history - 16 games, just one shy of the record - and posted the program's first recorded cycle since 1954.

Senior Dan Fisher received All-CC honorable mention. Fisher is hitting .430 from the shortstop position and leads the Mules in runs scored (47), doubles (15, also tops in the CC) and stolen bases (13). Fisher's 15 doubles broke the school record for two-baggers in a season, and he is just two runs shy of the school record for a single season. He owns the career record in both categories.

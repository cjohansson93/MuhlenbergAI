RESISTING AGGRESSION WITH DEFENSE:
(RAD for Men)
The RAD for Men program offers participants an opportunity to raise their awareness of aggressive behavior, recognize how aggressive behavior impacts their lives, learn steps to avoid aggressive behavior, consider how they can be part of reducing aggression and violence, and practice hands-on self-defense skills to resist and escape aggressive behavior directed toward them. The program is designed to empower participants to make safer choices when confronted with aggressive behavior.

Senior Research Symposium 


Held in the spring of each academic year, the Senior Research Symposium features presentations by graduating seniors, including talks and posters, on research emerging out of honors thesis projects and capstone seminars in sociology and anthropology. As part of the culminating undergraduate experience in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, the Senior Research Symposium gives students and their friends, families and instructors an opportunity to gather and celebrate the accomplishments of our sociology and anthropology majors and minors.

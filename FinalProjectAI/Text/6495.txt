Men's Soccer Rains Shots, Shuts Out Hopkins
 Saturday, September 22, 2012 - page 3







					 



The skies opened up just as the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team jogged onto the field for warmups before its game against Centennial Conference rival Johns Hopkins. Somewhat miraculously, the rain ceased just in time for the starting whistle. For the Johns Hopkins goalie, however, the “rain” did not end when the clouds parted.

In their 2-0 shutout of Johns Hopkins, the Mules rained 15 of their total 25 shots on the Blue Jays’ goal.




Way's goal was the 24th of his career.



The first ball to find the back of the net came in the 36th minute when senior Danny Way headed the ball across the goal and just inside the right post. It was Way’s second goal of the season, made possible by a well-placed cross from junior Chris Royer.

Raindrops began to fall again just as the first half concluded, progressing into a steady downpour by the start of the second half.

“I love the rain. It makes the game faster, harder and dirtier, which is a lot of fun,” said muddy and rain-soaked senior co-captain Kyle Plifka.

The slippery playing conditions didn’t do much to hinder the performance of senior Cody Antonini. He reeled off 13 high-velocity shots throughout the game, including the Mules’ second goal in the 62nd minute of play. In typical highlight-reel fashion, Antonini blew by his defenders and blasted a shot into the back of the goal from a tough angle for his team-high sixth goal of the season. He is now tied for seventh on Muhlenberg’s all-time list with 90 points in his career.

The solid Mule defense prevented the Blue Jays from taking a shot on goal in the first half, and gave up just two shots on goal in the second half. Johns Hopkins only took three corner kicks during the game, another credit to the Muhlenberg defense.

Junior goalie Jas Chojnowski played all 90 minutes in recording the Mules’ fourth shutout in five games. Muhlenberg has not allowed a goal in over 353 minutes.

“We brought back the whole back line from last season and we have a strong goalie,” said Plifka in reference to this outstanding figure.

The Mules’ first victory over Johns Hopkins since 2005 brings them to 5-1 overall and 2-0 in the CC, giving them sole possession of first place in the conference standings following a 1-1 tie by Dickinson and Swarthmore.

“It definitely puts a target on our back because everyone is going to want to beat us,” said Plifka. “But ultimately it just fuels our fire and gets us pumped.”

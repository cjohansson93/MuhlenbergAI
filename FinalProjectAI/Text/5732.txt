During his tenure, he led his team in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and field-goal percentage for three straight years. He is the only Mule to average 20 points per game in a season since 1971, pouring in 20.2 points a game as a junior.

Dean Lowe was a three-sport athlete during his days at ‘Berg. A three-year letterwinner as a football halfback, Lowe was the co-captain of the 1963 team.

On the basketball court, Lowe was a two-year letterwinner as the forward, averaging 7.6 points per game.   

Captain of the 1964 team and a three-year letterwinner in track, Lowe was the 1964 Middle Atlantic Conference champion in the 120-yard hurdles and the 1963 MAC runner-up in 120 hurdles and 220 hurdles. He set school records in both hurdle events and was the track team’s high scorer in his junior and senior seasons.

team as a senior and set school records for blocked kicks in a season (6) and career (10). His career totals included 165 tackles and 6 interceptions. 

The 1995 men’s soccer team, under the guidance of Jeff Tipping, advanced to the semifinals of the NCAA Division III Tournament and tied for third place, the best finish ever by a Muhlenberg team at an NCAA event. They played eventual national champion Williams to a 1-1 tie in the semifinals before getting eliminated on penalty kicks. The Mules finished with a record of 16-1-4 and outscored their opponents 60-16. The team won the Centennial Conference championship and ranked as high as third in Division III during the regular season.

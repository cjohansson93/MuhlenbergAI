Writing Associates
Writing associates are writing tutors who are assigned to work with an upper-level writing-intensive class. Associates work directly with a professor. Associates do not attend all classes, but rather work closely with the professor in developing out-of-class writing workshops, individual tutorials, and group tutorials.

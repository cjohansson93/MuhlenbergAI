Innovative, contemporary printmaking by east-coast artists is at the heart of 4 x 4.  Artists Gary Kachadourian, Rob Swainston, Eva Wylie, and the art collective Space 1026 are working well outside the box of traditional and historical printmaking. 
Although Swainston works with traditional processes, he foregoes the frame and his prints spill off the wall and become monumental structures.  In her site specific installations, Wylie screen prints directly onto the wall and adds layers of collage to create a final effect that meanders seductively across the viewing plane.  Kachadourian’s life-size prints have been described as simultaneously delicate and monumental, mundane and outrageous.  The Philadelphia-based art collective, Space 1026, will add their trade-mark energy and more unexpected elements to the semester’s final, site-specific exhibit.
A reception for the artists will be held Wednesday, Nov.  17, 4:30 – 6 p.m. in the Martin Art Gallery.  The exhibition and reception are free and open to the public.  The Martin Gallery is located in the Baker Center for the Arts, Muhlenberg College, Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Gallery hours are: Tuesday through Saturdays, noon – 8 p.m.; closed during major holidays and semester breaks.  Information: 484.664.3467.

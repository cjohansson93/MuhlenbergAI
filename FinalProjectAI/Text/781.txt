The Future of News is Black and White: Why Online News Will Never Fully Replace Newspapers
The newsroom has become a site of job instability and uncertainty, asrevenues and circulation have steadily decreased. Some blame theinternetâs rising popularity for the newspaperâs demise. Many considerprint newspapers and online publications to be at war with one another,noting how newspapers are struggling while their own Web sites offerfree and updated information. But is it possible for internet news andprint news to coexist? This paper explores the relationship betweenprint news and online news, and concludes that they are too different todirectly compete. One news source will not be able to hold a monop-oly, simply because each source requires different writing and readingstyles. The internet lends itself to âscannability,â as readers can glanceover bold headlines and click through Web pages to gain a generalsense of the news. Newspaper readers, on the other hand, value rou-tine and settling down with a paper in their hands. Print newspapershave always been considered a staple in American society, and their in-depth, investigative reporting would be difficult to replace with onlinepublications. Print newspapers and the internet both provide relevantinformation, and because they differ so much in layout and writingstyle, it is conceivable that both can thrive, and possibly even benefitfrom one another.

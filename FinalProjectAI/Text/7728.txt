Record, Milestone for 2-0 Volleyball; Women's Soccer Starts with Win

The Muhlenberg volleyball team came out for the new season swinging, setting a school record for highest hitting percentage in a three-set match in a sweep of Alfred.

The Mules completed a perfect 2-0 day at Gettysburg’s Battlefield Classic with an impressive 3-1 win against Salve Regina, a 26-win team and ECAC semifinalist last year. Junior Vanessa Pulice recorded the 1,000th assist of her career in the second match.


Muhlenberg dominated from the beginning in the Alfred match, breezing 25-7, 25-15, 25-9. Thanks to the sharp passing of Pulice (13 assists) and senior Nikki Dickson (15), the Mules committed only five attack errors in the three sets for a .524 hitting percentage. That broke the record of .520 set against Rust last year.



Senior Holly Hynson made a triumphant return from an injury that curtailed her 2013 season, banging down seven kills in only 11 attempts without an error. Juniors Erin Murphy (7 kills in 12 attempts) and Sarah Weyhmuller (7 kills in 10 attempts) also hit efficiently.

Pulice (right) finished the match with 999 career assists and became the ninth Mule to reach 1,000 early against Salve Regina. That was the only thing decided early, as the teams battled through three close sets before Muhlenberg finally prevailed.

Junior Katherine Boll recorded nine kills in 20 attempts without an error and added four blocks. Dickson had 19 assists and nine digs and notched kills on all three of her attempts.

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team opened the season with a 1-0 home win against Wilkes. The lone goal came with 16:24 left in the first half when a corner kick by senior Krissy Fioretti squirted through the hands of the Wilkes goalie and crossed over the goal line. It was the second career goal for Fioretti.

The defense took care of the rest in a game that featured only 13 total shots. Junior Jen Mermelstein (left) made three saves, including one at close range midway through the first half, in recording her second career shutout.

oyer ties for second;men’s golf sixth in cc preview


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished sixth out of 15 teams at its first tournament of the spring, the McDaniel Spring Invitational.

The two-day tournament was a preview for the Centennial Conference Championships, which are scheduled to be contested in a month. All seven CC
schools that sponsor men’s golf were present; in fact, if the entire CC tournament cannot be played due to weather, the results from McDaniel
will count to determine the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Championships.

Swarthmore finished the highest of the CC teams, coming in second overall. The Mules, competing without two of their top three players from the fall
season, were third among CC schools, although Franklin & Marshall had two players disqualified in the second round and did not have a complete team
score.

Muhlenberg showed the greatest improvement from the first round to the second, lowering its score by 19 strokes to move up from 13th to sixth.

Senior Zachary Oyer (right) tied for the lowest score with two other golfers with a 36-hole total of 150, shooting a 3-over-par 75 in each round. 
He lost the tiebreaker for medalist on a match of cards. Oyer has tied for second in his last three tournaments.

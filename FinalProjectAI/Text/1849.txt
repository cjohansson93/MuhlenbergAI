Special Housing Request Process 
Students with a diagnosed medical condition which may significantly impact residential living may submit a Special Housing Request through the Office of Disability Services. The accommodations requested through this process must be an integral component of a treatment plan prescribed by a medical professional qualified to treat that particular condition. Students are encouraged to review all facets of the documentation process including the bulleted items listed on the Special Housing Request Student Form and the Diagnostician Report Guidelines.
The Special Housing Request Committee is comprised of representatives from the Office of Disability Services, Office of Residential Services, Counseling Services, and Student Health Services. The Committee considers and prioritizes applications case-per-case based on how the severity of the medical condition may significantly impact residential living.
Please note:
*Documentation of a condition does not guarantee that an application will be approved.  
In order to initiate the process, students should complete the Special Housing Request Student Form available on the Office of Disability Services and Residential Services web pages. The Diagnostician Report Guidelines should be presented to the medical professional who will provide written documentation of the condition. Interviews are scheduled after receipt of documentation and forms.
Continuing Muhlenberg College students must submit the Special Housing Request Student Form with the supporting documentation and complete the personal interview.
Incoming first year students must submit the Special Housing Request Student Form with the supporting documentation, and complete the personal interview. 
Transfer students must submit the Special Housing Request Student Form along with the supporting documentation and complete the personal interview no later than two weeks before the start of the semester for which they are admitted to Muhlenberg.
*Please refer to the respective document below for special housing request due dates.
For further information contact the Office of Disability Services at 484-664-3825.

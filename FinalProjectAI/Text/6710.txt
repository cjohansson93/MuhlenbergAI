Men's Basketball Rallies But Falls on Late FTs
 Saturday, December 8, 2012 - page 2







					 


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team went into last Saturday facing a stretch of three conference road games in eight days at schools that have been hard places at which to pick up wins. The Mules won the first two games, and they nearly pulled out the third.




Killing scored Muhlenberg's last eight points of the first half. He finished the game with a career-high seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.




Johns Hopkins hit two free throws with 6.3 seconds remaining to survive a furious Muhlenberg rally and win, 76-74.

The Mules (5-3, 3-2), who had their four-game winning streak snapped, closed out the first half on a 12-0 run to take a 38-29 lead into the locker room. But Hopkins (5-3, 3-2) inched back into the game in the second half, eventually tying it at 56 on a three-pointer with 9:18 left.

The Blue Jays maintained their momentum and appeared to have the game in hand when they took their biggest lead at 72-63 with three minutes to play. However, a free throw by freshman Alec Stavetski, a jumper by junior Austin Curry and a three by sophomore Malique Killing, combined with two defensive stops, brought Muhlenberg to within three at 72-69 with 1:09 remaining.

A pair of Hopkins free throws stretched the lead to 74-69 with 32.8 seconds left. On the next possession, Killing was fouled while shooting a three. He made the first two free throws and missed the third, but Stavetski grabbed the offensive rebound and kicked it to Curry, who drained a three from the wing to tie the game at 74 with 22.2 seconds on the clock.

A Blue Jay player drew a foul on a drive to the basket on the next possession and made both free throws. Killing, who hit the game-winning three-pointer in Wednesday’s win at Dickinson, got a good look at a three at the final buzzer, but his shot drew iron and bounced away.

Killing finished with 30 points for the third 30-point game of his career – his second this season. Curry added a season-high 20 on the strength of 4-of-5 shooting from behind the arc, and junior Kevin Hargrove neared a double-double with 12 points and nine rebounds to go along with four blocks.

Stavetski added a career-high 10 rebounds to his eight points.

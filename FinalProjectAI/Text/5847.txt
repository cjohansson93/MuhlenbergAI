Two teams work overtime for cc wins




Field Hockey Doubles Up Washington


The Muhlenberg field hockey team began Centennial Conference regular-season play in 2007 the same way it ended it in 2006: with a win at Washington.

This one took a little longer to come by than last year’s 3-1 victory. Senior Lauren Rutt scored her second goal in as many games 3:58 into the second overtime
to send the Mules (4-2) home happy.

Muhlenberg held a slight 18-17 advantage in shots through regulation and the first overtime, but came out firing in the second extra period, taking six shots. The first
five were saved before Rutt shot home a rebound for the game-winning goal.

Senior Jillian Duffy scored the Mules’s first goal late in the first half, negating an early Shorewomen goal. Washington was awarded a penalty corner as time expired
in regulation, but Muhlenberg cleared the ball to send the game into overtime.

Freshman Rachael Goldstein navigates through the McDaniel defense.



Forward Kasey Hacker scored two goals to rally the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team from an early deficit to defeat McDaniel, 2-1 in overtime, in the Centennial Conference opener for both schools. 

“In the break before overtime, we decided that we needed to bury one early,” the sophomore Hacker said. “And that’s what we did. We finished up strong.” 

In the fourth minute of overtime, Ashley O’Grady dribbled within yards of the endline, just inside McDaniel’s penalty box. She hit a centering pass that the Green Terror’s keeper was unable to control and Hacker fought off a defender to nudge the ball across the goal line. 

“Coach always tells us, ‘Get on the back post, frame the goal,’” said Hacker. “I knew I had to be there.”  

The Green Terror (0-6, 0-1 CC) gave the game a jolt of electricity early as the visitors scored on a counter attack in the fourth minute of the game. 

Muhlenberg (3-1-2, 1-0 CC) controlled most of the game, outshooting McDaniel 28-6 and holding a 6-1 edge in corner kicks. While nearly all the action was happening in McDaniel’s half of the field, the Mules were unable to convert their chances. 

Muhlenberg capitalized on its possession advantage to even the score in the 69th minute, when a loose ball fell to Hacker 20 yards from goal. She turned and lobbed a shot that perfectly found the top corner of goal and eluded the leaping McDaniel goalkeeper. 

Following the goal, the Green Terror made several pushes forward and threatened to score in the final minute of regulation, but Mule goalie Kate Morrissey produced a nice save to force overtime.

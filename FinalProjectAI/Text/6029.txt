Women's Soccer Blanks Owls For Third Straight Shutout

Men's Soccer Streaks Snapped



Two early headers snapped the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s unscored-upon streak at 296 minutes as the Mules fell at Drew, 3-0.

The loss brought an end to some other impressive defensive streaks as well. It was the Mules’ first loss by three goals since 2005 (the last time they won the CC title); they hadn’t lost a game by more than one goal since early in the 2008 season.

It was also the first time Muhlenberg surrendered more than two goals since the 2008 opener.

DeAngelis Sets Mark in Field Hockey Loss


On a night when the Muhlenberg field hockey team fell to King’s, 5-1, senior Brittany DeAngelis added her named to the school record book.

She swept away a Monarch shot in the sixth minute for her 17th career defensive save, which broke the school record.

Junior Devon Barber scored the Mules’ lone goal when she made a diving strike at a deflection in front of the cage in the 48th minute.

It’s said that all good things come in threes, and Michele Toher of the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team may have proved that theory correct Wednesday afternoon.

The senior goalie recorded her third consecutive shutout and ran her unscored-upon streak to 290 minutes as the Mules blanked Bryn Mawr, 3-0.


While Toher and the rest of the defense, which only allowed two shots on goal, were keeping the Owls at bay, the Mule offense got to work quickly.

Freshman Colleen Touhey controlled a bad clear and lofted it over the keeper’s head for her first career goal to give Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute.
 
Five minutes later, senior Meghan O’Grady (left) scored off a pass from junior Alyssa Meola to stretch the advantage to 2-0.

The goal was the 25th of O’Grady’s career; she is one of just nine Muhlenberg players to reach that milestone.

A little more than a minute into the second half, the Mules struck for the final time when Meola scored on a header off a corner kick from sophomore Stephanie Tramutola. It was her third goal of the season, which ties her with O’Grady for second on the team.

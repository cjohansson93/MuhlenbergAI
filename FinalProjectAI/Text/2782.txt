men’s basketball closes with win




A big thank you to Liddic for dis-“Spence”-ing these reports back home.



The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team just finished up a nine-day trip to Ireland. Here is the last of sophomore Spencer Liddic’s 
reports:

Wednesday, August 26
A great ending to a great trip as the Mules pulled out their final win to finish with a 3-1 record. 

The Mules beat “Star of the Sea,” 82-52. After 


only leading by nine at half, the Mules opened up the third quarter with a 37-6 run to open 
the game wide open. Muhlenberg had a balanced scoring attack with every player scoring. We outrebounded the Belfast team, 37-22,
with Ryan Foster leading the way with eight rebounds and Spencer Liddic 


and Peter Barnes chipping in with seven apiece. 
Leading the balanced attack with 15 points was Liddic, followed by Evan Tozer with 13, Barnes with 10, Brian Frankoski with nine and
Foster with eight. 

This shows that every player on this team can and will be a contributing player.

We are excited for the arrival of the incoming freshmen to see the skill set they can bring to help us as we strive to become the best team we can be. 
Every player left tonight excited to get the season started after we saw how great this team can be when we play together as one. 
One more night together here in Belfast to enjoy, then we board the plane heading back to Newark at 11:30 and land at 1:45 in the afternoon on Thursday. 

This has been such a positive experience by not only giving us the opportunity to play basketball in Ireland together, but for us to spend time and 
mature together with each other and the new coaches. We look forward to getting back and seeing you all!

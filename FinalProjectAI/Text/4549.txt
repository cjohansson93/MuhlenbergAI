against Juniata. After the Eagles took a 3-0 lead with a field goal late in the first quarter, Nadell brought the ensuing kickoff back, starting a run of 38 unanswered points by Muhlenberg.

Nadell also returned an interception for a touchdown, but the score was called back due to a penalty.

The touchdown was the second for Nadell; he also returned a kickoff for a touchdown against Union last year. The Mules have now returned 10 kickoffs for TDs in the last 11 years, and Nadell is the sixth player in program history with more than one touchdown on kickoff returns.

For the season, Nadell is averaging 38.1 yards per return.

Although sophomore running back Terrence Dandridge (right) wasnt named offensive player of the week, he accomplished a rarity when he rushed for 104 yards on only nine carries.

Dandridge is only the third Mule in the last 25 years, and only the ninth on record all-time, to gain 100 yards on fewer than 10 carries. Interestingly, the last two to achieve the feat, John DeLuca and Justin Jones, went on to earn CC player-of-the-year honors in future years.

Dandridge is second in the CC in rushing at 83.4 yards per game and is averaging 6.0 yards per carry. He is the first Muhlenberg sophomore to record three consecutive 100-yard games since all-time leading rusher Matt Bernardo in 2001.

Sahar Sadeghi, Ph.D. 
Assistant Professor of Sociologyâ
Background:
B.A. Sociology, University of California-Davis, 2005M.A. Sociology, Temple University, 2008PH.D. Sociology, Temple University, 2014
Sahar Sadeghi is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Muhlenberg College, and teaches a variety of courses including the Sociology of Inequality and Power, American Ethnic Diversity, Transnational Migrant Communities, Global Perspectives on Race and Racism, as well as Sociological Theory.  Dr. Sadeghi is also a faculty mentor for a number of students working on their undergraduate research projects.
Professor Sadeghi earned her Ph.D. in 2014 from Department of Sociology at Temple University.  Her research is organized around several interrelated projects and themes â migration and geopolitics, as well as racialized and politicized belonging â which are examined through a cross-national, qualitative methods approach with a regional specialization in contemporary Europe and the United States.  In her most recent work, Sadeghi considers how the rise of anti-immigrant movements across Europe, the 2015 Refugee Crisis, and the 2016 Iran Deal are reflected in the perceptions and experiences of belonging and membership of Iranians in the US and Germany.

oyer! oyer! oyer!men’s golf reigns supreme


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team took home all the top honors at the Messiah College Falcon Classic.

The Mules won the team title by eight strokes over Messiah with a score of 314. (corrected 10/4) Junior Zachary Oyer took medalist honors by two strokes by shooting 
a 2-over-par 74 at Blue Ridge Country Club in Harrisburg.

The tournament championship was the first for Muhlenberg since it captured the Susquehanna Invitational in April 2008. In the fall of that school year, the Mules
won the Messiah Falcon Classic; in their three appearances at Messiah they have finished first twice and second once.

Oyer (left) finished atop the leaderboard for the first time in his career; he had three previous second-place finishes.
In four rounds this fall, Oyer has shot three 74s and a 73.

Freshman Brandon Davis tied for third with a 77. Only nine of the 83 golfers who teed off shot in the 70s. Junior Jordan Carpenter (81) and
senior Biff Slocum (82) also contributed to the Mules’s winning score.

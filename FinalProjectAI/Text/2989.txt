MEN’S SOCCER RALLIES FOR WIN


When senior Mike Gehrmann scored for the Muhlenberg men's soccer team with 15:00 to play against Johns Hopkins on Saturday, it looked like he had netted the game winner. But Hopkins rallied to spoil Gehrmann's heroics.

 The Mules made sure the same couldn't be said on Wednesday.




Daniels made a career-high six  saves in the victory.




Gehrmann scored with 3:37 remaining to lift Muhlenberg (7-3) to a thrilling 2-1 come-from-behind victory over regional rival DeSales (8-3). The midfielder won a loose ball in the Bulldogs' box and placed it into the top right corner to give the Mules the win.

"I got a little worried sitting on the bench at the end," said Gehrmann. "I didn't want the same thing to happen again."

The Mule defense ensured it wouldn't. The back four clamped down 


 Field Hockey Falls Prey to Bears




Muhlenberg became the latest in a long line of victims of the fourth-ranked Ursinus field hockey team, falling 6-1.

Since suffering a 2-0 loss to Salisbury, the Bears (10-2, 4-0) have won seven in a row, outscoring their opponents 52-3. Two of those wins were against
nationally ranked opponents, 9-1 against New Jersey and 7-0 vs. Gettysburg.

Despite getting outshot 44-8, the Mules (6-4, 2-2) kept the score at 4-1 for most of the second half until Ursinus put in two goals in the final 10:07.

Freshman Kristen Dornenburg made 20 saves, only the second 20-save game by a Muhlenberg goalie since 1997, and was helped out by sophomore
Brittany DeAngelis, who notched a pair of defensive saves.

Senior Nicki Notarianni scored the lone goal for the Mules to move into sixth on the program’s all-time points list with 65.

in the second half, allowing DeSales just one shot the entire period. The Mules outshot the Bulldogs 9-1 in the second half and 22-10 for the game.

The first half was a bit more even, with both sides firing at the keepers. The Mules had several excellent chances, including an indirect free kick inside the box after sophomore Cody Antonini was dragged down trying to play a loose ball, but could not find the back of the net.

DeSales also had its fair share of chances. Junior goalie Jason Daniels made an outstanding save in the 30th minute, coming out against a charging forward on a long run, but could not keep the Bulldogs off the board when they converted a penalty kick just a few minutes later.

Muhlenberg fought back in the second half, eventually tying the score with 12:28 to play when senior Eric Miller sent a cross from the right that was headed in by junior Tom Reilly. Miller has assisted on all three of Reilly's goals this season.

Nine minutes later Gehrmann put in the go-ahead goal, his fourth of the year, to complete the comeback.

"This was a huge regional game, and we knew we had to pull out a win," he said. "We fought hard and grinded it out. Good teams always find a way to win."

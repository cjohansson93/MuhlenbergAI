team at Washington.

After opening up a double-digit halftime 
lead, the Mules had to weather a pair of Shoremen runs to hang on for their third straight win, 77-71.

The victory was only the fourth in 17 games at Chestertown for Muhlenberg, and it was a blowout compared to the first three: overtime wins in 1994 and 2004 and a one-point squeaker in 2002.

Ahead 27-24 with 6:30 left in the first half, the Mules (4-3, 3-1) held Washington without a field goal the rest of the half and went into the locker room with a 40-30 lead.

Five straight points by sophomore Ryan Foster gave Muhlenberg a 13-point edge early in the second half. The bulge was 12 before the Shoremen (2-6, 0-4) went on an 11-0 run to draw within one, 47-46, with 13 minutes left. The Mules responded with an 11-2 run, regaining their double-digit margin.

Again Washington came back, using a 10-2 run to turn a 68-58 deficit into a 70-68 game with 2:39 left to play. Back-to-back jumpers by juniors Darrell Roth and Mike Bernardini, sandwiched around an offensive foul, enabled Muhlenberg to hang on.

Sophomore Brian Frankoski led the Mules with 15 points on perfect shooting, 5-of-5 from the field and 5-of-5 from the line. He also pulled down eight rebounds. Roth (12 points) and senior Greg Pask (11) also scored in double figures off the bench, as Muhlenberg’s reserves were responsible for 44 of the team’s 77 points. 

The Mules, off to a 3-1 start in the Centennial Conference for the second straight year, have a month off from CC games before hosting undefeated McDaniel on January 9.

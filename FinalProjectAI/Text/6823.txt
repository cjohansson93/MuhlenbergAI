Men's Tennis Battles for 5-4 Win Over Gettysburg
 Friday, March 29, 2013 - page 2







					 



Although the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team has had to battle inclement weather more often than opponents on the courts so far this season, the clouds parted long enough today for the Mules to battle things out with Gettysburg.

And battle they did.



After dropping his first set at No. 6 singles, 6-1, freshman Dylan Ander won a tiebreaker in the second set and came back from a 5-2 hole to win the third, propelling the Mules to a 5-4 victory in their conference opener.

“I knew my opponent was really tired, so I had to push through and really dig up all of the energy I had left,” said Ander of his comeback in the final 
set. “I was playing on a separate group of courts from the other matches, which was really frustrating at first. Then the whole team came over to my court and 
was cheering like crazy and that helped me come back. When they were cheering, I kind of had a feeling my match was important to the final outcome.”



Women’s Lacrosse Falls at Gettysburg


The fifth-ranked Gettysburg women’s lacrosse team pulled away in the second half to defeat Muhlenberg, 15-6.

The Mules (5-3, 0-2) trailed 9-4 at halftime and closed to within four when sophomore Stephanie Umbach netted her fourth goal of the game
2:32 into the second half. But the Bullets (8-1, 2-0) scored just 38 seconds later, kicking off a 6-0 run that put the game out of reach.

Senior Tiffany Kreider kept Muhlenberg in the game by making a career-high 14 saves. Junior Michelle Certosimo recorded
three assists.

Three of the Mules’ first four Centennial Conference games this season are against nationally ranked teams.

Also coming out on top for Muhlenberg were junior Ben Berkowitz and sophomore Eric Chavis. Berkowitz won his match at 
No. 4 singles in two sets, 7-6, 6-2. Chavis did the same at No. 5 singles, defeating his opponent 6-1, 6-2, in the only singles match that did not go three sets or
have a tiebreaker.

At second doubles, Chavis and junior Jason Teitelbaum won, 8-4, and Berkowitz and freshman Derrick Eng (right) teamed up for an 8-3 victory at third doubles.

The win came against a Bullet team that hung 8-1 and 7-1 losses on Muhlenberg the last two years.

“We felt that if we could beat Gettysburg in this first conference match and then win the rest of the matches that we are supposed to win, we have a chance 
of making the playoffs at the end of the season,” added Ander. “We really worked it out at the end and dug in deep, and fortunately we came out on top.”

Muhlenberg forced three sets at Nos. 1, 2 and 3 singles, and at No. 2 singles, freshman Max Blumenthal fell 7-5 in the final set.

“Besides just working on our all-around game, we’ve been working on serving and trying to improve our consistency,“ stated Ander of the team’s recent focus in practices.
“With matches getting delayed and with the weather being cold or rainy, we’ve had to play indoors a lot. So the important part has been keeping our eyes on the ball and continuing to play the same tennis. Whether we are inside or outside, it’s still the same game.”

The Mules will take their focus and comeback win into Tuesday’s home match against nationally ranked Swarthmore.

“We have a little break for Easter this weekend and so to get ready for Swarthmore, we are just going to recoup and get our energy back so that we can go out firing,” said Ander.

Muhlenbergâs Africana Studies Program intertwines scholarship and activism in pursuit of building an equitable world. Through interdisciplinary courses and extracurricular programming that center the histories, contributions, and legacies of Black populations, along with discussions of the history of global anti-Black racism and its contemporary reverberations, the Program uses a multi-faceted, intersectional, anti-racist approach to education to create revolutionary change rooted in racial justice.
The Africana Studies Program prepares students from all backgrounds to identify and dismantle racist systems; contribute to our diverse world in ethical, transformative ways; and embark upon a variety of career paths and life experiences equipped to be empathetic, innovative global citizens who are committed to imagining and implementing positive social change.

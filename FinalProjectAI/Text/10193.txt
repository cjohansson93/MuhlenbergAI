The lecture will take place on Tuesday, February 18, at 7 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall, on Muhlenberg's campus. The event is free and open to the public.
Kenneth Keitt is the founder and CEO of ParaPer4mance, a health and wellness fitness company focused on individuals with limited mobility. After completing his service in the United States Marine Corps, Keitt sustained an injury in an automobile collision that paralyzed him from the waist down. He received treatment at Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network.
In 2017, Keitt, then a Penn State Lehigh Valley student, received entrepreneurial funding to pursue the development of what would later become ParaPer4mance. Launched in 2019, ParaPer4mance serves as a community, a digital platform and a fitness and nutrition resource for wheelchair users. The organization seeks to empower and inspire people through health, wellness and community and has been recognized for its work by local and regional media.

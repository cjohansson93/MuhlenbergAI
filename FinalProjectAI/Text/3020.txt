two soccer players earn cc honors




Muhlenberg soccer seniors Eric Miller and Ashley O’Grady were honored as players of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Miller was named offensive player of the week after scoring five points in the lone game played by the men’s team, a 4-0 shutout of Wilkes.
Miller was involved in three of the four goals, scoring two and assisting on a third. He is second on the 2-2 Mules with seven points through
four games and leads active players with 31 career points.

O’Grady was named defensive player of the week for the third time in her career after leading a Muhlenberg defense that allowed 
DeSales and Penn State Altoona just seven shots on goal in a pair of shutout victories. 
O’Grady marked the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference preseason player of the year in the Altoona game as the Mules snapped the Lions’ 
23-game regular-season unbeaten streak. The Mules women have a shutout streak of 276:33.

four compete at last chance meet


Four members of the Muhlenberg track and field teams competed at Swarthmore’s Tuppeny Twilight Meet in their last chance to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.

The one Mule who had already qualified, junior Peter Rice, finished seventh in the 400 meters in 49.09 but did not improve his
provisional qualifying time of 48.09. Rice, who entered the meet tied for 15th on the Division III performance list, will have to wait until next
Monday to find out if he has earned a bid to the NCAA Championships.

Senior Bobby Torphy finished his career by running 3:55.20 in the 1,500 meters, while junior Marc Brookland
(45-3 in the triple jump) and freshman Stephanie Carnevale (eighth in the 100 hurdles in 15.61) ended their seasons.

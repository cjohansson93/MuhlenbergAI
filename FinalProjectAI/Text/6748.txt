Women's Basketball Drops Second Straight
 Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - page 2







					 





Junior Colleen Caldwell scored two points on an acrobatic reverse layup in the second half.




The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team went cold from the field in the second half and lost at Dickinson, 64-51.

It was a rare second loss on the road in four days for the Mules. How rare? They lost only one Centennial Conference road game all of last year, and they had suffered back-to-back setbacks in CC road games only once in the previous four seasons.

Muhlenberg (9-5, 6-3) took a 51-50 lead with 3:28 left on a pair of free throws by senior Alita Zabrecky but did not score the rest of the way. The Red Devils (9-5, 5-5) closed on a 14-0 run, going 9-for-10 from the free-throw line in the last 1:17 to make the final score not indicative of how close the game was.

The Mules led by six at halftime, but until Dickinson started going to the line at the end of the game, neither team led by more than four in the second half. After sophomore Nicole Pepe drove in for a layup to tie the score at 48 with a little more than five minutes to go, Muhlenberg missed its final 11 field-goal attempts.

Sophomore Leanna Tallamy led the Mules with 11 points, including nine in the first half. Zabrecky and Pepe finished with nine apiece.

Mules keep pace on and off track



Both the Muhlenberg womens and mens track and field teams remained among the academic elite in Division III during the 2010 season.








On the womens side, the Mules 3.42 team grade-point average ranked 30th out of 280 Division III programs. Because of its success in the classroom, Muhlenberg was recognized as one of 106 All-Academic institutions recognized by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA).










(From L to R) Nicolette Miller, Alex Faust, Kimberlee Yalango and Jennifer Lynch excelled both in the classroom and on the track.



Four members of the womens team also earned individual All-Academic recognition from USTFCCCA. 





Rising senior Bobby Torphy added a second USTFCCCA honor to an already long list of academic and athletic accomplishments.




The all-academic honor is awarded to student athletes who have compiled a 3.30 GPA and also qualified, either automatically or provisionally, for the NCAA Division III indoor or outdoor championships.

For the second year in a row, graduated seniors  Jennifer Lynch  and  Alex Faust  earned All-Academic laurels.  Faust finished fourth in the pole vault at the NCAA Division III outdoor championships, while Lynch qualified for both the 1500 meters at the outdoor championships and the mile run at the indoor meet.

Rising juniors  Nicolette Miller  and  Kimberlee Yalango  also received all-academic nods after teaming with Lynch and Faust on the Mules distance medley relay, which posted a provisional qualifying time in 2010. 

On the mens side,  Bobby Torphy  earned the second USTFCCCA All-Academic honor of his career.

A 2010 first-team ESPN The Magazine Academic All-American, Torphy represented Muhlenberg in the 800 meters at the indoor championship meet, where he received the prestigious Elite 88 Award, given to the student-athlete with the highest GPA competing at the finals site of each of the NCAAs 88 championships. 

Muhlenberg's men's squad also received recognition from the USTFCCCA. The Mules' 3.25 team GPA was good for 31st amongst all Division III institutions.

The Muhlenberg Center for Teaching and Learning seeks to cultivate on our campus a shared culture of reflection about teaching that encourages and supports meaningful experimentation. Faculty members at all career stages are essential to creating this culture as well as partnerships with staff across campus who are invested in student learning. Because reflecting on our teaching is richest in an environment that fosters an exchange of perspectives, our programs aim to provide a wide range of opportunities for collaboration among colleagues both within and across disciplines.

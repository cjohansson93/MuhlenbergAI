men’s lax falls on senior night 




Tennis Teams Fall at Washington



Both Muhlenberg tennis teams lost on the road to Washington.

The women (3-5, 2-4) fell to a regionally ranked Shorewomen (9-3, 4-2) team, 7-2. They picked up their two points at third and sixth singles, with junior Danielle Winston coming back from dropping the first set at No. 3 to win the final two, 6-2, 6-0. Junior Deniz Uzel picked up her first singles win of the season in straight sets at No. 6, 6-1, 6-0.

The Mules played several other close matches. Winston and classmate Lindsay Schmidt lost at No. 2 doubles in a tiebreak, 7-5. Freshman Amanda von Taube fell in a third-set supertiebreaker at fifth singles, 10-7.

After playing one close contest after another, the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team finally played a one-sided game. Unfortunately, that side belonged to McDaniel.

The Green Terror (6-5, 3-2) scored the first four goals of the game and was never seriously threatened, spoiling the Mules’ Senior Night with an 11-6 win.




Sophomore Alex Ardolino got the Mules on the board with his team-leading 13th goal of the season midway through the second quarter.









The loss also put a cloud on Muhlenberg’s Centennial Conference playoff hopes. Currently in sixth place with a 3-4 league mark, the Mules (4-6 overall) have to wait two weeks until their next CC game, the regular-season finale at Ursinus. With the standings so close, anything is possible, and 4-4 was good enough to make the playoff field last year.

Junior Brent Siebold scored half of the Mule goals to notch his fifth career hat trick. The second of those goals, a man-up score with 2:39 left in the third, was the 50th of his career. Since men’s lacrosse was reinstated at Muhlenberg in 2003, Siebold is only the fourth player to reach the 50-goal mark.

Ari Jacobson, one of six seniors honored before the game, had a goal and an assist and tied classmate Matthew Schroeder for the team high with five ground balls. Seniors Al Carpetto and Ivan Brown caused a turnover apiece, and the other two fourth-year men, Sean Delany and Will Garrity, each picked up a ground ball, with Garrity’s coming on a faceoff.

Carpetto’s younger brother, freshman Michael Carpetto, was 6-for-7 on faceoffs.

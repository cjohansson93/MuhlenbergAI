Volleyball Completes 3-1 Trip to Battlefield

The Muhlenberg volleyball team split its two matches on the second day of Gettysburg’s Battlefield Classic, returning home from
a successful opening weekend with a 3-1 record.

After suffering a five-set loss to Carnegie Mellon, the Mules rebounded to sweep Gallaudet. Both teams were in the NCAA Tournament last year,
and Gallaudet dealt Muhlenberg a 3-0 loss in the 2013 Buttermaker Tournament.

Junior Katherine Boll was named to the all-tournament team after hitting .297 and recording a team-leading 16 blocks in four
tournament matches. It was the third career all-tournament nod for Boll (right), who was honored at Moravian and the Buttermaker
as a freshman.

Sophomore Allison Glass recorded 14 kills with only two errors and added a career-high 19 digs against Carnegie Mellon
in a seesaw match that saw the Mules win by two points in the second and fourth sets. The Tartans went 4-0 in the tournament, and
Muhlenberg was their only opponent to force a fifth set.

Junior Chelsea Kaser notched 24 digs, and junior Sarah Weyhmuller contributed 10 kills.

The Mules hit an impressive .295 against Gallaudet, making only seven errors in the three sets. Glass led a balanced attack with 10 kills,
while Kaser (19 digs) and junior Joanne Josephson (8 blocks) paced the defense.

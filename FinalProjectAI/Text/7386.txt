McDaniel Second-Half Runs Beat Lacrosse Teams 
 Saturday, April 12, 2014 - page 4







					 






Senior Ally Shaffer scored her 11th goal of the season early in the second half to extend Muhlenberg's lead to 7-5.



Both Muhlenberg lacrosse teams fell victim to big second-half runs and dropped Centennial Conference games at McDaniel. The women went cold after a 
sizzling start and lost, 15-10, while the men saw a two-goal lead go up in smoke in the final seven minutes of a 14-12 setback.


Despite getting outshot, 19-11, the Mule women (7-5, 1-4) took a 6-4 lead into the break, mainly due to the work of sophomore Kiersten Mulvey, who made 10 saves in the first half. But in the second half, the Green Terror (7-5, 3-3) began to find the mark, going on a 9-1 run to take control.

Junior Stephanie Umbach scored on all four of her shots for her 12th hat trick of the season, tying the school record she also matched last year. Senior Michelle Certosimo recorded three assists to move to within two of tying the second record of 50 in a season.




Glancy leads the Mules with 18 goals this season – half of them in CC games.



Sophomore Casey Armstrong scored a pair of goals to reach the 50-point mark for the season. She joined Umbach and Certosimo to give Muhlenberg three 50-point scorers in a season for only the third time in program history.

Mulvey finished with 14 saves, one short of her career high.

The men, meanwhile, looked poised to win their second straight game, leading for much of the contest until a costly penalty paved the way for a 
back-breaking rally by the Green Terror.


Junior Austin Akner scored a man-down goal that gave the Mules (2-10, 1-5) an 11-9 edge with 7:12 to play. But McDaniel rattled off five straight goals in less than two minutes, with two of them coming on the man advantage that resulted from a nonreleasable infraction, to snatch a 14-11 lead with just under five minutes to play. Senior Tom Glancy finally stopped the bleeding with 1:05 remaining, but the Green Terror (6-7, 3-3) won the ensuing faceoff and ran out most of the clock.

Glancy netted a career-high four goals for his second consecutive hat trick, and junior Pat Farrell had a career-best five points on a pair of goals and three assists.

Junior Jon Thomas scored his first goal of the season, and classmate Adam Schlauch made a career-high 16 saves in net.

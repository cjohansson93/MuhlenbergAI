Volunteering Opportunities

Music Ministry
The music ministry encourages the congregation's "full, conscious and active participation" in the liturgical life of the church, especially as it pertains to music. We work to create a holy environment in which all recognize the real presence of Christ, in the proclamation of the Word, and in the Eucharist. Music aids in the spiritual life of the faithful and can foster a spirit of reverence.
Our music ministry invites all members of the congregation to bring their musical gifts to the faith community. Our opportunities include:

A choir that participates at each Mass
Occasional solo opportunities for hymns of reflection and Marian adoration
Instrumentalists to accompany our choir
Classical Pianist, as this is the primary instrumental voice of the choir

We invite you to join this vibrant and exciting part of our campus ministry. For more information, contact Mr. Andrew Trautmann.
 
Altar Serving at Mass
An altar server assists the priest with the Missal (the book of prayers of the Mass) and the preparation of the altar. Please contact Fr. Brendon Laroche if you are interested in being an altar server at Mass. 
 
Lector at Mass 
A lector is the person who proclaims the first or second reading at Mass. This person also may lead the Prayers of the Faithful at Mass. Please contact Fr. Brendon Laroche if you are interested in lectoring at Mass.

There will certainly be some blue on the map after the polls close tonight. But tomorrow, the Centennial Conference soccer map will be all red, with Muhlenberg
playing Haverford (women) and Dickinson (men) in first-round games. For a preview of the men’s game at Dickinson, please see




Championship Preview

women’s soccer hosts fords in first round


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team has developed a strong winning tradition in Leslie Benintend’s 14 years as head coach, and program alums would like nothing better than for the Mules to uphold that tradition by making a run through the Centennial Conference playoffs this week.

Actually, there’s one alum who might not be too happy with that. Jamie Gluck, who played on the Mules’ 2000 and 2001 CC championship 



Junior Kasey Hacker is third on the Mules with seven goals, including one in the first Haverford game.



teams, is now the head coach at Haverford and will bring her Ford team to Allentown to face Muhlenberg in the first round of the CC playoffs tomorrow night at 7:00.

Haverford’s overall 8-9-1 record is a bit 

deceiving, as the Fords played four games against teams currently ranked in the top 20 in Division III. Muhlenberg is 10-4-4 overall.

So far, Gluck has yet to get the better of her former coach. The Mules won last year’s game, 3-0, and claimed a 2-0 victory earlier this season, scoring two goals in a three-and-a-half minute span of the second half. Muhlenberg had a 15-7 advantage in shots.

“It’s been so long,” said junior back Ashley O’Grady of the game played back on September 30. “I remember that it was a good game.”

Muhlenberg is appearing in the CC playoffs for the sixth time in eight years. The Mules are 5-3 overall and 5-2 at home, winning a first-round home game against Ursinus in 2006 in their most recent appearance.

Haverford is in the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons and is looking for its first win. The Fords were bounced in the first round last year by Gettysburg.

“It’s a higher level of competition in the playoffs,” said O’Grady. “You know that once you’re done it’s over, so there’s that drive to keep going.”

Muhlenberg leads the all-time series with Haverford, 10-7-1. Of the last 16 meetings, 13 were decided by no more than one goal, with two of the exceptions coming the last two years.

The game figures to be low-scoring, as both teams have been solid on defense recently. The Fords have given up only two goals in their last six games, while the Mules come in unscored upon in 268 minutes.

The winner of Wednesday’s game travels to Baltimore to take on Johns Hopkins – three-time defending champion, undefeated and ranked seventh in Division III – in a semifinal match on Saturday.

Said O’Grady, “We’re going to worry about tomorrow, and then just go from there.”

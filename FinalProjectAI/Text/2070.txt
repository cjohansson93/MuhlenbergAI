Norris Muth

Name: Norris Muth
Department: Biology
General Statement of Expertise:
I am a plant evolutionary ecologist who's previous studies have focused on introduced invasive species, their effects on native communities, potential for control by biological agents and differences from non-invasive introductions. My current research addresses the role of biotic and abiotic factors in affecting tri-trophic dynamics of Lindera benzoin, its insect herbivores, their parasitoids and predators. In addition to field ecology techniques and experimental design and statistical analytical methodology, I use analytical chemistry techniques in assessing the defensive properties and nutritional value of leaf tissue.
Description of role in this project:
As postdoctoral research associate I coordinate the activities of undergraduate participants as well as conducting my own research. In particular I assist students in developing their field techniques, help plan and execute experimental designs and subsequent analyses. My own project relates to the influence of the surrounding overstory community on the dynamics of the L. benzoin system. Specifically we are investigating the potential direct and indirect effects of black walnut (Juglans nigra) allelopathic chemistry on the insect herbivores of L. benzoin.

Research Interests
The Edwards Lab investigates the physiology of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and the prevalence of human pathogens in ticks that are found in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Students in his lab gain experience in several recombinant DNA techniques as well as real-time PCR combined with field-based studies. He is also a frequent collaborator in efforts to map the geographic distribution of 17-year cicadas.

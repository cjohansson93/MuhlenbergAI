Men's Soccer, Field Hockey Shut Out at Johns Hopkins
 Friday, September 23, 2011







					 


Homewood Field was once again a house of horrors for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team.

The Mules were held scoreless at Johns Hopkins for the fifth straight game, and the Blue Jays, playing a man up, scored late in the first half to knock Muhlenberg 
from the ranks of the unbeatens, 1-0.

The physical matchup, which featured seven cards, was fairly even through the early stages, but in the 31st minute the Mules, who have never beaten 
Hopkins in Baltimore, received a red card and were forced to play the final 60 minutes with only 10 players.

Muhlenberg (5-1, 1-1) hung tough and turned away the Blue Jay advances, but in the 44th minute, Hopkins (4-2-2, 2-0) struck for what would prove to be the 
game-winner.

The Blue Jays were close to adding to their lead twice, but junior Ari Nutovits charged off his line to force a shot high on a breakaway in the 
50th minute and punched away a shot from point-blank range in the 61st minute to keep the Mules within one.

Muhlenberg turned up the offensive pressure late in the second half. Junior Nate Squire bent a free kick from just outside the box around the 
right side of the wall, but it was smothered by the Blue Jay keeper in the 66th minute.

Fourteen minutes later, sophomore Bucky Aronoff rifled a shot off a rebound from a corner kick, but it was also stopped.

In the first game of the evening, the 20th-ranked Hopkins field hockey team scored three times in the first half and once in the second for a 4-0 win.

Junior Kristen Dornenburg kept the Mules (1-6, 0-3) within striking distance by making 14 saves, including 11 in the first half.

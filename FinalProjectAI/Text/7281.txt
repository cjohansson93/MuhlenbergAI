Women's Basketball Suffers Playoff Loss to Gettysburg
 Wednesday, February 26, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team struggled with its offense in the first half and its defense in the second, falling to Gettysburg, 66-51, in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The defending champion Bullets (16-9) advance to play top-seeded Haverford in a semifinal game on Friday. The Mules ended their season with a record of 16-10, snapping an impressive streak of eight straight appearances in the CC semifinals.



Both teams dug in defensively in the first half, which ended with Gettysburg ahead, 23-18. Muhlenberg was up 10-8 eight minutes into the game but made only one field goal over the next six minutes to fall into a seven-point hole.

The Mules missed all eight of their three-point tries in the first half. That long-distance drought was broken on the first possession of the second half by a somewhat unlikely candidate, senior Erin Laney, who came into the game with a career total of one three-pointer.

But the Bullets scored the next nine points to extend their  lead to double digits, and Muhlenberg never got closer than eight points the rest of the way. Gettysburg shot close to 50 percent in the second half.

Laney later made another three – the third of her career – and finished with a game-high 16 points in her final game as a Mule. 

Two other players – Colleen Caldwell and Leeann Lanza – took the court for the last time at Muhlenberg. Caldwell (left) had three points and two assists, while Lanza (right) recorded four points, a team-high seven rebounds and two blocked shots, which moved her into a tie for second place on the program’s all-time list with 116 swats.

Junior Leanna Tallamy added 10 points to finish the season with 442, the ninth-highest total in program history.

brewer named to all-region team


Muhlenberg senior Ashley Brewer added to her growing list of honors when she was 



named to the All-East Region first team by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association late last week.

Brewer, a second-team selection last year, is the first Mule softball player to earn first-team all-region honors since Elizabeth Billie in 1999. 

Chosen as a utility player, Brewer led Muhlenberg in almost every hitting and pitching category, smashing school records for home runs (7, old record was 4) and RBI (51, old record was 36) in a season. She hit .409 with a school-record-tying 20 extra-base hits, a school-record 93 total bases and a .679 slugging percentage. In the circle, she went 13-8 with a 2.61 ERA and a school-record-tying 20 complete games.

Brewer was especially productive in the clutch, hitting .463 with runners on base and .538 with runners in scoring position. She had two-out, multiple-RBI hits in each of the Mules two NCAA Tournament games.

In the CC, Brewer ranked first in RBI (falling just one short of the CC record), home runs, total bases, wins and complete games, third in hits and slugging percentage, fourth in triples, fifth in runs scored and ERA, sixth in batting average, doubles, on-base percentage and stolen bases and eighth in batters struck out.

Brewer also has been named Centennial Conference player of the year, first-team All-CC, CC co-pitcher of the week, Academic All-District first team
and LVAIAW Outstanding Athlete since the calendar turned to May. She led Muhlenberg to the CC championship and 25 wins (one short of the school record).

For her career, Brewer hit .379 and finished as the programs all-time leader in home runs (13) and RBI (93). She also ranked second in extra-base hits, total bases and slugging percentage, third in runs scored, hits and stolen bases, sixth in batting average and eighth in on-base percentage.

Spring 2022 Announcements
Full in-person services are in place for spring 2022.
Students will be able to request to be assigned to work with a peer tutor for the duration of the semester starting on Wednesday, January 26, 2022, using our online Tutor Request Form.
Most of our course-specific workshops begin during the second week of classes. Students can review our spring 2022 workshop roster for more information. This roster is continually updated as new workshops are added.
Students looking to hone their study skills, learning strategies, organization, or planning should contact arcstudent@muhlenberg.edu to set up an initial consultation with a member of the professional staff.
Prospective students and their families are encouraged to review the ARC brochure or contact David Hallowell, Assistant Dean for Academic Life, for additional information at davidhallowell@muhlenberg.edu.
Other questions regarding the ARC or any of our services may be directed to arcstudent@muhlenberg.edu.






Mission Statement
In alignment with the mission, vision, and values of Muhlenberg College, the Academic Resource Center works to provide support for studentsâ academic transition, engagement, integration, growth and achievement through a holistic, community-based approach. Our services and practices are rooted in a humanistic model, informed by current research in education, psychology, and neuroscience.
In helping students to successfully navigate the rigors of a competitive academic environment and become lifelong learners, we provide opportunities to:

Clarify and strengthen commitment to educational pursuits;
Improve organization and planning skills;
Develop efficient, effective, and strategic approaches to learning;
Cultivate critical thinking and problem solving;
Acquire knowledge and skills important to the practice of their discipline;
Develop and demonstrate leadership abilities;
Engage in a diverse and mutually supportive academic community.

Because the developmental needs of students change and evolve during their time at Muhlenberg, the Academic Resource Center works closely with faculty and staff to identify, connect with, and support students who may benefit from the culture of care that is embodied in the mission of our department.






Location
The Academic Resource Center is located in the basement of Seegers Union, next to the Career Center and across from the bookstore.

women’s basketball celebratesdecade of success



Ron Rohn earned his 200th win as Muhlenberg women’s basketball coach when the Mules defeated Ursinus, 67-61, yesterday.

Rohn is only the fifth coach in the College’s athletic history to reach the 200-win milestone in one sport. The others are:

Sam Beidleman - baseball, 1970-1992
Dave Madeira - men's basketball, 1988-2009
Jeff Tipping - men's soccer, 1986-2001
Ruth Gibbs - softball, 1997-2008

With a 10-year record of 200-66, Rohn is the fastest Muhlenberg coach to 200 wins (Tipping did it in 277 games).

The milestone gave Rohn a chance to reflect on his career with the Mules by ranking his top 10 wins. His picks and comments are in a slide presentation that includes links to stories and videos from the
games. To watch the presentation, click on the logo below.

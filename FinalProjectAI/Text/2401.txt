âBerg Hosts 10th Annual Social Research Social Justice Conference



Muhlenberg College will host the tenth annual Social Research Social Justice Conference (SRSJ) in Moyer Hall. 


	 Wednesday, April 3, 2013  03:20 PM

The conference will take place on Friday, April 5 from 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. in Moyer Hall. Friday’s agenda includes student research presentations beginning at 9:00 a.m. and closes with a Youth Media and Social Justice panel beginning at 3:30 p.m. All events are free and open to the public.
The student research presentations draw from diverse interdisciplinary perspectives that focus on the issues of gender, religion, diversity, poverty, identity, environmental, media representation, power and more. Since its inception ten years ago, the conference has attracted more students outside of Muhlenberg’s famed red doors. This year, students from Kutztown University, Moravian College, Muhlenberg College, Lehigh University, Cedar Crest College, Lafayette College and Bryn Mawr College will present their research.
The Social Research Social Justice Conference is sponsored by the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC), The RJ Fellows Program, Muhlenberg College’s department of media and communication. The goal of SRSJ is to encourage undergraduate scholarship that aims to bring about social justice.
Muhlenberg’s department of media and communication is comprised of courses emphasizing the areas of media and communication discovery, structure, and practice. The department is the one of the largest departments on campus, with over 175 students currently pursuing a degree in media and communication.
RJ Fellows is a program for exceptional students. Once inducted into the program, RJ Fellows are afforded the opportunity to participate in challenging courses in the humanities, sciences and social sciences that develop their intellectual understanding of and capacity to affect change.

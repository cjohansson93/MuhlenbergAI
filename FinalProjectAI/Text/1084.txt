Weekly Community Update from President Harring
Tuesday, May 5, 2020

Dear students, faculty and staff,
Finals weekâWe made it! 
I want to congratulate every member of the Muhlenberg community for the strength and resilience youâve shown this semester. As we pause and prepare for the end of the academic year, this is a moment when we can reflect on what we accomplished under very trying circumstances with a sense of prideâboth as individuals and as a community.
On Friday, we shared the details of our plans to send a special paycheck to student employees whose wages were affected by the COVID-19 disruption. Students who continued to work but whose hours fell short of their expected schedule and those who were unable to continue working will receive the one-time payment. You can find more detailed information on our COVID-19 Student Resources webpage under the heading Student Employee Pay Information.
I want to offer special thanks to those students who were able to continue working remotely through the semester. For many campus departments, the professionalism of our student workers played an integral role in helping us maintain high-level operations during this time.
We hoped to communicate the details of this special payment sooner. While we were committed to making this payment, we had a number of financial decisions to make on behalf of the Collegeâwith each decision impacting othersâfor which we needed guidance concerning federal assistance. When the CARES Act was passed by Congress, we were uncertain if it would provide for lost student wages, but once we received word that it would not, we moved to finalize the details of our plan.
To our students, good luck with your finals! Remember that we will hold an End of Year Celebration May 11 with live virtual events, an online platform and opportunities to participate through social media. Please look for an email with the details.
Send your general questions about how Muhlenberg is navigating these unusual times to presquestions@muhlenberg.edu so that I can answer via video in my next messageâhere is this weekâs video update:

Please remember that when we review the questions you send, we look for themes so I can try and provide answers to some of the questions that many of you raise. If you have specific questions for a College office, please contact that office for a more detailed answer. Contact information for relevant offices can be found on the College website.
I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy.
Sincerely,Kathy HarringInterim President

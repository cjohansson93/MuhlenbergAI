no letdown for men’s soccer


They played hard from the first whistle, and they played hard even after a whistle. 

Four days after an emotionally charged 2-1 loss to eighth-ranked Johns Hopkins, the Muhlenberg men’s 



With two of its starting backs out for the game, Muhlenberg shut out DeSales with a back four that included two freshmen. One was Matthew Cecconi (above), who made his
first career start.




soccer team showed no sign of a letdown in a 3-0 win against
local rival DeSales, scoring twice in the first 7:04.

Sophomore Adison Weseloh opened the scoring just 87 seconds into the match when he stole an ill-advised pass by a Bulldog back just outside the box, dribbled in and
beat the goalie one-on-one for his team-leading fourth goal of the season. The DeSales goalie entered the game with three straight shutouts and needed to keep the Mules scoreless for 14:27 to break his own
school record for longest scoreless streak.

In half that time, he gave up two goals. Junior Greg Leischner took a pass from senior Karim Assous and had his shot deflect off a DeSales back and into the net at the 7:04
mark. Weseloh nearly added a third goal just two minutes later, but his shot was cleared off the line by a Bulldog.

“We came out shooting and got a couple of early goals, and then we were able to sit in and just play our game,” Leischner said. “We haven’t scored many goals, so it was a good change.”

It was also a change to have a two-goal margin. The Mules (6-3) hadn’t been up or down by two goals since finishing a 2-0 shutout at Moravian on September 8. Including
DeSales, Muhlenberg has played four of its last six games against teams that were in the NCAA Tournament last year. The team’s three losses are to the squads ranked
second, third and fourth in the Middle Atlantic Region, all by one goal, two on the road.

The final goal of the game was an odd one. Late in the first half, sophomore Eric Miller took a shot that headed wide of the left post. The referee blew his whistle,
apparently to signal for a goal kick, but the ball never rolled over the line. Freshman Evan Rubin tipped the ball in for his first career goal, which was finally
put on the scoreboard after some discussion.

With their first three-goal lead of the year, the Mules substituted liberally in the second half and preserved the shutout. Junior Joseph Gogel, seeing his first
action of the season, caught a rocket shot in the last five minutes to thwart the Bulldogs’ most serious threat.

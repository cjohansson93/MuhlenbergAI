Volleyball


The Muhlenberg volleyball team split its final two matches at the MIT Invitational, snapping an eight-match losing streak with a 3-0 shutout of Emmanuel. The
win was the 100th in coach Jenny Warmack-Chipman’s career.

Senior Jess Anselmi hit over .300 and averaged 4.0 digs per game in the Bronze Bracket matches against Endicott and Emmanuel. She amassed 41 kills in four matches at MIT
to move into the top 10 on the Mules’ all-time kills list with 597 for her career.

Women’s Tennis


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team had a successful first day at the ITA Southeast Regional. Two doubles teams – Danielle Winston/Lindsay Schmidt
 and Jacquelyn Magner/Sara Sutker – went 2-0 to advance to the quarterfinals of the doubles blue draw.

In singles play, four of the Mules’ seven competitors won their first match, and there was also impressive play in defeat. Freshman Caitie Druker took a ninth-seeded
player to three sets before falling in the second round, and the doubles team of Druker and junior Jenn Powell lost a close 8-6 match to the top-seeded pair.

Men’s Golf


The Mules were tied for fifth out of 13 teams after the first round of Bridgewater’s Tom Kinder Memorial. Sophomore Chris Trapp shot a 
two-over-par 74, four strokes better than senior Garrett Carpenter and junior Geoffrey Kelleman. 


When the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team gets into the late stages of its games against Gettysburg, it’s time to sing “Here We Come A-Carrolling.”

For the third game in a row, junior Brendan Carroll was a principal in a late goal in a Mule-Bullet game. Carroll’s header just 2:48 into overtime
gave Muhlenberg a much-needed 



Dalton’s goal was the eighth of his career.




2-1 win at Gettysburg.

The Mules (4-2, 1-1) are in the middle of a brutal five-game stretch in which they face, in order, Franklin & Marshall (ranked third in the region), Elizabethtown (fourth),
Gettysburg, Dickinson (fifth) and Johns Hopkins (second). Muhlenberg dropped the first two games by a goal, both on the road.

Gettysburg (4-4, 1-1) jumped on top in the first half by putting in a rebound of a shot that hit the crossbar, but the Mules tied the score early in the second half
when junior Billy Dalton scored his first goal of the year off a scramble in front of the net.

The Bullets hit the crossbar again a few minutes later; this time the ball was cleared away and the game remained 1-1 at the end of regulation. That meant it was time for
Carroll. In last year’s regular-season meeting with Gettysburg, Carroll headed a corner kick in the second overtime, leading to the winning goal. In a Centennial
Conference playoff game, Carroll scored the tying goal with 20 seconds left in regulation, although the Bullets would go on to advance on penalty kicks.

Gettysburg had the first scoring chance in overtime this game, taking a shot that was saved less than two minutes in. Muhlenberg came back down, and when sophomore
Samuel Hayden sent a long pass toward the top of the box, the Bullet goalie charged out to meet the ball. Carroll got there first, however, and headed the ball
into the net to end the game.

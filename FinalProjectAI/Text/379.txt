Payment Information Payments may be made with personal checks, cashier’s check, money order or cash. You may also wire payments for tuition (see wire instructions). Please mail the stub portion of the invoice with your payment to insure proper posting of payments to your account.
All tuition must be paid by due dates. The college is not a lender and does not extend credit. If you need information regarding educational loans, please contact our Office of Financial Aid. Muhlenberg College has partnered with Tuition Management Systems to provide a monthly tuition payment plan that helps families meet their financial obligations. The payment plan will spread tuition costs over ten months. The ten-month payment plan is an alternative to the lump sum semester payment. Payments for tuition are spread over a ten month period beginning in June and ending in March. For more information, please contact Tuition Management Systems at 800-722-4867 or access their website at www.afford.com.
Returned checks are subject to a fee of $15.00. The amount of the returned check plus the fee of $15.00 must be remitted to the controller office within two weeks.
Late Fees Failure to make payment by the specified due date will result in a late fee of $100 assigned to your account.
Registration for Classes A registration hold will be applied if there is an outstanding balance on your tuition account or if there are fines outstanding. You will not be allowed to register for the next semester classes if there are outstanding balances on your account. The registration hold will be released and the student will be able to register for the next semester classes when the outstanding balance is paid in full.
Diploma Holds A diploma hold will be placed for students who have balances on their tuition account or have fines outstanding. A transcript hold will also be placed on their account. Students are encouraged to resolve any payment issues regarding tuition, housing or parking prior to May of their graduation year.

Psychology Major
For course descriptions, view the College Catalog.
The major is designed to permit a wide range of selectivity while maintaining requirements which will give an excellent background in and knowledge of what constitutes the science of psychology.
In total, psychology majors take at least 10 psychology courses. Many students take more than 10 by the time they graduate. A minor in psychology is not offered, but students from other majors across the college are welcome to take any psychology course for which they have the prerequisites (PSY 101 is a prerequisite for all other psychology courses).
Majors are required to take:
PSY 101: Introductory Psychology
One of the following cognate courses:     MTH 119 Statistical Analysis OR MTH 121 Calculus I PSY 103: Psychological Statistics  PSY 104: Research Methods in Psychology PSY 490: Advanced Research in Psychology (OR successful completion of the Senior Thesis Program) Two Elective Courses (chosen from any course offerings except PSY 270; only one credit of PSY 970, 975, or 976 can count toward the major as an Elective; Pre-K-4 Ed students may count EDU 104 or 105 as an elective.)

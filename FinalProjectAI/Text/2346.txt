Mules honored for academics 


âFive Muhlenberg individuals and two teams were honored this summer for their academic and athletic achievements.


	 Monday, August 5, 2013  02:16 PM


Doug Rheiner (left in picture), who graduated in May, was named a Scholar All-American by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association. The program recognizes student-athletes from USILA member institutions who have distinguished themselves academically, athletically and as citizens of their communities.
The second member of the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team to earn the honor, Rheiner received honorable mention on the USILA Division III All-America team and was named to the All-Centennial Conference first team in 2013. The midfielder led the Mules with 31 goals, the second-highest single-season total in program history, and set a school record with eight hat tricks. Rheiner finished his career sixth on Muhlenberg’s all-time list with 69 career goals.
Four Mules – rising seniors Stephanie Carnevale (second from left) and Nicki Cronin (middle) and rising juniors Kirsten Kuchera (second from right) and Tyler Bauer (right) – were named to the United States Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association All-Academic Team. To qualify for the team, a student-athlete must have compiled a cumulative grade point average of 3.30 and competed in an NCAA Indoor or Outdoor Championship.
The three female athletes all competed in the NCAA indoor meet. Carnevale finished seventh in the 60-meter hurdles to earn All-America honors, while Cronin and Kuchera were members of the distance medley relay team that came in 10th.
Bauer, an All-American and Academic All-American, placed fifth in the javelin at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
Both Muhlenberg track and field squads were named All-Academic Teams by the USTFCCCA as a result of earning a cumulative team GPA of 3.10 or higher.

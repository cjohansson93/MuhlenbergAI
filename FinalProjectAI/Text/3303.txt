another second for volleyball





Freshman Davi Gordon ended the fourth set of the York match with one of her nine kills on the day. She also had three aces, all in the first game, against Stevens.


The second day of the Buttermaker Tournament followed a similar script to the second day of last weekend’s Greyhound Premiere Invitational for the 

Muhlenberg volleyball team: The Mules posted a stirring win against a team from Pennsylvania and lost to a team from New Jersey to finish second in the tournament.

This time the win was in five sets against York and put Muhlenberg into the Buttermaker championship match against 17th-ranked Stevens. The Ducks proved their prowess with a three-set sweep, giving the Mules (6-2) their second straight runner-up trophy.

Senior Megan Eiser was named to the all-tournament team, her fourth career all-tournament nod. She paced the Muhlenberg offense with 122 assists in the tournament, including 44 in the York match.

The Mules fell behind 2-1 to the Spartans, who won 30 matches last year, and trailed the fourth set 18-17 after York ran off five straight points. But behind the serving of senior Danielle Losonci, Muhlenberg responded with a five-point run of its own and went on to win, 25-22.

In the decisive fifth set, the Spartans jumped out to a 5-3 lead, but the Mules scored 12 of the last 14 points to win, 15-7. Eiser served two aces and junior Phylicia Lee one, and freshman Jackie Price added two of her career-high 10 kills, one to end the match.

Lee had her third straight match of at least 15 kills, finishing with 17 to go along with 16 digs. Junior Liz Dean recorded 11 kills without an error, and junior Brittany Williams also hit double figures in kills with 10.

The match against Stevens featured two delays due to surges that knocked out power in parts of the Life Sports Center. The first came with the Mules leading the first set, 8-7. Muhlenberg eventually built and 18-15 lead, but the Ducks were lights out down the stretch, winning 25-20.

The Mules trailed only 11-10 in the second set when the lights flickered again, but for a second time Stevens pulled away at the end, winning 25-15. A nine-point run keyed a 25-14 victory in the third set.

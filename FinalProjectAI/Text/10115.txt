Advanced Placement (College Board) credit equivalencies for each Muhlenberg department
Official College Board transcripts should be received by the Muhlenberg Registrar's Office before the beginning of the fall term and no later than the last day of a student's initial fall term.
Students are responsible to contact The College Board and request official paper score reports be sent directly to the Muhlenberg Registrar. Use the College Board score reporting services described at http://apscore.collegeboard.org/scores/score-reporting and have all of your scores sent to Muhlenberg using the four-digit college code number = 2424.
Unofficial score reports, not received directly from the College Board, (e.g., from the high school or from the student) are not accepted by Muhlenberg for awarding degree credit.
AP scores that result in Muhlenberg credit or placement are posted on your Muhlenberg record, and can be viewed on your Workday Student record, under Academics, then External Records.
If you have questions about AP courses, tests, or policies, see the College Board's Advanced Placement Program Web page.
Credit is granted at the discretion of the department head(s) involved, according to the following departmental policies in place for the coming fall term. IMPORTANT: If you receive credit for one of the following, make sure that you don't register for the same Muhlenberg course number or you will lose your AP credit.

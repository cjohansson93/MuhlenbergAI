Thousands of companies and corporate foundations match gifts to non-profit institutions such as Muhlenberg. Also, matching gifts are a great way to increase support to Muhlenberg without incurring additional out-of-pocket expenses.
Matching gifts are a very important source of support for Muhlenberg. You can double, or even triple, the value of your donation and enhance your total for gift club membership by simply notifying your employer of your gift to Muhlenberg. 
Double your impact by checking to see if your employer will match your gift. 
For more information, contact Louis Diez, executive director of annual giving.

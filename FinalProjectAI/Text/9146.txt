Mark L. Stein 
Associate Professor of History Ettinger 300E 484-664-3789
Education: B. A., History with Certificate in Asian Studies, Northwestern University, 1984 M. A., History University of Chicago, 1985 Ph.D. History University of Chicago, 2001 Teaching Fields: Middle East History Mediterranean History Balkan History As an historian of the Middle East I teach a wide variety of courses focused on that world region.  In addition to broad survey courses I offer upper-level courses on topics such as the Arab-Israeli Conflict, the Mongols, Women in the Middle East, and the Ottoman Empire.  In all my courses we will explore the diverse consequences of encounters between states, peoples, and cultures.
My training as an historian was in the social and economic history of the Ottoman Empire, and my first book was a study of seventeenth-century Ottoman administration of that empire's frontier with the Habsburgs in Hungary. My current research builds on that topic, to consider more widely the social, economic, political, and military aspects of the Ottoman-Habsburg frontier. I am also interested in the broader questions of frontier history, particularly when placed in a comparative framework. Courses Taught: Mediterranean Encounters Frontiers in History The Crusades Rise of Islam Modern Middle East Mongol Legacy Women in the Middle East Arab-Israeli Conflict Sultans, Harems, and Slaves: The Ottoman Empire Spain, Islam, and the Mediterranean World The Making of Modern Turkey Senior Seminar: Silks, Spices, and World Trade Publications:

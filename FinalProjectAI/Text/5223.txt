Junior Amanda McGovern of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

McGovern scored 11 goals and added two assists in a pair of road wins for the Mules. Against Drew, she scored five goals, including what proved to be the 
game-winning goal in the second overtime period. She scored a career-high eight points against Bryn Mawr, netting six goals on only seven shots. 
McGovern also recorded seven draw controls and five ground balls in the two games.

With 38 points on 27 goals and 11 assists, McGovern is the top scorer on a Mule team that leads the CC in scoring at 16.29 goals per game. 
She ranks third in the CC in both goals per game (3.86) and points per game (5.43).

Muhlenberg has tied the best start in program history with a 6-1 record and faces a key test on Wednesday when it hosts 7-2 Dickinson, which was ranked 20th in 
Division III last week.

Pair of Sevens Lead Baseball Team to Win in Florida
 Sunday, March 3, 2013 - page 2







					 





Sophomore Jimmy Cody, who lives in a residence hall named for Martin Luther on the Muhlenberg campus, had two hits and scored three runs against the college named
for Martin Luther. 




Although it’s not possible to roll a pair of sevens with standard dice, the Muhlenberg baseball team rolled up the runs in its first game in Florida.

The Mules scored seven runs in consecutive innings for the first time in more than 15 years, breaking open a tie game en route to a 16-2 win against Martin Luther.

The score was tied 2-2 after four-and-a-half innings before Muhlenberg (3-1) erupted for seven in the fifth and seven in the sixth. The game was called after Martin Luther was retired in the seventh.

Muhlenberg sent 11 batters to the plate in each of the big innings, combining nine hits, three errors, three walks and a hit batsman. 

Senior John Muha and sophomore Nick Plinio each had a two-run single in the fifth. Muha added a two-run double the following inning and finished the game 4-for-5 with four RBI.

Junior Brett Rosen hit two doubles in the sixth, one leading off the inning and the second plating two runs to cap the rally. He reached base in four of five plate appearances, raising his average to a lofty .636.

Sophomore Matthew Lawsky settled down after allowing two runs on four hits in the first inning. He finished his six-inning stint by retiring the last eight hitters he faced to earn his second win of the season.

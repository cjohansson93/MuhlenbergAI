The Muhlenberg men’s cross country team received one vote in the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association preseason Division III poll.

The Mules, who open up at the Lehigh Valley Championships tomorrow evening, are also ranked sixth in the Mideast Region. Of the five schools ahead of them, three are Centennial Conference rivals Haverford (11th in the national poll), Dickinson (21st) and Johns Hopkins (32nd).

Muhlenberg’s preseason regional and national acclaim comes after two seasons of sending runners for the NCAA Championships. In 2006, the Mules qualified their whole team, finishing 29th. Last year, two individuals – current seniors David Chorney and Timothy VanSyckle – ran in the national meet.

Women's Basketball Returns from Finals with Win
 Saturday, December 17, 2011







					 


Because its bus arrived in Reading well in advance of the tipoff time against Albright, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team killed time by visiting the Fairgrounds Square Mall. Most of the players chose to hang out in the store Adorable Pets, where they played with puppies and cuddled with kittens.

Then they went and tamed some Lions.

The 12th-ranked Mules (9-0) led from start to finish and defeated Albright, 80-47, in their last

game of 2011 and their final non-conference game of the season. Muhlenberg returns to action on January 4, 2012, with a home game against Centennial Conference foe McDaniel.

“The goal of today was to go into break undefeated, and that’s what we did,” said junior Julie Kelly.

Senior Alexandra Chili scored the Mules’ first 10 points of the game and finished with a game-high 19, moving to within 32 points of the program’s all-time scoring record.

Freshman Abby Stenger had her second straight impressive game, scoring 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting, and junior Alita Zabrecky added 12.

Despite playing for the first time in 10 days and after a sometimes stressful week of finals, Muhlenberg showed few signs of rust at

the start, especially on the defensive end. The Mules forced 18 turnovers and allowed only five field goals in the first half.

The Lions (3-7) went almost seven-and-a-half minutes without scoring late in the half, while Muhlenberg went on a 15-0 run to open up a 34-10 lead.

“We had three days off to prepare for finals, but most of us were in the gym during that time anyway,” said Kelly. “We knew we had to stay in shape because we had a game to get ready for too. It was definitely a balancing act.”

It is a constant balancing act on the bench, where the Mules have plenty of players eager to see court time. All 17 players who dressed for the Albright game saw action in the first half, and all but four scored at least two points in the game.

“One of the things we knew going into this season was that we had a lot of girls, and we knew somehow coach [Ron Rohn] would find a way to get everybody in,” said Kelly. “So far I think he’s doing a great job.”

Sometimes that means minimal minutes for certain players in certain games, but they have managed to be productive in the time they play. Kelly scored six points in her six minutes and said she was happy to cheer on her teammates the rest of the time.

“We all get along so well, so we’re happy for each other when we’re on the bench,” she said. “Because our team is so close, we’re able to accept when we’re on the bench. It’s like, it’s great that she’s in.”

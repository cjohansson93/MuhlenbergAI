2009-10 year in review, part 2




Winning is definitely more preferable to the alternative, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be award-worthy performances in losses. Some of these are
featured in Part 2 of the Muhlenberg Athletics Year in Review. 

On a happier note, we also have a playoff win, a no-hitter, stingy defense and some double-doubles.

Watch the slideshow by clicking the logo at the right. Here’s Part 1 if you missed it.

The Year in Review wraps up with Part 3, as well as a video review, tomorrow.

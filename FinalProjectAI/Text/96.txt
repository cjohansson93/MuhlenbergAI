With its emphasis on exploration and collaboration, the Theatre Program at Muhlenberg serves as excellent preparation for a career in theatre â or a career anywhere else.
The academic program in theatre is designed to provide majors with a thorough background in the history, theory, and literature of performance, and frequent opportunities for structured studio experiences in performance and design. Class sizes are limited, and the work is intensive and demanding. In the liberal arts tradition, each student is encouraged to individualize his or her education to fulfill personal, creative, and intellectual goals.
Read more about the theatre curriculum.
The theatre production program reinforces the philosophy that, as academic disciplines, theatre must be both intellectual and practical. Serious training and intense interaction of faculty and students as artists provide a collaborative atmosphere. Theatre students have extensive opportunities in musical theatre and dance and are encouraged to participate in the Department's award-winning productions, exploring their interests through exciting, diverse large-scale, blackbox, and concert experiences.

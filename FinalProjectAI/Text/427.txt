Harry Bertoia (American, b. Italy, 1915-1978) Spray, 1967 Stainless steel
 A student of Cranbrook Academy of Art and a resident of the Lehigh Valley, Harry Bertoia was both artist and craftsman. He worked as a designer of furniture, decorative arts, and jewelry. He was also an accomplished sculptor creating sounding pieces and other kinetic works in metal. His kinetic sculpture, Spray, defines the marriage of art and science that is ever-present in his sculpture. The kinetic energy resonates through this stainless steel piece as he successfully defined sculptural space and created tension and movement in art.

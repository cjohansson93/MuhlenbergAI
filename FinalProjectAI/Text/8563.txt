Background
B.A., M.A., Ph.D., University of California, San Diego
Harry L. SimÃ³n Salazar is a communication scholar, multimedia producer, lifelong educator, and politically engaged Chicano from Southern California. His research focuses on political communication, mediatization theory and Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Latin American Studies, political culture and identity, international media systems, border studies, and the media production of social movements. His 2018 book, Television, Democracy, and the Mediatization of Chilean Politics, demonstrates how televised political advertising, created in the context of the 1988 transition from military to civilian rule, helped transform the political culture of that country.

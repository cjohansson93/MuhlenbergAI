Research InterestsMy graduate and post-doctoral research focused on how human activities interact with and alter the biological world. I primarily studied human impacts on marine and estuarine habitats, as well as how to better manage the marine resources our society depends upon (such as fish stocks, healthy beaches, and clean water). Specifically, I explored the interaction between invasive species and other human disturbances such as habitat alteration, examining how these interactions can increase invasive species distributions and impacts within estuaries. I also worked on applying ecosystem approaches to the management of ocean resources. While I no longer actively pursue primary scientific research, I adamantly believe that science must inform management and policy decisions. To further this belief, I sit on many boards and volunteer for many organizations connecting science with local policy, education, and land management issues. At Muhlenberg, I teach many community engaged courses which allow students to see how the material they are learning informs solutions to local issues. My goal as an educator is for my students to leave Muhlenberg as engaged citizens able to contribute solutions to the big scientific and environmental challenges of our time.

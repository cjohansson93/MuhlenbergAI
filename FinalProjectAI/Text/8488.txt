There are two ways to get involved with the Sedehi Diversity Project:

1. Become an Interviewee â Every spring, the SDP Ensemble records confidential interviews with Muhlenberg students, faculty and staff as they speak candidly about issues of human diversity and multiculturalism. Verbatim quotes from these interviews are compiled into the play text that the Ensemble performs during Orientation Weekend in August. If you would like to be placed on the confidential interview list, click on the link above.
2. Become an Ensemble Member â Rising sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to apply to serve in the SDP Ensemble. Auditions are held in March of each year, and require attending an interactive workshop audition. No performance experience is necessary to be selected. If you would like to be notified of the application/audition process this spring, click on the link above.

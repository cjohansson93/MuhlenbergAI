Early goals lift Men’s soccer at tcnj





Senior Joseph Gogel made three saves for his seventh shutout of the season.


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team scored twice in the first half and coasted to a 2-0 win at The College of New Jersey in its final non-conference game of the season.

Just 4:47 into the game, senior Greg Leischner scored off a corner kick by freshman Cody Antonini. Leischner headed the ball down, and it bounced into the goal.

In the 27th minute, sophomore Tom Reilly received a through ball in the box and was in clean for a one-on-one. Reilly dribbled around the goalie, but before he could get the shot off he was taken down from behind. The goalie received a red card, and the Mules (10-4-1) received a penalty kick, which senior Billy Dalton converted.

Muhlenberg played up a man the rest of the way and had several good chances to widen its lead, but the score remained at 2-0.

The Lions (7-8-2) came into the game ranked sixth in the Metro Region and fresh off a 3-0 upset of No. 14 William Paterson. The Mules, ranked seventh in the Middle Atlantic, reached double digits in wins for the 20th time in the last 23 seasons.

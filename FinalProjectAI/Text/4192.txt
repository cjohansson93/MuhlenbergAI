Brewers arm, Klines bat power softball past Haverford





Brewer has amassed 23 wins during her career, which is good for eighth in Mule history.




Theres an old adage that says good pitching beats good hitting.

But in game one of its doubleheader with Haverford, the Muhlenberg softball team got to experience the luxury of having both.

Senior Ashley Brewer tossed the 10th shutout of her career and freshman Kelly Kline launched her second home run of the season as the Mules blanked Haverford, 7-0, in the opener. The Fords, however, returned the favor with a 3-2 win in the nightcap to force a split.

After Brewer retired the first six batters in order, sophomore Devon Barber led off the top of the third with her first of two hits on the day. Three batters later, Kline belted a two-run home run over the left field fence to give the Mules (13-10, 4-2) the lead. 

It was Muhlenbergs 10th round-tripper of the season, which doubles the Mules 2010 total.

Not satisfied with just two runs, senior Jess Kasza drew a walk and advanced to third on a single by classmate Alyssa Epstein before scoring on a wild pitch to complete the three-run inning.

The Fords (6-17, 3-7) responded with a leadoff double to start the bottom half of the third, but Brewer struck out back-to-back batters and got a comebacker to strand the runner.

She then showed her versatility in the Mules next at bat by smacking a two-RBI single that plated Barber and freshman Colleen ODonnell to push the cushion to five runs.

Brewer has now driven in 30 runs this year, which equals her total from the past two seasons combined. She is only the fourth player in Muhlenberg history to drive in at least 30 runs in a season.

The Mules tacked on two more runs in the seventh, and Brewer induced a 5-4-3 double play to complete the shutout.

She finished with seven strikeouts and only allowed four hits to pick up her sixth win of the season. 

In the second game, Muhlenberg took a 2-0 lead in the top of the third, but Haverford countered with a pair in the bottom of the frame and then added the game-winner in the fifth.

Five different Mules collected multiple hits on the day, and ODonnell picked up her team-high eighth double of the season in the nightcap.

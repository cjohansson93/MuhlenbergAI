Muhlenberg is again named one of the nation's best institutions for undergraduates, according to The Princeton Review. The publicationâs 29th annual edition of âThe Best 386 Collegesâ guide is based on surveys of 143,000 students from across the country who attend those schools.
Muhlenberg is also named a Best Value College âbased on a combination of institutional and student survey data, including academic rigor, affordability and career outcomes for graduates, among others.â 
In addition, the College again made the Green Colleges list based on its campus-wide sustainability efforts and commitments. These include a recently announced sustainability studies major, which joined a newly revised minor, last year. In February, Muhlenberg announced a joint, large-scale solar energy purchase, which along with other campus initiatives, enables the College to have a carbon-neutral electricity footprint for the first time.
Muhlenberg students responded to The Princeton Review's survey questions by saying they felt welcomed into a âclose-knitâ community and are privy to âa well-rounded liberal arts education.â Noting that their peers are extremely hardworking and friendly, respondents said students have their pick of many terrific disciplines, from the âamazing theatre departmentâ to the âextremely strongâ business and science programs. They championed their âdedicatedâ professors who âreally take the time to get to know you and answer your questions.â
In addition to a campus offering âtons of free activities over the weekends,â students said they enjoy Allentownâs public parks, which provide âgreat areas to hike, explore, bird-watch, read or take a jog.â And they periodically capitalize on Muhlenbergâs relatively close proximity to both Philadelphia and New York.
According to the profile, âa biology major sums up his peers by stating, âThere is a place for everyone on campus. We have a huge theatre program, yet almost 30 percent of our school participates in athletics, so you can see there are all extremes and everything in between.ââ Another student studying French and education offered, âmost people are involved with many different aspects of campus life, and these aspects tend not to be âcliqueyâ because of the crossover. For example, there are many football players who are members of a cappella groups or who take dance.â 
The Princeton Review is a tutoring, test prep and college admission services company. Its ranking lists are based on its surveys of students attending the 386 colleges in the book in 2019-20 and/or the previous two academic years. Only about 14 percent of the nationâs 2,800 four-year colleges are profiled in its annual guide.

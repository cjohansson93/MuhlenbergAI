Muha Ties Hitting Streak Record


The Muhlenberg baseball doubleheader at New Jersey started with a bit of history: Senior John Muha led off the first game with a single, extending
his hitting streak to 24 games, spread out over two seasons (10 games last year in 14 this year). That tied the school record set in a single season by
Chris Manfredonia last year. 

The Mules wound up scoring two runs that inning, but there weren’t many more highlights. TCNJ came back to win that game, 12-3, and finished the sweep with
a 15-1 win in the nightcap.

Muha had two hits in the opener, as did senior Joseph Vila but his streak was snapped in the second game. Sophomore Chris Flynn
drove in the lone Muhlenberg run of the nightcap with a ninth-inning double.

It was far from a perfect day for tennis, but sophomore Daniel Lakhman nearly had a perfect day at the top of the lineup in Muhlenberg’s first
home match of the spring season.

In the Mules’ 9-0 shutout of Arcadia, Lakhman teamed with freshman Max Blumenthal for an 8-0 win at first doubles, then won his first
singles match, 6-1, 6-0.

Muhlenberg dominated up and down the lineup, dropping only 10 games in six singles matches. Junior Ben Berkowitz (No. 4) and freshman
Dylan Ander (No. 6) both recorded 6-0, 6-0 shutouts, while junior Jason Teitelbaum won his first set at love.

The closest match of the day came at No. 3 doubles, where Berkowitz and freshman Derrick Eng trailed 5-4 before winning the final four games for
an 8-5 victory.

Sophomore Eric Chavis (right) was a winner at second doubles and fifth singles.

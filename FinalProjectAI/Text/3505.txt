Saturday, Muhlenbergs Spencer Liddic broke a single-season scoring record that had stood for 40 years. 

Tuesday, the junior captain accomplished something that had not been done by a Mule in 30 years when he was named to the Capital One Academic All-America Mens Basketball first team, as chosen by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

Liddic became the 20th first-team academic honoree in Muhlenberg athletics history, but only the third Mule basketball player, and the first since Dan Barletta in 1981, to be named to the first team. 

A double major in business administration and finance, Liddic was also named first-team Academic All-District this season after garnering second-team honors last year.

On top of being named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll, Liddic is a two-time member of the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Scholar-Athlete Team. 

Liddic, who is spending this semester interning with a Bethlehem-based financial firm, said he plans on pursuing a career in finance upon graduation from Muhlenberg. 

But before he turns his attention to his business career, Liddic still has another season to get back to business assaulting the Muhlenberg record books. 

The power forward led the Mules in both scoring and rebounding this past season. He currently sits in 15th place on the schools all-time scoring list with 1,221 points and ranks 16th in CC history with 712 career rebounds.

"The Only Station That Matters"
WMUH is a Class A non-commercial educational radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. Starting as a student radio club at Muhlenberg College in 1948, WMUH progressed to AM, then FM and has been streaming worldwide since 2000.
In 1979, WMUH was granted a power increase to 440 watts, providing the station a primary reception area with a radius of approximately 35 miles. The coverage includes the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton and Phillipsburg NJ.
 






WMUHâs operations are governed by a Board of Directors and overseen by the General Manager. The four elected members appoint the board: Station Manager, Program Director, Secretary and Business Manager. These officers in addition to the General Manger comprise the Executive Committee.
Each member of the board oversees an area of the stationâs operation, with all the operations being overseen by the Station Manager. Any member of the community is eligible to serve on the staff with the approval of the Student Board. The stationâs studios also serve as a training lab for students enrolled in communications courses.
As one of the resources of Muhlenberg Collegeâs student activities programing, the Office of Public Relations supervises WMUH. The office is responsible for appointing a General Manager to represent Muhlenberg College.
The General Manager works with the stationâs board of directors to direct the stationâs operations, including adherence to FCC regulation. The General Manager also works with the Vice President of Public Relations to develop long terms goals for the station.

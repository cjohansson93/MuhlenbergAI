On Wednesday, March 23, 2005 at 7:30 p.m., Muhlenberg College will host visiting scholar and arts activist Dr. Petra Kuppers who will give a lecture entitled, “Disability Arts: Celebrating Difference,” in the Lithgow Science Auditorium, Trumbower Hall. This event, sponsored by the humanities seminar, is free and open to the public.
Kuppers is a visiting scholar at Brown University and Perfomance Studies professor in English and cultural studies at Bryant University. Her lecture will include videos of performances that challenge disability stereotypes to work towards social change.
Kuppers is anticipated to explore themes such as identity politics, stigmatisms of mental health diagnoses, interactions between space and body, notions of beauty, dignity and the place of art in everyday life.

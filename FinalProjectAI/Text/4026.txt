Wet conditions cant slip up womens lacrosse against Garnet





Rosen is one of just five players in Mule history that has scored at least 40 goals in two different seasons.



On more than one occasion during the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse game with Swarthmore, Mule players had to stop to wipe their eyes.

With a steady drizzle falling for much of the game, they were having trouble seeing clearly.

But the Mules had no problem finding the Garnet cage as they used an early four-goal run to take control and beat Swarthmore, 15-7.

Coming off of Saturdays win we were really excited and wanted to keep the momentum going, sophomore Molly Davin said. We came out and played well from the start and were able to pick up a big win.

For the second game in a row, the Mules got out in front fast when Davin found junior Sarah Hetrick cutting to the cage for a quick goal just 26 seconds into regulation.

Sophomore Alex Bellini added a free-position goal three minutes later before Swarthmore (8-5, 2-4) got on the board.

Thats when Davin and senior Danielle Rosen took over. The duo outscored the Garnet 6-3 to go into halftime with the Mules up by four.

Rosen, who finished with six goals and eight points, surpassed the 200-point plateau and moved into third place on the schools all-time scoring list. The prolific attacker has now scored 201 points during her Mule career.

Davin, meanwhile, set a career high with five goals and tied her personal best with six points.




Vachon has compiled a .690 save percentage during the past two games.



We know each others strengths and know how to play well together," Davin said of Rosen. "She knows where Ill be on the field, and I know where to find her. So we can create some good opportunities.

Danielle is a great player. She is a great teammate, and I look up to her as an attacker. She works so hard at everything she does and definitely deserves to be among the best in Muhlenberg history.  

While Muhlenbergs attack was harassing the Swarthmore goalie, the defense more than held up its end of the bargain.

Led by senior Allisyn Vachon, who finished with 14 saves, including several from point-blank range, the Mules (6-6, 2-4) limited the Centennial Conferences highest scoring team to just seven goals, which tied its season-low.

Muhlenbergs defenders were active all day, routinely thwarting Garnet attackers before they could get near the cage. Freshman  Kaitlyn McCaffrey caused five turnovers, and senior Lauren DeCarle controlled five draws to help the defensive effort.

Allisyn played great today, Davin said. When you see her making big saves and the defense getting turnovers it makes you want to score even more. We want to give the defense a little break and then make their work pay off with a goal.

Swarthmore was able to close to gap to three, 9-6, with 20:47 to play, but the Mules scored the next five goals to put the game away.

With the win, Muhlenberg got back to .500 on the season. And according to Davin, with three games to play the Mules are hoping to close the season strong and make a run at the postseason.

We need to stay focused and keep this momentum going, Davin said. We need to keep on playing well as a team and hopefully well keep on winning and get into the playoffs.

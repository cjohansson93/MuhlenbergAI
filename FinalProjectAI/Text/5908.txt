Three Volleyball Seniors Win Final Home Match

To pay tribute to their three seniors, the underclassmen on the Muhlenberg volleyball team hung three banners on the walls of Memorial Hall for Senior Night. The one for oft-injured Davi Gordon was decorated with a pair of crutches.

In reality, though, it was Gordon and fellow seniors Jackie Price and Brooke McQueen who were leaned on and provided the support needed for a young Mule team to have a turnaround season.

Muhlenberg made its Senior Night a festive one with a 3-1 win against Ursinus in not only its final home match, but also its final Centennial Conference match. The win enabled the Mules to end their CC campaign with a 5-5 record, a marked improvement from last year’s 2-8.

“I really look to the seniors as leaders,” said Holly Hynson, one of six freshmen on the 12-player roster. “They’re always there pumping us up. In timeouts, they’re the ones always telling us what to do. They’re a source of inspiration for the whole team.”

They were also a great source of production against the Bears. Price hit .464 on a team-high 13 kills without an error in 28 attempts, Gordon

put down 10 kills, and McQueen recorded a career-high 33 digs.

Muhlenberg (7-17 overall) pulled away 
late to capture the first set, 25-22, and took the second, 25-19. Price recorded 10 kills  in only 15 attempts in the first two sets.

Ursinus (12-12, 3-7) broke open a close third set with a late 9-0 run and went on to win, 25-18. The Bears were threatening to force a fifth set when they opened up a 13-5 lead in the fourth, but Gordon helped turn the match around with a hard slam that went off the head of an Ursinus player.

The Mules scored the next three points to close to within 13-9 and eventually tied the set at 18. A kill by Price put Muhlenberg ahead for good, and freshman Lindsey Gambocurta finished off the 25-22 win with her fifth kill.

The three seniors combined for 26 kills with only two errors. Gordon and Price had three blocks apiece, and McQueen, who has played in the front row for most of the season, donned a red shirt and spent the match at libero, winding up with the most digs in a match by a Mule in two years.

“That was coach’s idea,” said McQueen of her move to libero. “That’s where I wanted to play since day one of preseason. It was fun to play back row again.”

Gambocurta (16) and sophomore Erica Wenzel (11) joined McQueen in double figures for digs, while Hynson recorded 10 kills. Sophomore Morgan Duggan and freshman Nikki Dickson combined for 40 assists.

It all helped the seniors leave their home floor for the last time on the winning side.

“It’s surreal. It doesn’t feel like it’s over. I almost teared up at the end,” said McQueen. “But if it is over, that was a good way to go out.”

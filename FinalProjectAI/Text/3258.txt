pleasing win for men’s soccer at desales




Senior Greg Leischner was a crowd favorite as he scored one goal and assisted on another, leading the Muhlenberg’s men’s soccer team to a 3-1 win over 



Tenenzapf (2) celebrates with his teammates after scoring his third goal of the season. His goal was the fastest for the Mules to start a game since last year vs. DeSales, when they needed just 1:27 to get on the board.



DeSales.
 
After Muhlenberg (7-3-1) went up 1-0 less than two minutes into the game off sophomore Tom Reilly’s slow roller to senior Steven Tenenzepf, 
Leischner kicked a shot from 40 yards out. Although it went high over the net, the student crowd was pleased. 

“Ambitious, Leisch,” one student called out. “I like it.” 

Leischner pleased the crowd even more with 13:40 left in the half when, off a corner kick, he tapped the ball back to senior Billy Dalton, who shot it in from about 20 yards out for his third goal of the season and a 2-0 Mule lead. 

DeSales ruined the shutout 12 minutes into the second half. The goal was the first allowed by senior Joseph Gogel in 167 minutes.
 
Leischner found the net about six minutes later. A corner by freshman Cody Antonini was flicked by Reilly to Leischner, who headed it in. 

Tenenzapf’s nickname is Animal, but after the game he claimed that Leischner is an animal too. Leischner’s goal was the first of the season and fifth of his career. 

“We’re playing really well, we’re really clicking,” said Leischner. “We have a great back line and a great goalie back there to stop everything on the field.”

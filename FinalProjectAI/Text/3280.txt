rathbun named player of the week



Senior linebacker Matt Rathbun of the Muhlenberg football team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Rathbun led an outstanding defensive effort in the Mules’ 31-14 win at Union. He made a team-leading eight tackles, including two tackles for loss and a sack, 
and returned an interception 41 yards to halt a Union drive in the red zone and set up Muhlenberg’s fourth touchdown.

The Dutchmen scored their first touchdown on a short field following a turnover and their second against the second-team defense on the last drive of the game. Except for that
last possession, Union did not have a drive of longer than six plays or 32 yards. The Mules held the Dutchmen to 43 rushing yards, 12 completions in 32 attempts and 
two third-down conversions in 15 tries.

Through two games, Rathbun leads Muhlenberg with 16 tackles. The interception was the third of his career to go along with a school-record eight fumble recoveries.

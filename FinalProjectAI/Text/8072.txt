Cross Country Teams 5th, 7th at CC Championships
 Saturday, November 1, 2014 - page 3







					 






The Muhlenberg women’s cross country team finished fifth, and the men placed seventh at the Centennial Conference Championships.

The women ran extremely well in arguably the best Division III cross country conference in the nation. 
They finished behind four teams ranked in the top five in the Mideast Region and were 10 points ahead of Bryn Mawr,
which has been regionally ranked this season.


The women were led by junior Melanie Tramontina, who came in 29th, with freshman 
junior Claire Thornton (35th), freshmen Mallory Snyder (38th) and 
Emily Davidson (42nd) and sophomore Hannah Binder (59th) rounding out the top five.
Thornton (left) improved her CC finish by 22 places from last year.

This was the fourth straight year for the women to finish in the top five at the CC meet, a streak unprecedented in program
history.

The men were just 10 points away from fifth-place Franklin & Marshall in a highly competitive and tight race. 

Sophomore Jaryd Flank crossed the finish line in an impressive 18th place, up two spots
from last year. He is the first Mule to post back-to-back top-20 finishes at the CC meet in six years.  

The top five for the Mules was rounded out by seniors Luke Munyan (right) in a career-best 27th, 
Josh Elkan (56th), Zach Lifman (60th) and Kenny Wohl (62nd).

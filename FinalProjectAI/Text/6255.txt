Women's Tennis Drops Tight Match at Haverford
 Wednesday, April 4, 2012







					 




For the second time in less than a week, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis match came down to the very last point.

Unfortunately for the Mules (2-5, 2-3), this time things did not go their way, and Haverford picked up a 5-4 win in a showdown of regionally ranked teams and a rematch from last year’s Centennial Conference playoffs.

The Fords (9-6, 5-1), who check in at No. 16 in the Atlantic South region, won a 9-7 tiebreak in the final match to upend the Mules (No. 12) and cap the four-and-a-half hour match that had to be moved indoors after the sun went down.

Junior Amanda von Taube (left) and freshman Sharen Resnikoff teamed up to grab Muhlenberg’s lone doubles point and also won their respective singles matches. They won 8-5 at No. 3 doubles and only dropped four games apiece in singles play.

Sophomore Gabriela Contino picked up her first win of the season, 7-5, 6-2, at No. 5 singles.

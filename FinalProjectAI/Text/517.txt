Facilities and Equipment
 

Trumbower Building
The Peter S. Trumbower Science Building houses the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. In addition to modern laboratories, lecture halls and classrooms, the building contains special student and faculty and research facilities.







Science Street
Trumbower renovations included expanded space for the chemistry department and improvements for the math and physics department. Trumbower is also the home of the Lithgow Science Auditorium.


The Shankweiler and New Science Buildings
The Trexler Tower was completed in 2007 and the Shankweiler Building was totally renovated that year as well. The completion of these two projects allows access from the new science building, to Shankweiler and now to Trumbower Hall, completing "Science Street". Shankweiler houses the biology department and the Acopian Center for Ornithology.

The New Science Building Entrance (The Biochemistry homespace is located directly above)
Opened in fall 2006, the new science building provides spectacular new space for labs, office and student-faculty research. In addition to the biology and biochemistry labs, there are neuroscience, physiology, histology, environmental science, botany, ecology, anatomy and human anatomy research spaces.

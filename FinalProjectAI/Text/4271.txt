welcome home!two spring athletes honored



Two Muhlenberg senior female athletes who went south for Spring Break last week were honored by the Centennial Conference after returning to Allentown.

Ashley Brewer was named player of the week in softball, and Danielle 



Rosen earned the same honor for womens lacrosse.

Brewer hit .556 and drove in 11 runs in a 3-2 week for the Mules in Clermont, Fla., with both 
losses coming to 2010 NCAA Tournament teams. She set a school record with 7 RBI and became the programs all-time leader in home runs in a 15-4 win against Northwestern. Brewer also had a double, a triple and two stolen bases on the week.

For the season, Brewer is batting an even .500 with a .792 slugging percentage. She has driven in a team-leading 13 runs  matching her total from all of last season  with her 12 hits and also is 2-1 with a 3.06 ERA and 13 strikeouts in 16 innings as a pitcher.

Rosen scored 14 points on 5 goals and 9 assists in two games in Hilton Head, S.C., leading the Mules to a pair of wins that kept them undefeated on the season. She scored 8 points (3G, 5A) vs. Rochester and 6 (2G, 4A) vs. Susquehanna. In the latter game, she assisted on the go-ahead goal and later added an insurance tally as Muhlenberg scored the final three goals for a 13-10 win.

Rosen is second in the CC in scoring with 28 points in four games. Her CC-leading 15 assists have moved her into fifth place on the Mules all-time list with 57 for her career.

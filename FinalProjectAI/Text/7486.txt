Baseball Picks Up First Win on Spring Trip
 Wednesday, March 5, 2014 - page 3







					 




The Muhlenberg baseball team received back-to-back outstanding efforts from its starting pitchers in Myrtle Beach, converting the second one into a win to snap its four-game losing streak.



Yesterday, junior Nick Gies pitched into the eighth inning of a 4-1 loss to Wilkes. He gave up only four hits and one unearned run in the first seven innings and left in the following inning with the score tied 1-1, two outs and a runner on first. That runner, and two more, came around to score, handing Gies the tough-luck loss.


The Mules scored a run on two errors and a double steal in the first inning but were shut down the rest of the way, managing just two hits.

Sophomore Tim Hofmann, making his second career start, took a shutout into the seventh and earned his first career win as Muhlenberg broke into the win column on its spring trip with a 6-2 defeat of Eastern.




Icaza slides safely into second for his second double of the season.



Hofmann (left) allowed only two hits, both on bunts, and allowed only three fair balls to be hit out of the infield in his 6 2/3-inning stint. The southpaw struck out three, and both of the runs he gave up were unearned.

The Mule batters gave him room to work by scoring in three of the first four innings. A hit batter with the bases loaded brought in a run in the second, and Muhlenberg (3-4) added two in the third on a wild pitch and groundout.

In the fourth, freshman John Icaza doubled in a run and scored on a groundout to make it 5-0. Two innings later, senior Tyler Latrenta drew a leadoff walk, stole second and third, and scored on Icaza’s hit through the drawn-in infield.

Junior Austin Cush closed out the game with help from his battery-mate. The Eagles had two on with one out in the ninth when they tried a double steal. Senior Brett Rosen, who earlier in the game picked a runner off second base, gunned down the trail runner for the second out of the inning. The next batter grounded out to end the game.

In addition to Icaza, Rosen, senior Nick Kennedy and juniors Jimmy Cody and Nick Plinio all had two hits.

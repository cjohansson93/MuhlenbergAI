Weather Nicer Than Results for Two Mule Teams at Home
 Tuesday, April 9, 2013







					 


With temperatures near 80 on the warmest day of the year, it was a great afternoon to spend plenty of time outside. Two
Muhlenberg teams played long contests against ranked Haverford teams, but the weather proved more enjoyable than the results.




Vila's home run was the 11th of his career.



Baseball lost 17-9 in a game that lasted more than three hours, and women’s tennis fell 5-4 in a match that went for nearly four hours.

The baseball team looked to be in for a long afternoon when the Fords (19-3, 4-3), ranked 23rd in Division III, scored six runs in the top of the first. The Mules (14-12, 2-5) battled back, however, closing to within a run at 7-6 after three.

Haverford scored twice in the top of the fourth, but Muhlenberg powered up to match the two runs on solo homers by seniors John Muha and Joseph Vila.

The Fords extended their lead to 10-8 with a run in the fifth, then blew the game open with five in the sixth, with four coming on a grand slam.

Muha went 4-for-5 for his fifth four-hit game of the season, raising his Centennial Conference-leading batting average to .509. With 13 games left on the schedule, he is just five short of the school record of 61 hits in a season.

Sophomore Kurt Johnson also went 4-for-5, including a double, and junior Tyler Latrenta and sophomore Danny Usewick had a pair of hits apiece.

Women’s tennis could not repeat Saturday’s comeback from a 2-1 doubles deficit as the Fords, ranked 12th in the Atlantic South Region, won three of the first four completed singles matches to clinch the match.

Juniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman teamed up for a marathon 9-8 (7-5) win at No. 1 doubles against a Haverford duo that came in with a perfect 5-0 CC record, including a win against the No. 1 doubles team of nationally ranked Johns Hopkins in its previous match.

Sophomores Jennifer Goldberg and Sharen Resnikoff and senior Amanda von Taube won their singles matches.

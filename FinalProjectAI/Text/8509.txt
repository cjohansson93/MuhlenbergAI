Student Self-Governance
Subject solely to the statutory regulations of the Board of Trustees and of the Faculty, the SGA represents undergraduate students in voicing their concerns, promoting student interests, and advocating for student life and academic concerns at Muhlenberg College.
The Muhlenberg College Student Government is a founding member of the American Student Government Association.
Structure The Student Government Association is composed of 22 student representatives and a Student Body President elected "at large" annually on the third Monday of April. The other offices of the association - a vice president, a recording secretary, an executive secretary, and a treasurer - are elected by the seated members of the SGA at the first meeting transition meeting before the start of the fall semester.
MeetingsRegular meetings are held weekly as the academic schedule permits. Meetings are held virtually on Wednesday evenings at 5:30 p.m. Members of the student body are invited to attend to observe their government in action or to raise issues and concerns.
Representation
The Student Government Association is responsible for coordinating the representation of the student body on all institutional, faculty, ad hoc, and Board of Trustee committees. A student need not be a member of the SGA to serve as that voice, but will be expected to meet regularly with the SGA so that the opinions of the student body can be gathered and returned to each committee.

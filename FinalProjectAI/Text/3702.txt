Dornenburg Sets Record in Field Hockey Loss


Sophomore Kristen Dornenburg had a busy evening as the Muhlenberg field hockey team lost at third-ranked Ursinus, 12-0, in its second-to-last game of the regular season.

Dornenburg set a school record with 26 saves, breaking the 13-year-old mark of 24 established by Allison Neet against East Stroudsburg. She had 22 saves in the first half alone.

The 26 saves gave Dornenburg an even 250 for her career. She ranks seventh on the Mules' single-season list with 139 this year.

half. Less than two minutes into the second half, the Mules tied the score when freshman Stephanie Tramutola sent a strong cross from the right flank into the box, from where classmate CJ Graetzer slammed the ball off the hands of the Ursinus goalie and into the net.

Just like the first half, the second featured only and early goal, and the teams went into overtime. Junior Michele Toher made three of her 11 saves in the overtime periods, including one while falling back in the first extra 10 minutes. But with 3:53 left in the second overtime, Muhlenberg was called for a foul in the box, and Ursinus converted the penalty kick to win.

All three of the Mules' CC losses are by one goal on the road, two in double overtime.

The loss left Muhlenberg in a four-way tie for third place in the CC with one game remaining in the regular season. The Mules can clinch a playoff berth by winning at Gettysburg on Saturday and would probably get in with a tie, unless nationally ranked Johns Hopkins loses to either McDaniel or Ursinus in its final two games.

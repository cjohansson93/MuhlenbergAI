freshmen help hoops teams win openers


Having lost a total of three varsity letterwinners from last year, the Muhlenberg basketball teams went into the 2008-09 season counting on their experience. Judging by the first night, both Mule teams also made nice additions in the offseason.

Newcomers were impressive as 



Boyle scored six of Muhlenberg’s first eight points. In addition to her 14 points, she recorded three steals and a pair of assists.



both Muhlenberg teams reached the Scotty Wood Tournament final for the 15th time in 16 seasons. 

The women defeated St. Elizabeth, 73-36, to reach the championship against William Paterson. The men led by only two at halftime but pulled away to topple Hunter, 77-59. They will face Marymount in the final in a rematch of the 2004 title game.

The women’s game was never in doubt as Muhlenberg tied the Scotty Wood Tournament record for fewest points allowed in a game. The Mules jumped out to a 12-2 edge and led by as many as 40 points. They forced 31 turnovers and owned a 61-30 advantage on the boards.

Senior Lauren Boyle led 12 Mules in the scoring column with 14 points (on 7-of-11 shooting) in only 17 minutes. Sophomore Sheila Cook added 10 points, and senior Erin McSherry was close to double-double territory, finishing with eight points and nine rebounds.

Muhlenberg’s freshman quartet of Alexandra Chili, Kimberly Mui, Kathleen Naddaff and Katy Rossino combined for 24 points, 17 rebounds, 



Barnes had a pair of crowd-pleasing dunks in the last six minutes of the game.



10 assists and eight steals. Mui and Naddaff scored seven points apiece, with Chili dishing out a game-high six assists.

The men had to work harder for their win. A tight first half, featuring two 
ties and five lead changes, ended with Muhlenberg up by two, 30-28. 

The teams continued to seesaw back and forth at the start of the second half. Seven minutes into the second period, a Hunter basket made the score 42-41, and the Mules responded with a 10-0 run to take command.

Junior Ryan Foster kicked off the run with back-to-back three-pointers, and senior Tim Murray finished it with a pair of buckets.

Foster finished with a team-high 19 points, and junior Obi Nwizugbo added 13. Sophomore Evan Tozer gave the team a nice lift off the bench, contributing six points, five assists, three steals and three rebounds.

Junior Peter Barnes teamed with freshman Spencer Liddic to give Muhlenberg an imposing presence in the post. Barnes scored a career-high 18 points on 9-of-13 shooting and added 14 
rebounds for his second career double-double. (corrected 12/1) Liddic notched eight points and nine rebounds in his debut, helping the Mules to a 54-30 rebounding advantage.

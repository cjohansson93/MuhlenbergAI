Internships
An internship is a work experience characterized by intentional learning. During this experience, the student assumes a responsible role in an organization and actively reflects on what he or she is observing or learning. Students who wish to receive academic credit for their internship take PSY 960: Internship Seminar. The seminar provides students with an opportunity to connect their academic knowledge with experiences, expectations, values, and demands of the world outside the classroom. Students meet weekly to discuss professional, psychological, ethical, and other issues relevant to the internship experience.
 











          Finding an Internship
  








Students are responsible for securing their own internship position and it is best to start the search as soon as possible. We encourage you to look for positions that would be of most interest to you. A conversation with the Career Center, a Google search, checking LinkedIn or Idealist.org, or a check in with fellow students who have done internships are the best routes to go. You can also search the websites of other local colleges and universities to see if they provide additional ideas (Moravian, Cedar Crest, DeSales, Lehigh). 
Some businesses or organizations will not have a job posting or internship posting on their website. However, you can call these places, indicate that you are a Muhlenberg student, and express your interest in a possible internship position.

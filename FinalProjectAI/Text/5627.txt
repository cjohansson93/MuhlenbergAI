conti named player of the week



Junior outfielder Christian Conti of the Muhlenberg baseball team was named player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Conti hit .536 with a 1.000 slugging percentage as the Mules split eight games in Florida. Of his 15 hits, eight were for extra bases, including five triples. 
Conti scored 13 runs, including the game-winner in extra innings against Aurora, and drove in nine.

After eight games, Conti is already just the second Muhlenberg player since 1995 to belt five triples in a season; the school record is eight. For his career, Conti has eight
three-baggers in just 112 at-bats.

Conti was one of the leaders of a Mule lineup that hit .339 and averaged nearly nine runs per game on its spring trip.

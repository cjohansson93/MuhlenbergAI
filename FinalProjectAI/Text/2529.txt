Mary C. Boys and Ruth Langer to Deliver 2014 Wallenberg Lecture


âBergâs Institute for Jewish-Christian Understanding Celebrates 25th Anniversary



	 Thursday, September 11, 2014  09:23 AM


The 2014 Wallenberg Tribute lecture, “Overhearing our Own Prayers: Jewish and Christian Worship in an Age of Religious Pluralism,” will be delivered by Mary C. Boys and Ruth Langer on Sunday, September 14, 2014, at 3:00 pm in the College’s Baker Theatre, Trexler Pavilion. This talk is co-sponsored by the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley and is free and open to the public. This year marks the IJCU’s 25th anniversary and the 30th year of the Wallenberg Tribute. 
Boys is dean of academic affairs and Skinner and McAlpin Professor of Practical Theological Seminary in New York City. She is a leader in Jewish-Christian engagement and in reframing Christian self-understandings in light of the renewed relationship with Jews and Judaism that are a hallmark of our time. As a religious educator and veteran teacher, she brings to her work a critical understanding of the ways in which every day practices and implicit messages shape attitudes and values. Her work has been recognized with several honorary doctorates and this fall she will receive the Shevet Achim Award of the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations.
Langer is professor of theology and associate director of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass. She is an expert in Jewish liturgy and a daily participant in Jewish-Christian encounter in her classroom. In her extensive publications, she has analyzed such classic questions as the history of Birkat ha-Minim (the daily Jewish prayer against heretics), the “liturgical parting(s) of the ways,” and liturgy in light of Jewish-Christian dialogue. She currently chairs the Council of Centers for Jewish-Christian Relations, co-edits the online journal Studies in Jewish-Christian Relations and is a partner in the Promise, Land and Hope project of the International Council of Christians and Jews.
Boys is a past chairperson of the Christian Scholars Group on Jewish-Christian Relations, which is sponsored by the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning at Boston College where Langer is Associate Director. That group is holding its semiannual meeting at Muhlenberg September 12-14 in conjunction with the IJCU’s 25th anniversary program. IJCU Founding Director Franklin Sherman and CSG founding member Alice Eckardt, professor emerita at Lehigh University and a member of the IJCU board, will be feted by the group at its opening dinner on Friday evening.  Both have announced that this will be their final meeting with the group as they resign in order to make way for younger scholars in the field. They will be recognized by the IJCU as Leaders in Understanding for their significant roles in the group over many decades.
The Wallenberg Lecture is named for Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Budapest Jews from the Nazis during the last year of WWII. He was taken into Soviet custody just days after Budapest was liberated and was never again accounted for by Western sources; some Soviet reports put his death in 1947 in a Moscow prison.
Each year since 1985, Muhlenberg College and the IJCU have paid tribute to his courageous moral action on behalf of others with a public presentation by a significant scholar or public figure. Since the Institute’s inception in 1989, the event has included the honoring each year of one or more local individuals who are recognized for their courageous moral action on behalf of others.

Student Achievements & Hometown News Program
The office of communication uses Merit, an online service, to promote our students' accomplishmentsâincluding academic awards, research projects, theater and dance performances, study abroad and graduation. News stories about your college achievements are sent to your hometown media outlets. You, your parents and your high school will receive an email notification about each announcement as well.
Each student has an individual Merit page which helps you create an institution-verified online identityâa visual resume that showcases your achievements from enrollment through commencementâthat can be shared with prospective employers, graduate schools and others.
Any time Muhlenberg uses Merit to promote your accomplishments, your personalized Merit page will be updated automatically. Customize your page by adding a photo and additional activities, such as community engagement and work experiences. You can also connect your Merit page to a LinkedIn page.
You can opt out of having a Merit page at any time, or keep your Merit page active, but adjust your privacy settings. Read more here.
Any questions or concerns? Please contact Kristine Yahna Todaro at kristinetodaro@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-4343.

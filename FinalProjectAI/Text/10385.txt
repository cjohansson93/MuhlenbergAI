A college is the sum of its people, buildings, facilities, labs and gathering spaces. 
Capital gifts to Muhlenberg add new beauty and interest to its landscape, and further enhance the quality of the academic and student experience that is delivered.  
These gifts set in motion new buildings, expanded learning, and professional and career development opportunities - they illustrate the vitality of the institution for all to see.
For more information on a variety of important capital projects to which you can lend your support, and help to build Muhlenbergâs future, contact Mike Gardner, principal gift officer, at mikegardner@muhlenberg.edu.

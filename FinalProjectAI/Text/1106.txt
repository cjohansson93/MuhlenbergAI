More Spring Planning Information for Faculty and Staff



A message from Provost Laura Furge to Muhlenberg faculty and staff

Tuesday, January 4, 2022

Good afternoon, 
This morning an email was sent from President Harring to the entire Muhlenberg Community regarding our ongoing response to COVID-19. We are thankful for all the support and engagement you have provided to one another, our students, families, and friends of the College. While we had hoped that weâd be in a different place by now with the pandemic, we find that the situation continues to be fluid and we want to provide some follow-up information on campus COVID-19 protective measures: 

Vaccines with Booster Required: Fully vaccinated individuals (with the booster) who test positive for COVID typically experience greatly reduced symptoms, a reduced transmission period, and protection from severe illness. As communicated on December 20, 2021, all employees are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with the booster, no later than February 1 (or within 30 days of becoming eligible). Employees with previously approved religious or medical exemptions do not need to request renewed exemptions for the booster.
Booster Eligibility: The CDC updated booster guidelines today.  For your ease of reference, you are eligible to receive a booster:

At least 6 months after receiving your second Moderna vaccination.
At least 5 months after receiving your second Pfizer vaccination.
At least 2 months after receiving your single J&J vaccination.


Booster Clinics: As we did in the fall, the College will offer a number of COVID-19 Booster Clinics, prior to the February 1 deadline. The next booster clinic will be this Friday, January 7 (8 a.m. - noon). This clinic will offer the Moderna booster only. The Moderna booster is available to all, irrespective of which type of vaccine you received initially. Appointments are required and will be coordinated through Human Resources. Complete this form by 11 AM Wednesday (1/5/2022) to request an appointment for Friday. We are working to finalize additional booster clinic dates but we encourage you to get your booster on Friday or as early as possible if you are eligible. 
Updated Isolation Period: Per the most recent CDC guidelines, regardless of vaccination status, faculty and staff who have COVID-19 are required to isolate at home for a minimum of 5 days followed by 5 days of strict mask use (no eating or drinking near others) if they are asymptomatic or if their symptoms are resolving (and fever-free for 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medication). If symptoms are not improving, continued isolation will be required. Please do not come to campus if your symptoms are not resolving.
Quarantine for Close Contacts: 

Fully vaccinated employees (including the booster) who are not experiencing any symptoms do not need to quarantine if they are identified as a close contact of someone who tests positive for COVID-19. You must:

Practice strict mask wearing for 10 days after the exposure
Refrain from eating or drinking around others
Practice physical distancing

Individuals who are not fully vaccinated If you are identified as a close contact and you are unvaccinated or have completed the primary series of Moderna vaccine over 6 months ago, Pfizer over 5 months ago, or J&J more than 2 months ago and are not yet boosted, you are required to:

Quarantine for 5 days following exposure
Practice strict mask wearing for an additional 5 days
Refrain from eating or drinking around others
Practice physical distancing


In the event remote work is not possible during this period, sick leave will be charged for any absences from work.

Weekly Testing: All unvaccinated employees will continue to be tested weekly at the Health Center as we enter spring term 2022.
Masking: While we have not moved to a âredâ level, for the start of the spring semester, masks are required indoors and in all classroom settings, even when presenting/speaking (this is different from the fall term). For final performances and productions, at the discretion of the performance directors, performers may have the option not to wear a mask, as in the fall term. KN95 masks are highly recommended and two will be provided at the start of the term for all employees and students. Employees will also need to continue to have their own supply of masks.
Flu Vaccines: All students are required to be vaccinated for the flu before returning to campus; all employees are highly encouraged to also get vaccinated for the flu. 
Remote Work: Before the start of the 21-22 academic year, the College put in place clear guidelines for remote work (including online course instruction) in the case of personal or family illness or due to school or day-care closures. That policy is here along with other COVID-19 Policies and Resources. 
Eating and Drinking Together: Until further notice, we are encouraging all units to limit indoor events where food will be served (e.g. such as receptions, group meetings, etc.).

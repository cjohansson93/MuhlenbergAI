Tough Day for Other Women’s Teams


The Muhlenberg field hockey team put up a solid effort against Centennial Conference-leading Franklin & Marshall, which entered the week
ranked No. 2 in Division III.

The Mules lost 3-1, not bad considering that the Diplomats outscored their first six CC foes by a 26-2 margin, including a 5-1 win against top-10 Ursinus.

Junior Devon Barber scored Muhlenberg’s lone goal, her fourth of the year, late in the first half to cut F&M’s lead to 2-1.

Senior Brittany DeAngelis helped keep the Mules within striking distance by making three defensive saves, adding to the career record she set on
Wednesday against King’s. Freshman Heather Porrini also recorded a defensive save.

The women’s soccer team lost a key CC match vs. Franklin & Marshall, 1-0. The Diplomats scored the lone goal after stealing a pass
from a Mule back midway through the first half, and that stood up as the only score.

Muhlenberg (6-7-2, 3-3-1) dropped into seventh place in the CC with three games remaining.

Volleyball took a break from CC play and was swept in a tri-match by host Lebanon Valley and Stevenson, teams with a combined record of
42-8.

Next stop: the Centennial Conference Championships.

In their final competition before the CC meet, the Muhlenberg cross country teams raced against mostly Division I teams at the Leopard Invitational, hosted by Lafayette. The Mule


women placed sixth out of 12 teams, beating four Division I squads, while the men were eighth.

The women raced their top runners and had an excellent average 


time, one of the lowest in recent memory, for their top five – junior Samantha Mayden (15th),
sophomore Nicki Cronin (16th), junior Erica Bash (32nd), senior Melissa Ugelow (34th) and senior Kimberlee
Yalango (55th). Pictured are Bash (left) and Ugelow (right).



The men rested their top runner but still finished ahead of three teams from higher divisions. Freshman Kenny Wohl was the top finisher for the
Mules, coming in 36th.

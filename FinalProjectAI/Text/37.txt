 Deborah Ward '12 Majors: Russian Studies/Psychology Current: Ph.D. Student University of Buffalo
Since graduating from Muhlenberg, I have been working on my M.S. in Psychology at Villanova University. After completing my  Master's degree in the Spring of 2014, I will be entering the Ph.D. program in Social-Personality Psychology at the University of Buffalo, begining the Fall of 2014. My main research interests are self-concept and identity formation, which was largely sparked by my Russian Studies courses that focused on Russian culture and identity formation.

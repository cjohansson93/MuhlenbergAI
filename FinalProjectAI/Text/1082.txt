Weekly Community Update from President Harring
Tuesday, April 21, 2020

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
Normally, we would be deep into the busiest time of the year on campus. I remember as the semester began, I looked forward to taking part in all of the events and activities that usually accompany this time of yearâthe presentations, the performances, the athletic contests and the campus events that bring us together. I miss them all.
Preserving a sense of community as we move through the end of the semester has been an important concern for me and the rest of senior staff. I am so grateful to the staff members who are collaborating in pulling together virtual events to help us mark our accomplishments and the importance of community at Muhlenberg.
In my last message, I shared information about the rescheduling of commencement weekend and related activities. This week I am happy to tell you about the events we will be holding to mark the end of an extraordinary academic year. We will celebrate the achievements of our students, faculty and staff at Honors Convocation on May 2. An End of the Year Celebration for all students is scheduled for May 11 with live virtual events, an online platform and opportunities to participate through social media. Details are currently being finalized and will be shared soon.
Virtual Senior Days will take place from May 13-17 and include a pub night, Last Lecture, cap decorating, my year-end address and a class toast. Graduates in the School of Continuing Studies will receive information about events they can participate in during this week as well. All graduating students will receive a specially produced box that will contain their cap and gown, along with any earned academic cords and sashes, as well as a few extra items. Boxes will be mailed so that they should arrive before May 13. I hope all graduating students will participate in as much of the celebration as they can.
Another annual celebration at the College is the recognition of our faculty and staff. We are planning a virtual celebration for some time in May. The event will provide an opportunity to celebrate those faculty and staff whoâve earned institutional recognition and those who will be retiring at the close of this academic year.
Each week I am inviting questions to presquestions@muhlenberg.edu that I can answer via video in my next messageâhere is this weekâs video update:
 
When we review the questions you send, we look for themes so I can try and provide answers to some of the questions that many of you raise. If you have specific questions for a College office, please contact that office for a more detailed answer. Contact information for relevant offices can be found on the College website.
Please continue to stay safe and healthy. And thank you for all you are doing to keep the Muhlenberg community strong. 
Sincerely, Kathy HarringInterim President

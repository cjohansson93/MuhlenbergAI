Vila Homer in Ninth Keys Baseball Win at Dickinson
 Tuesday, April 23, 2013 - page 2







					 



After being held to four total runs in dropping its previous three games, the Muhlenberg baseball team broke out for nine runs against Dickinson.
And as it turned out, the Mules needed all of them.

Senior Joseph Vila hit a tie-breaking home run in the top of the ninth, and Muhlenberg held on for a wild 9-8 road win.

The Mules (18-17, 6-9) broke a 1-1 tie by scoring five runs in the sixth, the big blow a two-run double by junior Nick Kennedy.

Kennedy (left) singled in a run in the seventh for his fourth RBI of the game, giving the Mules a 7-3 lead, but the Red Devils (12-23, 3-12)
clawed back, scoring two runs in the seventh and two more in the eighth to tie the score.

Vila broke the tie with one out in the top of the ninth by hitting his third home run of the season and the 12th of his career. Muhlenberg
added another run later in the inning on a bases-loaded walk to freshman Andrew Rava.

That run proved to be important when Dickinson scored once in the bottom of the ninth. The game ended with the potential tying and winning 
runs on base.

Sophomores Tyler Latrenta and Jimmy Cody each went 3-for-5 with two runs scored. 

Senior John Muha
had an infield single in the fifth to tie the school record of 188 hits in a career. He is in position to become the Mules’ all-time hits
leader at home against Dickinson on Friday.

	 Thursday, August 28, 2014  11:28 AM

Barbara Cruikshank, associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, will kick off this year’s Center for Ethics programming with her talk, “Silencing Protest: On the Ethics and Politics of Social Theory,” on Tuesday, September 2, 2014 at 7:30 in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall.  This event is free and open to the public.
Cruikshank studies the history of reform, social movements, the politics of sex and sexuality, and relations of power and knowledge. She is the author of the forthcoming book Neopolitics: Activism, Reform, and the Practices of Freedom. 
Cruikshank’s talk is the opening event in the year-long Center for Ethics series, Civility and Disobedience, under the direction of Brian Mello, associate professor of political science, and Christine Sistare, professor of philosophy.
Each year, the Center for Ethics sponsors an intensive series designed to encourage discussion and reflection on a timely, pertinent topic.  Center for Ethics programs are free and open to all members of the Muhlenberg campus and the local community.

Baseball Finishes Season with Loss

The Muhlenberg baseball team finished its 2013 season with a 10-2 loss at DeSales.

The Mules (20-20) managed only four hits and scored both of their runs in the fourth on a hard smash up the middle by junior Nick Kennedy that
knocked the glove off the pitcher and an RBI single by sophomore Michael Giordano.

Sophomore Jimmy Cody stole second base in the inning (at right, going on to third on a throwing error by the catcher) and ended the season
with 12 steals. He combined with seniors John Muha (13) and Joseph Vila (12) to give Muhlenberg three players with double digits
in steals for only the third time in team history – the first since 2003.

The Bulldogs (30-10), who are receiving votes in the national Division III poll, broke a 2-2 tie with four runs in the sixth.

Senior Rob Shannon pitched the first six innings to become the eighth Mule hurler to throw 200 innings in his career. Senior Tim Velys
worked the eighth, striking out three of the five batters he faced.

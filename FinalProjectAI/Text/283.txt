Allergy Injections
Per the schedule established by the student’s allergist, allergy injections are administered by the Health Center nurses only during physician hours. Health Services does not administer the first injection from a new vial with new concentration; students will be referred to a local allergist appointment if they are unable to have this first injection administered by their own allergist. Students are responsible for picking-up their allergy serum and forms to take home over breaks when Health Services is closed. There is a fee of $2 per allergy injection administered, which is to be paid at time of injection.

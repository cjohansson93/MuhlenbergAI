men’s basketball drops 2008 opener


The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team should make a New Year’s resolution to start halves better.

In their first game of 2008, the Mules started slowly in both halves and lost at Moravian, 67-52. The result tied the Matte Award standings for
the 2007-08 school year at 5-5.

Down only 7-6 early on, Muhlenberg (5-6) went cold from the field for a seven-minute stretch and fell behind by 16 points, 24-8. The Mules recovered, though,
ending the half on an 11-0 run to go into the locker room down by only two points.

The zone defense that had held the Greyhounds (8-2) scoreless for the last 5:13 of the first half was less effective early in the second half. Moravian made four of 
its first five three-point tries in the second half, going on a 14-2 run to open up a 14-point lead.

This time there was no comeback, as Muhlenberg never found its shooting touch in the second half. The Greyhounds led by as many as 21 points and went on to their
seventh straight win.

Sophomore Ryan Foster led the Mules with 11 points, and junior Darrell Roth added nine.

Men’s soccer


two women’s teams want to play “mawr”


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer and volleyball teams, both chasing Centennial Conference playoff berths, won home contests they had to in order to remain in the hunt.
Soccer shut out Bryn Mawr, 3-0, while volleyball needed four sets to defeat Bryn Mawr.


Women’s soccer extended its winning streak against the Owls to 15 games, scoring all three goals in the first 24 minutes. In the third minute, an Owl defender

headed the ball right to junior Jennifer Lynch at the left post. She shot high to give the Mules (9-4-2, 4-2-1) an early lead. A second into the 12th minute, junior
Christina O’Grady converted a long pass from sophomore Emily Olson to make it 2-0. It was the first career point for Olson (right).

Freshman Nicolette Miller capped the scoring with her seventh goal of the season. She was assisted by junior Kasey Hacker, who made a nice run through the
Bryn Mawr defense.

With three games left in the season, 


Muhlenberg is in a pack of five teams separated by a point. Johns Hopkins (21 points), Swarthmore (16) and Ursinus (15) occupy the top
three positions, followed by Muhlenberg, Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall (all with 13), Gettysburg and Haverford (both with 12). The Mules’ three remaining games
are all against teams in playoff contention (F&M, Ursinus and Gettysburg).

Volleyball dropped the first set, 27-25, but came back to win the next three to beat Bryn Mawr for the ninth straight year.

The Mules led the second set, 20-17, before junior Brittany Williams scored three straight points, one on a kill and two on back-to-back aces. The Owls closed to
within 24-22, but a kill by freshman Jackie Price ended the set.

Muhlenberg (16-8, 4-3) had one run of eight points and another of seven points to easily win the third set, 25-8. Juniors Phylicia Lee and Liz Dean
recorded four kills apiece in the set.

Bryn Mawr jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the fourth set, but the Mules used a 9-2 run to take a 19-13 lead and went on to clinch the match with a 25-19 victory.

Lee led Muhlenberg with 12 kills, and freshman Davi Gordon added 10 with only one error. Williams and junior Christina Cangelosi (left) tied for the team lead
with 19 digs apiece, and senior Megan Eiser finished with 30 assists, 15 digs and seven kills.

The win lifted the Mules into a tie for the fifth and final playoff spot with Franklin & Marshall, their opponent in Saturday’s home finale. Muhlenberg also has
road matches against Ursinus and Gettysburg remaining; Gettysburg is in a three-way tie for first place.

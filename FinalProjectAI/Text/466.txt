What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators?Curated by Alastair Noble

Drift 1994, 17 min, colour, sound, 16mm [still] Chris Welsby
January 20 – February 20, 2016Artist Talk: January 27 4:30pm in the Martin Art GalleryOpening Reception: Wednesday January 20 4:30 – 6:30pm
The Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to present What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators? Curated by Alastair Noble. This multidisciplinary exhibition be on view January 20 through February 20, 2016 with a public reception occurring Wednesday, January 20, from 4:30 – 6:00 pm. Additionally, the public is invited to join us in the gallery for a talk featuring the curator, on Wednesday January 27, from 4:30 – 5:30pm.This exhibition presents six artists that are engaged in mapping through intensive research of either the land or sea or both but without conforming to any “conventional signs” other than those they have invented. In this case the artist’s tabula rasa transforms into a personal meditation on place, evoking both palpable and mythological sites presented through varied media.Works on display include US and international artists David Faithfull, Cathy Lane, Paul Martin, Brian Nissen, James Walsh and Chris Welsby, and the exhibition will be accompanied by a catalog and essay by the Curator.

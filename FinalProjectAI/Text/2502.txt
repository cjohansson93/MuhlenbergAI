Muhlenberg College was presented with a Certificate of Recognition from the Lehigh Valley Partnership for a Disability Friendly Community on Tuesday, September 23 on campus at the Hoffman House (325 North 23rd Street).  
Bob Wittman, chair of the Community Awareness Committee, says, “Muhlenberg has done an outstanding job helping students with disabilities succeed. The community has also derived great benefits from the College's actions on behalf of people with disabilities."
Dr. Nelvin Vos, the convener of the Partnership and emeritus professor of English, pointed to the College's academic resource center, the office of disability services and the department of theatre and dance as offices that do outstanding work on behalf of those with disabilities. Certificates will be awarded to each of these departments for their efforts, as well as to the College in general, for its commitment to being disability friendly.
The Lehigh Valley Partnership for a Disability Friendly Community has more than 75 members, including persons with disabilities, representatives from service provider agencies and organizations, caregivers, family members, government and community leaders as well as persons interested in advocacy for people with disabilities. 
The Certificate of Recognition is presented on an occasional basis to organizations that do an exemplary job promoting the benefits of inclusion and those organizations that are create a more disability-friendly environment. The Civic Theatre was the first recipient in May 2014.

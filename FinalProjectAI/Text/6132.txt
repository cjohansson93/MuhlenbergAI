Men's Basketball Falls to Ursinus on Late Basket
 Wednesday, January 18, 2012 - page 2







					 


The Ursinus men’s basketball team came back from a 14-point second half deficit and scored the final six points of the game to pull out a 63-61 win against Muhlenberg, spoiling a sensational night for sophomore Austin Curry and a milestone night for senior Spencer Liddic.

Curry scored a game-high 21 points on the strength of 6-of-9 shooting from behind the arc – oftentimes 




Curry’s previous high for three-pointers in a game was five against Franklin & Marshall last year.




way behind the arc. Liddic netted 14 points, becoming the sixth Mule and 19th player in Centennial Conference history to reach 1,500 points.

With one of their starters out and another ailing, the Mules played with a different lineup, but it didn’t seem to bother them at the start. Muhlenberg did not trail in the first half and took an 11-point lead, 36-25, into the locker room.

The bulge was at 14 (48-34) six minutes into the second half before the Bears (6-10, 5-4) began their comeback, eventually drawing even at 57-all with 5:11 left.

On the Mules’ next possession, after junior Hunter Forsman battled for an offensive rebound, Curry hit a deep three from the right wing and was fouled. He made the free throw to complete the four-point play, giving Muhlenberg a 61-57 lead with 4:28 to play. But those would be the last points the Mules (10-5, 4-5) scored.

Ursinus tied the score on four free throws and scored the winning basket on a jumper with 8.1 seconds left following a steal and an offensive rebound.

Muhlenberg rushed the ball up the court and took a three-pointer that hit iron, and the buzzer sounded in the scramble for the rebound.

The loss dropped the Mules into a four-way tied for fifth place at the halfway point of the CC season. Ursinus, which started out 0-3, is now in sole possession of fourth place.

Liddic hit the 1,500-point mark on a free throw with 8:37 remaining and finished the game with 1,502 points.

Forsman, making his second career start, pulled down 10 rebounds to go along with five points, three steals, two assists and a block.

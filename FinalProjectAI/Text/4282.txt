baseball drops pitching duel



The Muhlenberg baseball team suffered its third straight close loss to a 2010 NCAA Tournament team, falling to Penn State Behrend, 3-1.

In their last games, the Mules were swept by Alvernia, 4-2 and 4-3 in extra innings. Penn State Behrend won 31 games last year, including two in the NCAAs.

The loss to the Lions spoiled an outstanding pitching effort by senior Jason Daniels (left). The righty allowed only two earned runs and struck out eight in 8 2/3 innings.

Muhlenberg (2-7-1) put runners to third base in the first, third and fourth but did not send one home until the seventh, when junior Jesse Nusbaum walked, advanced to second on a wild pitch and came home on a two-out single by freshman John Scuderi.

That run made the score 2-1, but the Lions (4-3) used a bloop double to get the run back in the top of the ninth. The Mules attempted to rally in the bottom of the ninth, getting runners to first and third with one out, but the threat - and the game - ended on a double play.

Senior Bobby Spindler had two of Muhlenberg's seven hits. Senior catcher Clint Lynch picked off two runners, one from third and one from second.

Public Health Research
 
 Public Health students engage in research in a number of ways both on and off campus.  Students on campus work with faculty members on projects throughout the academic year and also in the summer.  Students who work on campus have the opportunity to join a faculty memberâs research group or may work on individual research projects mentored by the faculty member.  Our students present at local, regional, and national meetings, and are frequently listed as co-authors on papers published in scholarly journals.   In the summer, students have an opportunity to earn research support through the Public Health Summer Research Grant, which includes a stipend, room and board, and a credit. Public Health Summer Research Application.  In addition to on-campus research, students often engage in summer research off campus.   Students who engage in public health research experiences away from campus during the summer may earn credit with approval from the Public Health Program director.

daniels named player of the week


Junior Jason Daniels of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Daniels played 176 minutes in a 2-0 week for the Mules, making eight saves and only allowing one goal on a penalty kick. He turned away a career-high 
six shots vs. DeSales and extended his unscored-upon streak on the road to 418:21 by playing the first 86 minutes of a 4-0 win at Washington.

Daniels ranks fourth in the CC with a goals-against average of 0.75 and has allowed only three goals in the last eight games. His GAA in league games is 0.39.

The two wins improved Muhlenberg’s record to 8-3. The Mules are tied for first in the CC with Swarthmore, Johns Hopkins and Franklin & Marshall, all at 4-1.

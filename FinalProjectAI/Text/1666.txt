Ten Thousand Villages Fair Trade Market A Success 



For the third consecutive year, Muhlenberg College hosted the Ten Thousand Villages Fair Trade Market, which pays artisans a fair wage for their work. 


	 Saturday, December 3, 2005  01:59 PM

The sale profited more than $18,000 – the largest amount brought in for the organization at this location.
For 58 years, Ten Thousand Villages has worked with talented artisans around the world, providing vital, fair income for their beautiful handcrafted items. The Muhlenberg-hosted sale gave Lehigh Valley residents a chance to help artisans around the world feed, clothe and educate themselves and their families.

The craft items on sale included jewelry, holiday ornaments, children’s toys, folk art, ceramics, textiles, baskets for the home, exquisite jewelry, scarves (made from recycled silk) and other garments, musical instruments and many other items. A fair trade coffee sale in connection with the Fair Trade Market also took place.

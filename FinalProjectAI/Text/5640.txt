baseball hangs on to beat king’s


Taking the mound a day after the Muhlenberg pitching staff was peppered for 32 runs in a doubleheader loss to Wittenberg, Brent Morris had more on the agenda than just the King’s lineup.

Morris successfully played the role of stopper, throwing four scoreless 



Freshman Bobby Spindler steps on third to begin a 5-3 double play that got the Mules out of a minor jam in the fifth. It was one of three twin killings turned by Muhlenberg. Spindler also had two hits and scored two runs.



innings and allowing just two hits as the Mules snapped a three-game losing skid with a 13-9 win.

“Our staff had a bit of a meeting yesterday about how we wanted to step up and be leaders on this team,” said the junior southpaw. “I know some of the guys were looking to me, and I was able to keep their hitters off-balance by changing speeds. Hopefully we can turn things around.”

Although Morris didn’t work long enough to earn the win, he left with a 3-0 lead. He worked out of a bases-loaded, one out jam in the bottom of the first and recorded his only two strikeouts with a runner on third in the third. 

“I put myself in a little trouble with walks,” Morris said. “Coach came out [in the first inning] and told me to stay positive – that’s what we’ve been focusing on. Once he got in the dugout I located some fastballs and got out of it.”

The Mule batters located their balls all over the field, with a 15-hit attack that saw every starting player score at least one run. Muhlenberg led by 12-1 at one point before the Monarchs (2-3) made things interesting with a six-run eighth.

Sophomore Dan Fisher and junior Christian Conti led the attack with three RBI apiece, and Conti also scored three runs.

A booming triple to dead center by sophomore Eric Pomroy, sandwiched in between a single and infield error, gave the Mules a 2-0 lead in the second. 

Up 3-0, Muhlenberg broke the game open with six in the sixth after starting the inning with two outs and nobody on. Fisher’s two-run double, a double down the line by Conti and a two-run single by junior Edward Risener were the big hits.

Conti also hit a two-out, two-run triple as part of a three-run seventh inning – his fourth three-bagger in five games.

After King’s rallied to cut the margin to four runs, sophomore Mark Shive came in from the bullpen to get the final out of the eighth, then nailed down the win with a scoreless ninth.

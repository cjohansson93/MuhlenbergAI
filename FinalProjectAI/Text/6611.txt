Field Hockey Suffers First Loss


The Muhlenberg field hockey team suffered its first loss of the season, 2-0 to a strong Elizabethtown team that was coming off a season-opening win against 10th-ranked Franklin & Marshall.

Playing against an opponent to which it lost 5-0 last year, the Mules (1-1) trailed 1-0 for most of the game until the Blue Jays (2-0) converted a penalty stroke
with fewer than 20 minutes remaining.

Junior Ashley DeAngelis helped keep the score close by making three defensive saves, one short of the school record. Junior Mariah Alston
also recorded a defensive save.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team concluded its opening weekend of the season by splitting a pair of matches to finish second at the Greyhound Premiere Invitational.

In their first match of the day, the Mules defeated Wesley in four sets to move to 3-0 for the first time since 2005. Muhlenberg won the first set of the
championship match against Moravian but dropped the next three.

Freshman Katherine Boll was named to the all-tournament team. She hit .382 and averaged 2.62 kills per set in four tournament matches.

Sophomore Holly Hynson (right) put down 12 kills in the Wesley match and added 10 digs for her first career double-double.

Campus Community Message from the Health and Counseling Center and the Dean of Students Office
Friday, February 28, 2020

Dear students, faculty, and staff,
The risk level for COVID-19 (the Novel Coronavirus) within the United States remains low, but new cases are beginning to be reported in countries worldwide.  With the evolving developments of COVID-19 coupled with the anticipation of spring break, we wanted to share with you the following reminders and tips.
Travel Advisories
For those community members who are traveling, please regularly check the following resources for travel information:  CDC Travel Advisory Website and US Department of State Travel Advisory Information.   Please be aware that, at this time, the CDC has a Warning Level 3 recommending that travelers avoid nonessential travel to China and South Korea.  And there is an Alert Level 2 for Iran, Italy, and Japan. Restrictions can change without warning, and these changes could require a U.S. based quarantine or even affect the timing of your reentry to the country.  If you find yourself in this situation, please notify Muhlenberg College immediately by calling the Dean of Students Office (484-664-3182).
 
Prevention
As you enjoy your spring break, remember to take these simple everyday actions to prevent the spread of respiratory infections:


Avoid close contact with people who are sick.


Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.


Stay home when you are sick.


Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.


Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.


Follow CDCâs recommendations for using a facemask. 



CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.


Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. 



Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. 


If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.


 
Returning from Spring Break
If you were in a country with a COVID-19 outbreak and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing within 14 days after you have left, you should:  Seek immediate medical advice â Call ahead before you go to the emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms. Avoid contact with others.  And please notify the Dean of Students Office immediately (484-664-3182).
Regardless of your travel (if any) or COVID-19 concerns, if you are ready to return from spring break but are sick with flu-like symptoms, please postpose returning to campus until you are fever free for 24hours without the use of Advil or Tylenol.
Website Information
The College has established a COVID-19 information website that includes previous campus communications and links to information about COVID-19.  The college will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as warranted by changing circumstances.
We sincerely hope that you enjoy your spring break â relax, have fun, make responsible choices, and return re-energized for a strong and healthy finish for spring semester!

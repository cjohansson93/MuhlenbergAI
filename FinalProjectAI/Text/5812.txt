Golfers Fourth in Fall Opener



The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished fourth at the Wesley Invitational in its first competition of the 2007-08 school year.

Senior Garrett Carpenter and sophomore Biff Slocum led the Mules, each shooting a two-over-par 74. They tied for ninth in the 89-player field.

Muhlenberg sent the same five golfers to the tournament as it did last year and improved its team score by 10 strokes.

Foundational Courses 

101. History & Politics of American Education
This course examines the larger historical and sociopolitical forces that have shaped the rise and development of the institutional school in America. Beginning with Jeffersonian America through the late industrial period to the present day, the course traces changes in the political economy and how these changes have influenced educational policy and practice, such as rise of the common school and educational policy debates regarding the appropriate role of education in a democratic industrial and plural society. The course also addresses how schools interpret, translate, and transfer American culture through the overt and covert curriculum as well as public policy by studying the various conflicting aims of education in a democracy. The purpose of the course is to develop the studentsâ potential for thinking critically about American education and its institutions in preparation for ethical citizenship and/or educational leadership.
Meets general academic requirement SL.
 
104, 105. Educational Psychology: Child Learning & Development
This course reflects knowledge derived from theory, research, and professional practice as it covers the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development of infants and children (birth-9 years old) and the impact of this study for teaching and learning. In addition to classic developmental theorists (Piaget, Vygotsky, and Erikson among others), students will explore a variety of topics that impact the child as learner at these stages of development, including but not limited to attachment, brain development, memory, fantasy and the imagination, the arts as a way of knowing, play behavior, friendship, the development of empathy, early understandings of justice, the use of public and private space, transition from home to school, and children in relation to authority. Fieldwork is required.
Prerequisite(s): provisional admission to the program or permission of the instructor.
Meets general academic requirement SL (and W when offered as 105).
 
106, 107. Educational Psychology: Adolescent Learning & Development
This course reflects knowledge derived from theory, research, and professional practice as it covers cognitive, social, and personal development and the psychology of teaching and learning. We will use our classroom as an âexperimentâ in methods of teaching, learning, and educating ourselves about the sociopolitical contexts for development and learning in American classrooms. The focus of this course is on the developmental changes and challenges that occur approaching and during the adolescent years. We will explore both what is understood as âtypicalâ adolescent development as well as the ways in which individual adolescent experience may be unique. We will view the adolescent in a range of social contexts (e.g.,  family, peer group, school, culture) as we consider how issues of diversity (i.e., race, culture, class, gender, sexual identity) impact learning, and development. Fieldwork is required.
Prerequisite(s): Provisional admission to the program or permission of the instructor.
Meets general academic requirement SL (and W when offered as 107).
 
191, 192. The Arts in Education
In this course students will examine the arts as a way of perceiving the world, reflecting and challenging cultural norms, and expressing and learning new ideas.  Through a primarily studio experience, students will have an opportunity to engage in a variety of art forms (the visual arts, movement, music, and drama) as part of the process of learning an aesthetic language.  Recent advances in the field of neuroscience, psychology, education, and cultural studies help to illuminate both theory and practice.
Prerequisite(s): Provisional admission to the program or permission of the instructor.
Meets general academic requirement AR (and W when offered as 191).
 
201. Introduction to Special Education: Diverse Learners & Inclusive Classrooms
This course is designed to broaden knowledge and understanding about students with disabilities and how they develop and learn. Emphasis is placed on the roles and responsibilities of regular education teachers in meeting the needs of these students in order to create positive inclusive learning environments as informed by relevant research. The course introduces the preservice teachers to topics including health impairments, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, ADHD, emotional disturbance, autism, sensory impairments, physical disabilities, and giftedness. These topics are examined from the perspective of causation, diagnosis, cognitive and social-emotional characteristics, learning styles, early intervention, and differentiated instructional strategies with a focus on meeting the needs of students in the context of the regular classroom. The role of the regular classroom teacher in the referral/evaluation process and working with appropriate school personnel and families is emphasized. Also examined are multicultural and bilingual issues as they pertain to special education. Fieldwork is required.
Prerequisite(s): Provisional admission to the program or permission of the instructor.
Meets general academic requirement SL.
 
202. Introduction to Early Childhood Education

211, 212. Inclusive Education for Emergent Bilingual Students
The purpose of this course is to prepare preservice teachers to create equitable learning environments for emergent bilingual students (often referred to as English learners) in preK-12 school settings. In doing so, the course content is approached from a transformative paradigm, where we engage in analysis of school systems, program, and instructional approaches for emergent bilinguals and critique the ways in which schools and teachers maintain linguistic hierarchies. In doing so the course draws from the research on instructional design and assessment, applied linguistics and second language acquisition, sociology of language, and anthropology of (language) education. Topics covered include linguistic racism, language ideologies, culturally sustaining pedagogy, translanguaging pedagogy, co-teaching and sheltered instruction, and integrated language and content instruction. Students will be expected to develop theoretical knowledge as well as demonstrate practical skills through analyzing, planning, and delivering lessons. Twenty hours of fieldwork in a K-12 school are required.

The relationship between language acquisition and reading and writing processes are explored through the emergent literacy perspective. Topics in early literacy development include print awareness, phonemic/phonological awareness, phonics instruction, decoding and oral reading fluency, and developmental writing. These theoretical backgrounds inform various instructional approaches to early literacy instruction such as constructivism/whole language, balanced literacy program, and guided reading. This course also offers an overview of childrenâs literature, including an introduction to the genres, notable books and authors, and resources for incorporating childrenâs literature in literacy education programs.

Student teaching is the core component of the professional semester. As interns in the public schools, students have the opportunity to apply the content knowledge and pedagogical skills gained in their academic preparation to actual classroom situations. Lesson and unit planning as well as assessment and classroom management skills are honed with the support of a mentor teacher and a college supervisor. Daily seminars prior to student teaching focus on differentiated instruction, questioning strategies, lesson planning, meeting the needs of a diverse public school population, and strategies to enhance student motivation. Weekly seminar sessions during the semester provide the student teachers with a forum to reflect analytically on their classroom experiences as they develop their professional skills and voice. This semester consists of two full-time teaching experiences in grade levels appropriate to the area of certification.

more the merrier formen's cross country 








A bigger field meant greater opportunity for the Muhlenberg mens cross country team when it opened its season at the Lehigh Invitational.

The event was formerly run as the Lehigh Valley Championships and included only local schools Lehigh, Lafayette, Muhlenberg, Moravian, DeSales, Kutztown and East Stroudsburg. The field was expanded and the name changed this year with the addition of two other Division I schools, Navy (women only) and Rider, and one more Division III squad, Widener (men only).

The Mule men came in third out of eight teams, trailing only two Division I opponents. Muhlenberg beat one Division I school, Lafayette.

In the 10-year history of the event, the Mules placed better only once, in 2007, when they came in second to Lehigh. So this result matched their best showing ever against the Lehigh Valley schools.

For the first time in the meets history, Muhlenberg placed three runners in the top 20. Senior Bobby Torphy placed in the top 10 for the second year in a row, coming in seventh to six Division I athletes. Sophomore Brendan Smith had the best race of his career, finishing 12th (third among Division III runners), and freshman Bobby McGetrick crossed the line in 18th place in his collegiate debut.

The women were seventh out of nine teams, led by senior Kim Bier in 40th place.

Sophomore Samantha Mayden (right) was the second member of the Muhlenberg women's team to cross the line. She knocked 75 seconds off her time on the same course at the final meet of the 2009 season.

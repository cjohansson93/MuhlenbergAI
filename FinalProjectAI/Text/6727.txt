Women's Basketball Posts Flavorful Win vs. Haverford
 Wednesday, February 13, 2013







					 

 Men’s basketball


Haverford may have had [Rachel] Baskin and [Brianna] Robbins on its women’s basketball team, but it was Muhlenberg that had the “31-derful” player.




Clawson is 48-for-52 (92.3 percent) from the line this season.



Following a scuffle for the ball, sophomore Nicole Pepe, who wears jersey No. 31, banked in a three-pointer as the shot clock expired to give the Mules a 58-53 edge over the Fords with 1:19 remaining in the game. Her shot ended up being the “cherry on top” as Muhlenberg went on to defeat Haverford, 68-59, and hold on to sole possession of third place in the Centennial Conference.

The Mules (16-8, 13-6) are a half game ahead of Johns Hopkins, which finished CC play with a 13-7 league mark. Muhlenberg needs to beat Ursinus in Saturday’s regular-season finale to earn a first-round playoff bye.

“I think we deserved it after those two other ones at Swarthmore and F&M,” said senior Kate Clawson of the banked-in three. In those two games, the Mules’ opponents banked in threes at the final buzzer – once to win and once to send the game into overtime.

Although Pepe finished with 12 points on 4-for-8 shooting from behind the arc, it was Clawson who iced the win for the Mules, going 6-for-6 from the line in the final 46.5 seconds of the game.




Junior Leeann Lanza pulled down eight rebounds and was involved in one of the strangest plays of the game. With 8:39 left, she was fouled while shooting and given an "and-one" opportunity even
though her shot did not go in.


She finished with a career-high 23 points on 5-of-10 shooting from the field and a perfect 10-for-10 from the charity stripe. She also hit a career mark with her nine rebounds.

“I do the same routine every time and just take a deep breath,” said Clawson of her foul shooting. “I like shooting free throws, so I just go to the line and tell myself to knock them down.”

Although the Mules had an eight-point advantage at the half, Haverford whittled away at the lead and went up by two on a three-pointer with 4:23 remaining.

That’s when Clawson kicked it into gear.

She hit a three-pointer from the left corner on the Mules’ next possession, assisted by sophomore Hannah Rush. Haverford answered with a runner to regain the lead but the next time down the court, Rush found Clawson for another three to put Muhlenberg back up by two, 55-53, with 3:21 to play.

“I think when anyone hits a big shot like that, it gives the whole team confidence to come down the court, get a stop on D and then hit another shot,” stated Clawson. “The last couple of weeks we have really come into our own with our shooting and that’s been really good for us.”

Rush finished with five assists and four points, and senior Alita Zabrecky added four assists to go along with 16 points and two blocks.

Clawson’s three treys bring her career total to 67, good for 11th place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

“It feels really good to have hit a career high tonight,” added Clawson. “I don’t go into games expecting anything like this, but I know it’s the end of the season and I’m a senior, so I just have to give it my all.

“As a team, we’re trying to go into every game and just have fun because we play well when we are relaxed and having fun.”

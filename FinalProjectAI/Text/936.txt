Health Professions Clubs and Organizations
At Muhlenberg youâll find countless ways to engage in health professions outside the classroom or laboratoryâincluding honors societies, clubs and opportunities for community engagement.
Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is the national honor society for students who plan to enter the health professions. Student must have completed at least three semesters of pre-health coursework with at least a 3.2 GPA (overall and BCPM). The club meets biweekly and all students are invited to attend their programs and participate in service projects. Initiation typically occurs each spring semester.
Muhlenberg's Pre-Dental Club brings together motivated students planning to attend dental school. Members are aspiring dentists, orthodontists, periodontists and oral surgeons. The group meets to prepare as thoroughly as possible for the DAT exam and the dental school application/interview process by sharing study strategies, hosting current dental students and professionals in oral healthcare and participating in service throughout the semester. Their largest service opportunity takes place at elementary schools in the Allentown School District, where they host seminars about proper oral hygiene and brushing technique.
Pre Vet Club is small but comprised of like-minded students motivated in taking the necessary (and fun!) steps in getting to vet school. We aim to explore the different fields of animals medicine: small animal science, large animal, exotic, animal behavior etc, all while supporting the community in animal welfare, for example through the shelters we are involved with. We are a flexible and welcoming club where everyone's ideas and concerns are heard and respected.
Pre-Occupational Therapy Club (Pre-OT) is a small group of students who work together to make sure all students are on track to apply for occupational therapy graduate programs. The club has a mentorship program for students to discuss questions about the field of occupational therapy. We also bring in occupational therapists to speak to students so that they can learn about the various settings in which occupational therapists practice (geriatrics, pediatrics, hand therapy, traumatic brain injury, schools, hospitals, etc). We present journals, articles, and research related to occupational therapy so that we can deepen our knowledge. 
Minority Pre-Health Society (MPHS) at Muhlenberg brings together students who are from populations who are underrepresented in the health professions. This club is for minority students interested in a variety of health-related careers, including but not limited to medicine, dentistry, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, health care administration, entrepreneurship, and social work. The MPHS aims to improve minority matriculation into all pre-health professions by providing information and resources to group members, inviting alumni and local health professionals to speak to the club, and providing a safe space for students to share their experiences as pre-health students. The club also seeks to inform the wider Muhlenberg community of the importance of increasing the numbers of minorities in medicine and other health professions.

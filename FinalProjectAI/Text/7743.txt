Men's Golf Opens Year with Tournament Win

The Muhlenberg men’s golf team opened its 2014-15 season with a splash, winning the Moravian Fall Invitational by nine strokes over Messiah.

The tournament title was the first for the Mules since they won at Moravian in the spring of 2011. The margin of victory was their fifth-highest in a one-day tournament since 2000. 



Muhlenberg hadn’t started the year with a tournament win since taking the title at the Gettysburg Invitational in the fall of 1999.

The Mules were bolstered by a pair freshman who had similarly dazzling debuts. Evan Overcash (left) tied for second with a 3-over-par 75, one stroke off the lead. Overcash shot three birdies, including a 2 on the 197-yard eighth hole, in recording the lowest score by a Muhlenberg freshman in the first round of the year since 2010.

Classmate Daniel Eidman was a stroke behind at 76. 

Sophomore John Froberg carded a 77, matching his low round of last year and giving the Mules three of the 11 golfers who were within five strokes of par. Sophomore David Barkley also broke 80, shooting a 79.

Men's Soccer Shuts Out Washington Behind Chojnowski, Way
 Sunday, October 9, 2011







					 


Different goalie, same result.

Sophomore Jas Chojnowski recorded a shutout in his first career start as the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team won at Washington, 1-0.




Way's goal was the 20th of his career.


Junior Danny Way scored the game’s lone goal, his fifth of the season, in the 19th minute.

Chojnowski, who made six saves, saw his first career varsity minutes on Wednesday in a scoreless tie with New Jersey. He came in at halftime after Ari Nutovits, who started the first nine games of the season, was injured in the first half. Nutovits recorded five shutouts in his first eight starts.

It’s the first time since 2003 that the Mules have had two different goalies start and record shutouts. Chojnowski is the first Muhlenberg goalie to notch a shutout in his first career start since 2001.

No matter who’s in goal, Muhlenberg has opened the season with seven shutouts in its first 



Men’s Golf 12th at McDaniel


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team finished 12th at the Mason-Dixon Collegiate Classic, hosted by McDaniel.

Senior Zack Meyers led the Mules in the two-day event by shooting a 158, one stroke better than sophomore Christopher Lucarelli.

10 games – something it hadn’t done since 1990.
 
Chojnowski had little margin for error in his shutout, and on a day that offered more evidence as to the strength of the Centennial Conference in men’s soccer, the Mules (7-2-1, 3-2) gladly took the one-goal win against the Shoremen (3-6-2, 1-3-1), to whom they have lost only once.

Two of the other regionally ranked teams in the CC were tested by teams that came in winless. Dickinson fell victim to Haverford, 3-2, while Franklin & Marshall trailed at halftime before coming back for a 4-1 win against McDaniel. Muhlenberg is in a three-way tie for fourth in the CC with Dickinson and F&M.

The game’s lone score came when sophomore Jacob Joseph sent a cross ahead to Way, who sent a shot into the opposite corner of the goal, past the diving Washington keeper.

The Mules put three other shots past the goalie, but all were cleared out of the goal by a defender. The Shoremen rang a shot off the crossbar in the 88th minute, and Chojnowski saved a header off the rebound to preserve the 1-0 lead.

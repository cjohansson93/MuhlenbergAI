early goal dooms women’s soccer


After playing 110 minutes without a score in its opener against St. Joseph's, the Muhlenberg women's soccer team found itself in an immediate hole on the second day of the Kean Classic, as the host school scored on a breakaway just 38 seconds into the contest.

The Mules fell behind 2-0 later in the first half, but they have a history of dramatic comebacks at the Kean Classic. In 2008, they erased a 2-1 deficit by scoring three times in the last 7:22 to beat Kean, 4-2, and in 2006, they netted three goals in the last 14:25 to overcome Gwynedd-Mercy, 3-2.

This time, however, Muhlenberg came up short, losing 3-2. The Mules cut a two-goal deficit in half twice on goals by juniors Meghan O'Grady and Nicolette Miller but could not score the equalizer. 

Freshman CJ Graetzer (right) assisted on the first goal for her first career point.

Honors Thesis in Religion Studies
This project is designed for religion studies majors who have consistently proven to be excellent students. It offers them the opportunity to pursue a self-designed major research and analysis thesis, in close consultation with a faculty member. 
The project will normally be undertaken in either semester of the Senior year. Students who wish to complete the honors thesis in religion studies must have a 3.5 grade point average in departmental courses and a 3.3 grade point average overall. 
A written proposal for this project must be approved by a faculty member in religion studies in the semester prior to the one in which the thesis will be completed. The proposal must consist of a working thesis, a detailed description of the project, and a tentative bibliography. 
The culmination of the project will be a presentation for faculty and students at the end of the term. Department faculty will determine whether Honors will be awarded upon completion of the thesis.

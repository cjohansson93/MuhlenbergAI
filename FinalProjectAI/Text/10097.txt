Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is a national honor society and service organization dedicated to the encouragement and recognition of excellence in pre-professional health scholarship. Membership is based on each student's scholastic achievement, and applications are open to all students who have completed at least three semesters of a preprofessional health program.
Susan Medalie '10, a family medicine and obstetrics physician, addressed the AED class of 2022 during the ceremony. Medalie graduated from Muhlenberg with a major in neuroscience. She earned her medical degree from West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine and completed her residency in family practice from Good Samaritan Hospital of Pennsylvania. Beginning in May, she will be the Director of Family Medicine Obstetrics for Lehigh Valley Health Networkâs Schuylkill Rural Family Medicine Residency in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.

Soccer playoff schedules set



Hoffman Named Player of the Week



Junior Samantha Hoffman of the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team was named Centennial Conference defensive player of the week for the second time in her career.

Hoffman, playing sweeper, anchored a defense that produced shutouts of Ursinus and Gettysburg in a 1-0-1 week that clinched a playoff berth for the Mules. Muhlenberg allowed only five shots on goal in 200 minutes in the two matches.

The Mules have recorded nine shutouts this season, the most since the 2001 squad blanked a school-record 12 opponents.




Both Muhlenberg soccer teams qualified for the Centennial Conference playoffs and will begin postseason play on Wednesday.

The women (10-4-4, 5-2-3) are the fourth seed and will host fifth-seeded Haverford (8-9-1, 5-4-1) on Wednesday at 7:00. The winner will go on to play the top seed, nationally ranked and undefeated Johns Hopkins, in one semifinal on Saturday. The second semifinal pairs Dickinson against Swarthmore, with the final set for Sunday. Muhlenberg won the regular-season meeting with Haverford, 2-0.

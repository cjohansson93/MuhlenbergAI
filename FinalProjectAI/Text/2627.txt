aitkens named player of the week





Aitkens had two of Muhlenberg’s four interceptions against Johns Hopkins. Junior Matt Rathbun (27) returned the first one 59 yards for a touchdown, thanks to a 
crushing block by senior Chris Swensen (left).



Sophomore Dan Aitkens of the Muhlenberg football team was named co-defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Aitkens recorded a career-high 10 tackles and was responsible for three turnovers – two in the last five minutes – in the Mules’ 28-21 win against Johns Hopkins. He halted a potential game-tying drive by the Blue Jays by picking off a pass at the Muhlenberg 40-yard line with 4:38 left, then recovered a fumbled punt with 1:32 on the clock to clinch the game.

Aitkens also picked off a pass in the second quarter, returning it 35 yards, and pressured the Hopkins quarterback into an intentional grounding penalty in the third quarter.

For the season, Aitkens is tied for the CC lead with three interceptions, all in the last two weeks. He is tied for second on the 4-0 Mules with 25 tackles, including 3½ for loss, and has recovered two fumbles.

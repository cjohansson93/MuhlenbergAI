The End of the Sports Section: How Sports Blogs andthe Internet are Ending an Era of Sports Journalism
Sports journalism is being changed on many different levels because ofblogging. This project examines these changes, and their implicationsfor the future of sports news distribution. To illustrate the impact ofblogs, three case studies are explored that display the most prominentways blogs are changing sports journalism. The first case follows thecoverage of NFL quarterback Matt Leinhartâs off-season activities andprovides an example of blogs changing the types of stories covered bythe mainstream media. In the second case study, a traditional main-stream story was broken by an Internet blog. This occurrence startedthe blogâs integration into mainstream media. The final case studyshows a blog acting as a âwatchdogâ of the mainstream sports mediaand negatively impacting public perception of traditional journalists.Previous research on the relationship of journalism to blogging has ex-pressed hope about these changes having a positive impact on newscoverage. While the case studies cannot entirely confirm that hope, theydo display encouraging trends on how sports are being presented tofans.

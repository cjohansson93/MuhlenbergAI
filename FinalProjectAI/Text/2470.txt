Muhlenberg's Public Health curriculum extends across the natural sciences, mathematics, social sciences and humanities to educate and empower students about health-related issues from varying points of view.
Students who major in Public Health will gain an understanding of behavioral, economic, historical, political and social determinants of health, and of the important relationships that statistics and science have on the design of public health interventions. The core class, Issues in Public Health, is designed to introduce students to a wide variety of public health topics including historical perspectives, epidemiological principles and health intervention practices, health promotion and health communication and global issues of health.
The major prepares students for graduate work and professional careers in public health. Students are encouraged to participate in public health related experiences including independent research study, service learning or other experiential learning connected to a course, internships within the community and community service unconnected to a course. The minor offers students flexibility to choose electives appropriate to their interests in public health that also compliment their respective majors.
Public Health Research
In the summer, students have an opportunity to earn research support through the Public Health Summer Research Grant, which includes a stipend, room and board, and a credit.

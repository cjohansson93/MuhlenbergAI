Two named player of the week 





Senior Matthew Schroeder of the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team and junior Ashley Brewer of the softball team were honored by the Centennial Conference.




Schroeder (left) was named defensive player of the week after leading a defense that allowed just three even-strength goals in a 7-6 overtime win over Washington  the Mules first-ever victory against the Shoremen. He recorded four ground balls and one caused turnover as Muhlenberg held Washington under 11 goals for the first time in eight meetings.

Schroeder and the Mule defense have been fantastic in the first four games of 2010. The Mules are allowing just 6.75 goals per game and are causing 11.50 turnovers per game, the second-best mark in the CC. Schroeder is currently fifth in the conference in ground balls per game with 4.50.

Brewer (right) was selected as co-pitcher of the week after a pair of complete-game wins against Lesley and Northwestern (Minn.). She tossed a three-hit shutout against Lesley, recording 12 of the 15 outs herself either by strikeout (seven with no walks) or ground ball back to her. 

Brewer threw another three-hitter against Northwestern, allowing just one run and striking out a career-high 11. She also starred at the plate, belting a two-run home run and knocking in another.

In four starts so far this season Brewer is 3-1 with a 2.47 ERA and 32 strikeouts. Opponents are hitting just .169 against her. She is also Muhlenbergs leading hitter with a .579 batting average, 11 hits, two home runs, eight RBI and six stolen bases  all team highs.

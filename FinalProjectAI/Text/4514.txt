Cross country teams finish sixth 



Women’s Soccer, Volleyball Seasons End at Gettysburg


Needing a win or a tie to qualify for the Centennial Conference playoffs, the Muhlenberg women's soccer team fell at Gettysburg, 3-0, in the last game of the season.

The Bullets (12-6, 7-3) earned the fourth seed in the CC playoffs. The Mules (7-8-2, 6-4) finished in a tie for fifth with Ursinus and Swarthmore but were eliminated because they lost to both of those teams. Despite not making the playoffs, Muhlenberg defeated two teams (second seed Johns Hopkins and third seed Haverford) that did.

One year after defeating Gettysburg in its last regular-season match to clinch a Centennial Conference playoff berth, a very different Muhlenberg volleyball team lost in four sets to the Bullets.

The Mules finished the season 6-21 overall, with four wins in their final six matches. The lone losses in that stretch were to CC playoff teams.

Junior Davi Gordon hit .500, recording 10 kills without an error in 20 attempts.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams both finished sixth at the Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by Johns Hopkins at Belmont Conference Center in Elkridge, Md.

The women improved their standing from last year by one place, finishing as high as sixth for the first time since 2006.

For the first time since 1999, the Mule women placed two runners in the top 20. Freshman Nicole Cronin came in 17th, two places ahead of sophomore Samantha Mayden.

The best overall finisher for Muhlenberg was men's senior Bobby Torphy, who was 12th. It was the best career finish for Torphy (left), who was 37th as a freshman, 30th in 2008 and 27th last year. Senior Ryan Wilson was 32nd.

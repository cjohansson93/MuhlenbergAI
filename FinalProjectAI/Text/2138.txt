Information and resources directly related to current Muhlenberg Biology students may be found to the right. Students are encouraged to take advantage of all the Biology department and Muhlenberg offer in regards to career and research opportunities, graduate school and medical school counseling, obtaining recommendations, building services, work-study positions , and much more.

Students interested in combining their biology degree with an education degree to later teach at the high school, junior high school, or elementary education level can obtain a teaching certificate in addition to their Biology degree. If this possibility is of interest to you, please talk with Drs. Iyengar or Byrne. There are many requirements for teaching certification, so it is a good idea to discuss your possible interest with either of these faculty as soon as possible.

Track and Field Teams Shine at Home Meet
 Saturday, April 7, 2012 - page 2







					 





Sophomore Jarrett Felix broke two minutes in the 800 meters for the first time, coming in seventh at 1:59.62.



It was a good day weather-wise and a good day performance-wise when the Muhlenberg track and field teams hosted the 13th Muhlenberg Invitational.

Breezy, chilly conditions in the morning gave way to bright sunshine in the afternoon, and it was a sunny day for the Mules in their second meet of the outdoor season.




Sophomores Amber Lee Wojtkowski (left) and Stephanie Carnevale (right) both qualified for the final in the 100-meter hurdles, coming in seventh and fifth,
respectively.




Muhlenberg had three first-place finishes, all on the women’s side. Junior Samantha Mayden garnered two of them, capturing the 1,500 meters and running the third leg of the 4x800-meter relay team. Mayden won the 1,500 by nine seconds over teammate Nicki Cronin, who was 12 seconds ahead of the third-place runner.

The third first-place finish was by junior Tara Keegan, who won the javelin with a personal-best throw of 115-0 on her final attempt.

Senior Peter Rice had two second-place finishes for the men, in the 200 and 400, and sophomore Bobby McGetrick was second in the steeple.

Junior Erica Bash ran a personal best to place second in the 800. Sophomore Erin Saucier tied her personal best in the pole vault, finishing third, and beat her previous best in the discus by almost seven to feet to come in fourth.

Freshman Malique Killing, jumping for the first time at Muhlenberg, came in fifth in the long jump and landed at No. 5 on the all-time performance list.

Background:
Dr. Herrickâs areas of study include comparative politics, international relations, and environmental policy.  Dr. Herrickâs research focuses generally on foreign and national security policies.  His current research focuses upon Chinaâs âPeaceful Riseâ and  examines the prospects that despite potential economic compatibilities perceptions and misperceptions will negatively affect Chinaâs relations with the United States, India, Japan, Southeast Asia and Africa. He has also published a book on Issues in U.S. Foreign Policy.
Together with Ms. Nancy Collings, the Mandarin Instructor at Muhlenberg, Dr. Herrick has designed and conducted a Muhlenberg Integrated Learning Abroad (MILA) course that addresses sustainable development in China and includes a two week travel experience in the Pearl River Delta region of China. 
Dr. Herrick is also the faculty advisor for a number of prestigious post-graduate awards. These include the Boren, Fulbright, Gates Cambridge, Jackson-Davies, Marshall, and Rhodes Scholarships

Accessing Online Resources



Library Home|Online Resources|Accessing Online Resources






Trexler Library provides access to a variety of online resources including eBooks, journal articles, videos, music, and other types of content. Most resources are available both on-campus and off-campus.
Finding Online Resources
Online resources can be found by searching the libraryâs online catalog, Encompass; selecting a specific collection directly through the Databases A-Z list; or linking from within a subject guide or Canvas course.
Using Encompass to find online books, articles, videos, and other formats
When using Encompass, start in Advanced Search. Set the Format (under Search Tools) to âOnline content and media.â Add your Search Terms at the top of the screen and click Search. On the search results screen, you can add more filters.

Under âHeld By Libraryâ check âMuhlenberg College Trexler Library if you only want items that are immediately available to you. 

Note: You may request eJournal articles and eBook chapters from other libraries through Interlibrary Loan but not eBooks, eJournals, eVideos, or other media. 

Under âFormats,â you can further limit the types of formats shown in your search results by using the checkboxes to choose what you want to keep.

If you find an eBook chapter or journal article that Trexler Library does not own, you may request it through Interlibrary Loan. 
For more information about filtering, see the Encompass subject guide.
For more information about using eBooks, see the eBooks subject guide.
Video, music, and other formats
When searching for online audiovisual content, use the filters on the left of the search results to limit to Held by Muhlenberg College Trexler Library and select the âeâ formats of interest to you. The library usually cannot loan electronic media from other libraries. To avoid seeing many search results for items you cannot obtain, it is best to limit your results to âHeld by Muhlenberg College Trexler Library.â
 
Linking Errors
If you encounter a broken link from within Encompass, you can click on Report a Broken Link which is available in the full record view. In the full record view, scroll down and open the âAccess Onlineâ section (example). Alternatively, you may report the issue using the Report a Broken Link form.
Off-Campus Access
If you are off-campus and click on a link to access a resource, you will be asked for your Muhlenberg network login and password in order to gain access. A few resources have special account requirements. In those cases, you will be given further instruction. Please see the Off-Campus Access page for additional help logging in to resources from off-campus.

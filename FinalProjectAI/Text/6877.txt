Baseball Gains Split on Rosen Walkoff Homer

What was for the most part a gloomy day for the Muhlenberg baseball team had a rosy ending.

More precisely, a Ros-en ending.




Rosen is hitting .363 and is tied for the team lead with 24 RBI.



Junior Brett Rosen hit a walkoff three-run pinch-hit home run in the bottom of the ninth to lift the Mules to a 7-5 win over Franklin & Marshall in the second game of a doubleheader. The Diplomats used some ninth-inning magic of their own to take the first game, 6-3.

Muhlenberg (15-13, 3-6) was three outs away from a win in the opener thanks to a long RBI double off the base of the fence by sophomore Danny Usewick in the bottom of the eighth. But F&M (14-14, 5-4) scored four times in the top of the ninth to hand the Mules their fifth straight loss.

The nine innings after the Diplomats’ rally will not find their way onto the highlight video for the Muhlenberg batters. The Mules went down 1-2-3 in five of the innings and managed just four hits and one gift run, on a wild throw on senior Joseph Vila’s steal of third in the first inning of the nightcap.

F&M scored four times in the top of the seventh to take a 5-1 lead, which it carried into the bottom of the ninth. Vila led off the inning with an infield single and went to second when sophomore Nick Plinio was hit by a pitch.

Junior Nick Kennedy hit a hard single off the glove of the diving shortstop, and sophomore Kurt Johnson followed with a line single to left that was misplayed, bringing in Plinio to make it 5-3.

The next batter, junior John Scuderi was safe on a throwing error that plated Kennedy. That set the stage for Rosen, who hit the Mules’ first walkoff home run in two years.

The comeback was reminiscent of one earlier this year against Penn State Behrend, in which seven straight batters reached base to start a five-run bottom of the ninth for a 7-6 win. In the F&M game, the first six batters reached, and all scored for a 7-5 victory.

Sophomore Austin Cush worked a 1-2-3 top of the ninth to pick up his first win of the season. The Mules received excellent pitching from both of their starters. Senior Rob Shannon pitched into the ninth in the opener, and sophomore Matthew Lawsky allowed only two runs in six innings while striking out six in the nightcap.

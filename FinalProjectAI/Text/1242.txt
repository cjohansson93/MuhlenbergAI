Education
B.A., Amherst College M.S., Ph.D., Cornell University
Professional background
After graduating with my PhD in 2006, I moved to Atlanta where I taught one year at Georgia State University and then three years at Morehouse College.
Teaching
I have taught a variety of courses at Muhlenberg including Topics in Mathematics, Statistical Methods, Fundamentals of Mathematics, Statistical Analysis, Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, Transition to Abstract Mathematics, Operations Research, Mathematical Analysis, Complex Variables, Mathematical Economics, and Auction Theory.
Academic Interests
My general area of interest is analysis. My PhD thesis was in Yang-Mills Theory which includes aspects of analysis as well as differential geometry. I am currently working on projects in functional analysis as well as in auction theory.
I am also interested in working with students on independent reading and research projects. In particular I am interested in working on new research in auction theory.  In the past I have worked with students on projects on optimally submitting Best Offers on eBay and on how prospect theory can affect optimal strategies on so-called "penny auctions.''  I have other ideas for future student collaborations.  If you are a prospective or current Muhlenberg student interested in auction theory, please don't hesitate to contact me.

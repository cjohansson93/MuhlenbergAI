Season Preview

BASEBALL SEEKS PLAYOFF RETURN 


When the Muhlenberg baseball team arrives in the legendary Dodgertown complex, the former spring training home of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, for spring break, it will be surrounded by history, playing in the same facilities that were once home to Sandy Koufax, Jackie Robinson and Duke Snider.

After missing out on a second straight berth in the Centennial Conference playoffs last season, in large part due to losing eight games by one run or in extra innings, the Mules will also look to make 2009 history in 2010.





With 16 career wins, Cresta is just five shy of the school record. He also needs just 36 innings to take over as the leader in innings pitched.



“Our goals are the same as always: have a successful trip down to Florida, have a strong non-conference and conference season, make the playoffs and compete for the conference crown,” said senior Mark Shive.

Muhlenberg’s drive for the conference crown may very well hinge on its ability to come up with the big play late in games, whether at the plate, on the mound or in the field, to win the tight ones.

“A lot of it is just focusing on the little things,” said Shive. “We can’t make the little errors that turn one- or two-run innings into big innings. And if we have a lead late in the game we need to get the extra runs on offense.”

Plenty of new faces will be providing those runs on offense. The Mules return just three full-time position players from a year ago, all in the infield. Senior Dan Fisher returns at shortstop, where he batted .340, led the team in hits (49) and runs scored (35) and set a school record with 14 doubles.

His double-play partner will once again be senior second baseman Eric Pomroy, who hit .331 and tied for the team lead in RBI with 30. Junior third baseman Bobby Spindler is back at the hot corner after recording 29 hits and knocking in 12 runs.

Juniors Eli Branzburg (.306) and Clint Lynch (seven doubles) will share time at catcher again.




Another 35-run season would put Fisher second all-time at Muhlenberg in runs scored; he is currently 12th.






Junior Joseph DiCecilia is healthy again after playing only one game last year and will start at first base; as a freshman he hit .316 and had 15 RBI, mostly off the bench. 

Sophomore Nick Busillo will compete to start at designated hitter. Busillo played well as a rookie in limited action, belting 13 hits, five of which went for extra bases, in just 28 at-bats.

Junior Jeff Puklin (.305) started 15 games in the outfield last season and will take over in left field full-time. Four freshmen and two upperclassmen will compete for the final two outfield spots.

“Florida will be interesting - guys can really step up,” noted Shive in reference to the open spots in the starting lineup. “It will be competitive.”

There should be considerably less competition in the starting rotation, where the Mules return their three top starters from 2009. Senior Phil Cresta will look to regain the form that made him an All-CC second teamer as a sophomore. Battling through injury last year, Cresta went 5-3 with a 4.61 ERA.

Juniors Jason Daniels and Kevin Witmier will also be in the rotation. Daniels won three games a season ago, and Witmier 
started seven games in an injury-plagued season.

Shive is the lone returnee in the bullpen, where he posted a 4.50 ERA, second-best on the team, as a middle reliever. Fisher will return to the mound after not pitching last year to take over the closer role.

The trip to Dodgertown may not only help sort out some of the open spots in the lineup and bullpen; it may also help provide some inspiration as the Mules look for a return trip to the postseason.

“Being on the campus that the Dodgers used to run camp will be interesting,” commented Shive. “Guys are excited to get the feel of a major league camp.”

torphy wins elite 88 award again





Muhlenberg senior Bobby Torphy received the Elite 88 award at the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships, hosted by Wartburg in Waverly, Iowa.

Instituted for the fall 2009 season, the Elite 88 award is presented to the student-athlete with the highest grade-point average at each of the NCAA's 88 championships. Torphy also received the
prestigious honor at the 2010 Indoor Track and Field Championships and is the only person in the short history of the award to win it twice.

Torphy was presented with the award at a banquet on Friday. As for the race itself, on Saturday, Torphy finished 146th out of 279 runners, an improvement of 23 places from his finish at the national meet
last year.

Torphy, at the front of the pack in the above picture, was part of a strong showing by the Centennial Conference: Haverford won the team national champion and had the individual champion, and Dickinson came in fifth.

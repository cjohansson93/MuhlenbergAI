Our Summer Advising Program connects you with your academic advisor to begin planning your Muhlenberg career. They will walk you through the options for classes and make recommendations based on your interestsâwhether you have an idea of what major you would like to pursue or are still deciding. Your advisor will answer any questions you have and probably a few you havenât even considered.
The Summer Advising welcome session is packed with fun activities that will give you many chances to connect with your future classmates. Afterward, youâll join a group of fellow incoming students and meet with your Summer Advising Guideâan upper-class peer mentor who will be with you throughout the day. They will lead a discussion with your group and then guide you through your day, taking you to events like the Student Life Fair and answering any questions that might come up.



During Summer Advising you will begin to learn about the student services available on campus. From academic support to community engagement opportunities to dining options to student activities to the Career Center, you will begin to become familiar with Muhlenberg and get answers to your questions about transitioning to the College. We also want to make sure that when you arrive on campus, you can focus on the things that matter most to youâso we help you get all the official stuff out of the way like finishing off paperwork and getting your ID.

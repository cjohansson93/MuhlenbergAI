Biology Major
The biology curriculum is designed to provide students an opportunity to study the principles governing life processes within the broader context of the liberal arts. Students investigate the science of life at all levels, from molecular biology to population ecology. Courses are designed to develop each student's ability to acquire and interpret data, pose questions, and critically evaluate facts and theories. By proper selection of biology and other science courses, a student will be prepared for graduate school in the life sciences, for admission to medical, dental, veterinary, and other health profession schools, and for positions in government or industry.
Major Requirements
 
To declare and be retained as a biology major, a student must maintain a 2.00 grade point average based on the courses attempted which satisfy the biology majorâs requirements.  No courses numbered below 204, except BIO 160, BIO 165, and BIO175, can be used to fulfill the biology major requirements.  
Required Courses:
Biology majors must complete nine biology courses and four cognate courses.

Biology courses
Three introductory courses:
BIO 160 â Foundations of Biological Inquiry 1 course unit 
BIO 165 â From Ecosystems to Organisms 1 course unit
BIO 175 â From Organisms to Molecules 1 course unit
For pre-requisite purposes, the previous introductory coures, BIO 150, 151, and 152 will be considered as equivalent to BIO 160, 165, and 175, respectively.
Five biology electives:
Five biology electives numbered between 204 and 900, which may include ESC 312 - CUE: Toxicology, NSC 311 - Neurons & Networks, SUS 350 - Community Sustainability in Costa Rica, and up to one credit of BIO 970 - Biology Independent Study/Research.  At least one course must be from each of List A, B, and C.

One biology CUE numbered between 400 and 499.

BIO 262 - Cultural & Economic Botany 1 course unit
BIO 265 - Behavior 1 course unit
BIO 268 - Freshwater Ecology 1 course unit
BIO 270 - Ecology 1 course unit
BIO 272 - Field Marine Biology 1 course unit

List B

BIO 250 - General Physiology 1 course unit

List C
Courses studying cells and molecules, including a lab component:
BIO 205 - Cell Biology 1 course unit
BIO 215 - Genetics 1 course unit
BIO 220 - Biochemistry 1 course unit
BIO 225 - Microbiology 1 course unit

Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CUE):
One of the biology courses numbered between 400 and 499.  This is an advanced, seminar style course that incorporates inquiry-oriented student projects.

BIO 405 - CUE: Cell Biology of Human Disease 1 course unit
BIO 412 - CUE: Molecular Biology of Cancer 1 course unit
BIO 423 - CUE: Scanning Electron Microscopy 1 course unit

BIO 470 - CUE: Evolution 1 course unit
BIO 472 - CUE: Genomes and Gene Evolution 1 course unit
BIO 487 - CUE: Host-Bacteria Interactions 1 course unit

Cognate courses (4 courses)
CHM 103 - General Chemistry I 1 course unit
CHM 104 - General Chemistry II 1 course unit

Any two additional courses (2 course units) chosen from:

Chemistry: 
CHM 201/203/205 - Organic Chemistry I 1 course unit
CHM 202/204/206 - Organic Chemistry II 1 course unit

Computer Science: 
CSI 102/104/106/109 - Computer Science I 1 course unit

MTH 223 - Calculus III 1 course unit
MTH 226 - Linear Algebra 1 course unit
MTH 227 - Differential Equations 1 course unit
MTH 240 - Transition to Abstract Mathematics 1 course unit
MTH 314 - Applied Mathematics & Modeling 1 course unit
MTH 331 - Probability 1 course unit

Physics: 
PHY 121 - General Physics I 1 course unit
PHY 122 - General Physics II 1 course unit

Note:
In consultation with their advisor, students preparing for careers in the health professions should consider completing a year of Organic Chemistry and a year of General Physics. 
Students seeking teacher certification for secondary biology education should contact the department head.

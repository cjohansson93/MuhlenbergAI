Men's Lacrosse Drops Opener
 Wednesday, February 19, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team had a number of “firsts” in its opening game of the 2014 season, but it could not pick up its first win of the new campaign.

Montclair State, a team that was 14-5 and earned an NCAA Tournament berth last year, scored five second-quarter goals to break open a close game and went on to win, 11-7, in a game played on a field bordered by huge piles of snow.

Sophomore Steven Casella scored the first two goals of his career for the Mules, including one to open the second-half scoring. Junior Pat Farrell followed suit 37 seconds later to make it 7-5 with 9:48 left in the third, but the Red Hawks ran off the next three goals.

Farrell scored a pair of goals for his first career multiple-goal game; he entered the season with one goal in his career. Senior Tom Glancy also netted a pair, while junior John Hetzel (left) notched his first career point with an assist. (corrected 2/21)

Junior Jason Mertz recorded a career-high three assists to go along with a goal, and sophomore Jashon DeSenna led the defense in his first career start with four ground balls and four caused turnovers.

Three Earn Women’s Lax Honors


After making the Centennial Conference playoffs for the first time, the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team placed three members on the All-CC squad.

Sophomore Amanda McGovern was a second-team selection. The midfielder was second on the Mules with 37 goals and third with 54 points – more than double her 2007 total. She also ranked second in draw controls (33) and fourth in ground balls (30). McGovern is 14th in the CC in both goals per game and assists per game.

Muhlenberg’s top two scorers, senior Taylor Armstrong and junior Ruth Morrongiello, received honorable mention. Armstrong leads the CC with a school-record 50 assists and is second with 82 points. Morrongiello led the Mules with 41 goals (seventh in the CC) and 59 draw controls (third in the CC).







Rotfeld also made the All-CC team as a doubles player as a freshman in 2006.


Junior Muhlenberg women’s tennis players Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld 

were selected to the All-Centennial Conference team.

Powell earned honors as a singles player, and she and Rotfeld were saluted as a doubles team.

Powell went 7-2 at No. 1 singles in the CC, including a three-set win against the fall CC individual champion and a straight-sets victory against the 14th-ranked player in the region. She was 7-4 overall.

The No. 1 doubles pairing of Powell and Rotfeld teamed up to win seven of nine CC matches, with their only two losses coming to regionally ranked duos. The Mule twosome also reached the final of the CC Invitational in the fall.

Powell and Rotfeld are Muhlenberg’s active career leaders with 66 and 68 combined wins, respectively.

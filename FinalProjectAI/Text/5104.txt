volleyball splits two at buttermaker





Williams tied for the team lead with 22 digs and added 7 kills in the Neumann match.



The Mules took the Knights deep into the night.

The Muhlenberg volleyball team 
defeated Neumann, three sets to two, in a Buttermaker Tournament match that ended close to 11:00. The win gave the Mules (2-5) a split of their
two matches on the opening day of the tournament; earlier they lost to FDU-Florham in three.

Behind the serving of senior Brittany Williams, Muhlenberg jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the decisive fifth set and cruised to the win. Williams served back-to-back 
aces to make it 3-0, and a pair of kills by sophomore Jackie Price also contributed to the run.

Neumann was within 11-5 before senior Phylicia Lee scored three straight points on two kills and an ace – one of 14 aces by the Mules in the match. After the
Knights (0-7) scored the next two points, junior Caitlin Dombkowski ended the match with her fifth kill.

Lee finished with a match-high 17 kills and 19 digs, while Price hit .400 and recorded a career-high 16 kills with only two errors. Sophomore Brooke McQueen just
missed a double-double, with 9 kills and 8 digs, and Dombkowski set a career high with 5 blocks. Freshman Bryn Baker’s 44 assists were a career best.

Lee paced the Mules with 15 kills in the FDU match, while senior Christina Cangelosi scooped up 28 digs.

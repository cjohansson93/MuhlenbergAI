decade in review, part 1




In December 1999, who could have predicted what the next 10 years would hold for Muhlenberg athletics? Most people weren’t even sure what would
happen in the next few weeks, but fortunately the Y2K scare was just that.

The decade about to end was one of unprecedented growth and success for the Mule athletic programs. Over the next two weeks
(this Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), we’ll take a look
back at some of the highlights of the last decade, letting the numbers tell the story. Along the way, we’ll reveal the athlete of the decade
in 22 sports, the male and female athletes of the decade and the teams of the decade.

Featured in Part 1 are the athletes of the decade in volleyball, men’s lacrosse, men’s track and men’s tennis, as well as one of
our three athletes of the decade.

PowerPoint document.

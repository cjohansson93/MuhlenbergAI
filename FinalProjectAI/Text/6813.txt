Special Day Has Special Ending for Women's Lacrosse

For the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team, a change in jersey colors corresponded with a change in outcome against Centennial Conference rival Dickinson.

Last year, the Mules (7-7, 2-6) lost to the Red Devils (7-8, 3-5) in double overtime, and although it seemed like this year’s game was going to be extended in similar fashion, junior Ally Shaffer buried a free-position shot with 15.6 seconds left to give the Mules a 16-15 win.




Shaffer's game-winning goal was her eighth of the season.




“It was terrifying because I usually freeze up on my free shots and miss them,” said Shaffer of her last-minute opportunity to win the game. “I missed one last year that cost us a game, so I just kept telling myself, ‘This is my moment and I want to get this in for my team.’

“We’ve had a really rough year so far with a lot of tough losses so I knew how badly we wanted this win,” she added. “We were fighting for a good cause – for ovarian and breast cancer – and so it was such a meaningful game.”

To raise awareness, Muhlenberg donned teal shirts with pink letters and Dickinson pink shirts with teal in honor of the mothers of Muhlenberg senior Ali Gabriele and Dickinson senior Chloe Golod, who were high school teammates. Both mothers have battled the diseases multiple times.

“We really put a lot together to do this – the signs and the balloons and the colored shirts,” stated Shaffer. “We were all really pumped up because we knew the game would be such a meaningful experience.”

The Mules took a quick lead on a goal by sophomore Stephanie Umbach 35 seconds into the game, but Dickinson tied it up 12 seconds later, setting the stage for a contest that would feature 10 ties and five lead changes.

With 38 seconds to go until the halftime break, junior Michelle Certosimo netted a goal to tie things up at six.




Freshman Arielle Sherman scored a goal and tied for the team lead with three ground balls.




Muhlenberg started the second half on fire, netting three goals in the first 1:25 to jump to a 9-6 lead. However, Dickinson made a run of its own, scoring four goals in a row to retake an 11-10 lead with 16:26 to play.

The teams exchanged goals for the next 8:01 before the trio of Molly Davin, Certosimo and Umbach, who finished with five points apiece, teamed up to score three goals in 32 seconds, giving the Mules a 15-13 edge.

The Red Devils responded with two scores of their own to tie it up at 15 with 3:42 to go. 

“We always kept our heads up,” said Shaffer. “We always cheered each other on for every little thing. We all worked together as one team and one family and pushed as hard as we could to get the win.”


With 1:14 left, senior Alexandra Franck caused a turnover in front of the Muhlenberg goal to give her team one final offensive opportunity.

Dickinson then committed a foul in the fan to set up Shaffer’s free-position goal, and although the Red Devils won the ensuing draw control, their final shot sailed wide of the cage.

Franck led the defense with four caused turnovers and senior goalie Tiffany Kreider made 12 saves to help Muhlenberg win its second CC game in a row.

“We felt like we needed to beat them. We had so much fire and fuel from losing to them in double overtime last year,” explained Shaffer. “It was such a tough loss last year, so we used that as fuel to push ourselves in this game. We really gave it all we had.”

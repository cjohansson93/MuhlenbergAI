women’s tennis beats anotherregionally ranked opponent 





Winston has a combined record of 18-5 this year.


The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team completed a successful 3-0 week on the road by winning at Salisbury, 6-3.

The Mules (4-3) entered the week ranked 10th in the Atlantic South Region and 


Men’s Golf 6th



The Muhlenberg men’s golf team was sixth out of 15 teams after the first round of the Mid-Atlantic Regional at Hershey Country Club.

The Mules had a team score of 322, five strokes behind fifth-place Rochester and a stroke ahead of Centennial Conference rival Franklin & Marshall.

Sophomore Zachary Oyer led Muhlenberg with a 79.



defeated the two teams ranked directly ahead of them in No. 8 Swarthmore and No. 9 Salisbury.

To beat the Sea Gulls, Muhlenberg won four of five of 

four closely competed matches.
Seniors Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld played a great match at No. 1 doubles to post an 8-5 win against a Salisbury duo that came in with a perfect 10-0 record.
At No. 3 doubles, sophomores Danielle Winston and Lindsay Schmidt came from behind to pull out a 9-8 win, giving the Mules a 2-1 lead heading into singles competition.

Muhlenberg led 4-3 with two matches left on the court and secured the match by winning both. Sophomore Sara Sutker at No. 4 and senior Jenn Powell at No. 1 both came back after dropping the first set to win in three.

Winston followed up her tough doubles victory with a much easier 6-1, 6-2 singles win against an opponent who defeated her in three sets last year. Rotfeld also won at both doubles and singles.

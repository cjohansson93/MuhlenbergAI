Track Teams Open Outdoor Season in Rain

Baseball Drops CC Opener


There was plenty of raking going on during the Muhlenberg baseball team’s Centennial Conference opener against Washington. Much of it came from the Mule players and coaches who poured drying agent onto the rain-soaked field at every opportunity. It also came from the batters, who combined for 19 runs and 20 hits and scored in all but three half-innings.

When the game was called in the top of the seventh due to deteriorating conditions, the Shoremen had a 12-7 win. The second game of the scheduled doubleheader was rescheduled for Sunday, April 6.

Down 12-3 heading into the bottom of the sixth, Muhlenberg (7-9, 0-1) got the tying run to the on-deck circle. After a two-run single by junior Jimmy Cody and an RBI hit by senior John Scuderi, the rally appeared to die out on a run-scoring double play.

But the Mules reloaded the bases, only to have the inning end on a deep fly ball to center.

Scuderi drove in three runs in a game that featured seven hit batters and 15 walks as pitchers struggled to find their grip on the cold, wet ball.

Sophomore Stephen Sroka, shown running last year in more desirable weather, finished sixth with the eighth-best 3,000-meter time in team history.



On a day more suited for ducks than Mules, the Muhlenberg track and field teams opened their outdoor season at the Lafayette 8-Way Meet.

The cold, windy and rainy conditions led to the pole vault being canceled for safety reasons and the Mules holding out many athletes for fear of injury, but they still had some impressive performances in a meet with five Division I schools.

Junior Cora Wallace and freshman Michelle Gaykowski went 1-2 in the discus. Wallace’s throw of 113-8 topped her previous career best by almost three feet and moved her up to fifth on the all-time performance list. Gaykowski entered the performance list in seventh place in her first time throwing for Muhlenberg.

Seniors Nicki Cronin (second in the 3,000) and Scott Reutter (third in the long jump) also posted top-three finishes. Cronin’s time was good for third on the performance list.

Sophomore Ashley Riley set a personal best in the triple jump and was one of 30 Centennial Conference qualifiers for the Mules.

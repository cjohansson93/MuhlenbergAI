Time zone considerations

Time zones are something to consider early in conversations with faculty and in determining your schedule for academic work
If in different time zones, make sure to check the settings on your online materials, as some tools have the ability to adjust to the local/regional time, while others will show the Eastern time zone of Muhlenberg regardless of where you are currently
Have conversations with faculty related to recording sessions if time zone differences result in a web session in the middle of the night based on time zones

Communications

Be in contact with faculty and staff at Muhlenberg should there be any changes or questions/concerns arising at any time in the semester and your studies related to technologies and course material access
Contact your faculty so they know you are receiving messages and also with an additional means of communication (such as a personal email address) should you be comfortable doing so
If you are noticing any content within Canvas or other areas of your course are not opening or seem to have error messages that your peers are not mentioning, let your faculty know
Best efforts are being made, however, sites or web addresses might restrict over geography or not be available in all regions

Items to check

Work with faculty on adapting any alterations to technologies to be used in a course if know there is an issue and do so at the start of the semester (or as soon as aware of any issue)
Check any eBooks in your courses early to ensure access to content and let faculty know if there are any items not working

Collaboration and Community

Leverage ways to connect with your classmates through technology, whether in discussion boards or other areas your faculty made available, Muhlenberg related activities and events being broadcast when possible and of interest, and/or by forming virtual study or conversation groups. You are very much part of the Muhlenberg community

Technical assistance

If you are experiencing technical issues, please let the Office of Information Technology know as soon as possible, so that we can assist you.

Understanding there may be a time difference, please provide the best time to contact you if follow-up is needed.

How can I access College resources from off campus? VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, allow users to securely access a private network and share data remotely through public networks. If students require access to the campus network, they may contact the Student Help Desk for more information at helpdesk@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3566. Please note: VPN access does not guarantee access to campus resources like Google in countries which restrict their usage, specifically mainland China.
  
For faculty/staff working with students who are remote learning outside United States
Flexible design


Consider flexibility in tools/technologies students need to complete tasks, providing options (multimodal)
Know that videos embedded in Canvas might come across country-specific restrictions (example: mainland China) if the videos originate from sites like YouTube

Muhlenberg-hosted videos might serve as an alternative, as will finding several video options on a topic or theme. Vimeo may be an alternative in some geographic regions, but not all.

Check early with eBook providers if using digital books if there are workarounds for students outside United States if problems encountered, or of known issues


Plan adaptively for webconference/Zoom meeting


Consider whether having multiple video feeds (such as all students with webcams on) is needed as that can affect performance quality of video
Consider providing the slides sharing in additional area (such as within Canvas) for any students to refer to outside of the meeting in case of bandwidth or performance issues
Be mindful of time zones and weigh synchronous sessions (and whether to record) accordingly


Look into the technology and tools used in your course, and any country-specific restrictions, limitations, or access issues, including ones such as

Communications

Facilitate upfront conversation setting expectations of how, when communicating with students and what to do if you are not receiving responses or expected messaging (lets you know if messages received, any challenges being encountered). 

Consider having the students send an email, with you sending a response early to ascertain if any issues with email access

Consider starting your course with the access conversation and a low/no stakes walkthrough where students submit something to you demonstrating things are working, or submitting a write up of the issue(s) encountered
Create a common ground area for conversation among students who are in person and those who are at a distance (ex. Virtual coffee/conversation forum in discussion board, collaboration space outside the class times that allows students to study/interact together via technology)

This provides more ways for community to form and reduces possible feelings of separation

Connect students at a distance with most responsive routes for support for technology they will be using

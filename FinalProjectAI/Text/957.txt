The Health Professions Advising (HPA) office, in alignment with the College's Diversity Strategic Plan, is committed to an inclusive and supportive student experience. We are undertaking a number of initiatives that will provide additional assistance to students who have traditionally been underrepresented in medicine (URM), those at a disadvantaged socioeconomic status and those who are first-generation college students.The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) defines URM as racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population. Socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) and first-generation students are determined based on the occupation and education of a student's family or guardians.In addition to seminars, mentoring, and professional development opportunities for our students, our office will be creating online guides on the College website and in Canvas to ensure that our underrepresented students have a broad means of receiving support that can be critical to their acceptance to and success in medical school.We thank our partners in this effort: the faculty on the College's PreHealth Advisory Committee (PHAC), the Muhlenberg Minority PreHealth Society (MPHS) and also the students from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University/St. Luke's "Minorities to Medicine Pipeline Program". Students who are interested in learning more should complete this brief form. By doing so, we will ensure you are updated as programs are scheduled and additional resources become available.

Weill Cornell Medical Schoolâs Travelers Summer Research Fellowship Program
Program Dates: June 21, 2021 - August 6, 2021Deadline Date: February 1, 2021
The Travelers Summer Research Fellowship Program is designed to give 25 premedical students deeper insights into the field of medicine, including issues that greatly affect the health of traditionally underserved groups. Through the experiences of laboratory or clinical research, the student learns how one pursues a specific research problem under the supervision of a faculty member, thus providing an early education into basic research techniques that could be applicable to any area of medicine. A lecture series explores topics in cardiovascular physiology, exposing the students to basic science concepts that are relevant to a more specific understanding of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, both of which are major problems in minority communities. The summer fellows attend a series of talks by minority physicians about various medical specialties, addressing issues of concern in these physicians's daily work plus views of the bigger picture in health care to minority communities. Shadowing physicians provide further exposure to the clinical facets of medicine. Students in the summer program receive information on the medical school admissions process, and counseling on financial planning for medical school and how to examine the financial aid package.

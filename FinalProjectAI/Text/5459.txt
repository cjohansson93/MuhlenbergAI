On a windy day at Lehigh’s Goodman Campus, the Muhlenberg men’s cross country team blew past many of its rivals.

The Mules finished fourth out of 41 complete teams at the Paul Short Run, beaten only by Ithaca (ranked sixth in the Atlantic Region), Messiah (sixth in the Mideast Region) and Division I Manhattan. 

Ranked 10th in the Mideast, Muhlenberg outscored No. 8 Gettysburg by 20 points and No. 9 Grove City by 138. The Mules also beat two Division I squads (Wake Forest and San Diego) and a host of Division II teams. They finished well ahead of local rivals DeSales and Moravian as well as Centennial Conference foes Swarthmore, McDaniel, Ursinus and Franklin & Marshall (in addition to Gettysburg).

For the second year in a row, seniors Timothy VanSyckle and David Chorney placed in the top 10 in a field of  270 runners. VanSyckle was fourth in 25:40, the best time ever by a Muhlenberg runner at the Paul Short Run, and Chorney was 10th.

The women placed 17th out of 37 schools - beating conference foes McDaniel and Franklin & Marshall as well as Moravian. Sophomore Kate Mahoney (left) was 31st out of 255 runners, improving her time from last year’s Paul Short Run by more than two minutes.

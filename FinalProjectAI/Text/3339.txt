chorney fourth at penn relays


Muhlenberg senior David Chorney continues to outdo himself in the steeplechase. He broke the school record yet again, this time by more than seven seconds, 
at the Penn Relays.

Chorney crossed the finish line in 9:11.63 – the fourth-fastest time in Division III this season (corrected 4/24). He placed fourth out of 17 competitors in the field, which consisted 
of 13 runners from Division I, one from Division II and three from Division III. A Cortland State runner won with the fastest Division III time of the year, and athletes
from Syracuse and William & Mary also finished ahead of Chorney.

Since first competing in the steeplechase last year, Chorney has broken the school record every time he’s run it, lowering the previous mark by more than 38 seconds:

9:49.72 - old record
9:33.39 - Greyhound Invitational (April 19, 2008)
9:27.79 - Centennial Conference Championships (May 3, 2008)
9:24.48 - Swarthmore Last Chance Meet (May 13, 2008)
9:19.03 - Sam Howell Invitational (April 4, 2009)
9:11.63 - Penn Relays (April 23, 2009)

Junior Jennifer Lynch also represented Muhlenberg at the Penn Relays, running in the Olympic Development 5,000 meters.

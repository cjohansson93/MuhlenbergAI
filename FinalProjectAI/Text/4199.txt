Womens tennis wins marathon matchover Haverford





Sanders won 6-2, 6-3 at No. 3 singles to give her a combined 10 wins on the season.



The wait was definitely worth it for the Muhlenberg womens tennis team.

In a match that lasted more than six hours and did not end until almost 10:30 p.m., the Mules overcame a one-point deficit after doubles play by sweeping the singles matches for a 7-2 win over Haverford.

The win moves Muhlenberg (6-3, 4-2) into a three-way tie for third place in the Centennial Conference.

After Haverford (10-2, 4-2) jumped ahead early by pulling out a pair of close doubles matches, the Mule seniors gathered their teammates for a quick pep talk before singles play.

We just told each other that going into singles with one win was better than none, senior Caitie Druker said. We felt like we gave some points away during doubles, but knew that if we played as hard as we could and battled for every point that we could come back during singles.

The Mules took that message to heart. Freshman Nina Sanders, who did not lose a game with classmate Emily Szulman at No. 3 doubles, got the momentum going by breezing through her singles match for her second win of the day.

Then Druker and classmate Sara Sutker, who both dropped their opening sets, battled back to pull out consecutive wins in third-set supertiebreakers to put the Mules up by two.

With a chance to clinch, senior Danielle Winston capitalized with a relatively easy straight-sets win in front of a special guest. Winston's mother, Julie, was not able to make it to the Mules' senior day two Saturday's ago. Wanting one more chance to see her daughter play, she flew into Allentown and surprised Danielle on Tuesday afternoon.

With the victory secured, Szulman and senior Lindsay Schmidt, who was the last Mule on the court, closed out the sweep.

According to Druker, the win could not have come at a better time for the Mules, who are in the thick of the CC playoff race.

This was a really big win, especially after losing to them 5-4 last year, she said. They are one of the teams that is competing for the playoffs, so to beat them was huge.

We may all be a little tired, but its OK because we were able to get the win.

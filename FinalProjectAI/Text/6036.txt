Field Hockey Flies Past Bryn Mawr
 Wednesday, October 5, 2011 - page 2







					 


A little more than 10 minutes into the Muhlenberg field hockey team’s game at Bryn Mawr, a skein of geese circled above Applebee Field searching for the pond located on the Owls’ campus.

And just moments after the birds discovered their rest stop, the Mules found what they had been 



Katz’ goal paved the way for the Mules to score at least three goals for the third straight game – the first time they’ve done that since 2006.



looking for when senior Jillian Katz put home a rebound off a shot on a penalty corner to give Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead less than 15 minutes into regulation.

The Mules would go on to add another goal just minutes later and two more in the second for a 4-0 win, their 15th straight over the Owls.

It was Muhlenberg’s first shutout of the season and gave 



Senior Renee Norton came off the bench 10 minutes into the game. She was one of 28 Mules to play in the game.




it three consecutive wins for the first time since September 2009.

“I was just in the right place at the right time,” Katz said of her team-high eighth career goal. “It felt really good to help the team pick up another win.”

Less than three minutes after Katz’ goal, freshman Kayleigh Thies controlled an insertion, dribbled into the top of the circle and drove a shot past Bryn Mawr’s keeper. She struck again less than 10 minutes into the second half on an almost identical bullet of a shot that also rattled the back of the cage.

The two goals bring her season total to seven to go along with 17 points. Both are tops on the team and amongst freshmen Centennial Conference freshmen.

With many of Muhlenberg’s reserves getting valuable playing experience, sophomore Jenny Catalano added one final tally, the first of her career, in the 65th minute.

Sophomore Kristin Lang delivered a pass from the right sideline into the middle of the circle. Catalano got her stick on the ball and redirected it into the left side of the cage to close out the scoring.

With less than two minutes to play, the Owls got the ball into the circle on a breakaway and caught Muhlenberg’s keeper off her line. But freshman Ray Gallagher swept in and stopped the shot from going into the corner of the cage to preserve the shutout.

The Mules held a commanding 26-6 advantage in shots, and junior Kristin Dornenburg made four saves.

“This feels great,” Katz said of the winning streak. “We’re really coming together; we’re communicating; we’re working well as a team. We’re having a lot of fun and playing loose, which has helped us play better.”

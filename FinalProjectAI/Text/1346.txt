A major component in OMLâs mission is the development and stewardship of brave spaces on Muhlenbergâs campus, fostering open and honest dialogue across difference. On this page, learn about the physical spaces, programs and partnering student organizations, which help us to fulfill this mission.
Multicultural Affinity Groups:
OML currently advises eight student organizations formed on the basis of cultural or identity affinity. As advisors, OML provides these groups with meeting space, leadership development in the form of retreats and trainings, and organizational support and troubleshooting. These groups provide service to the College by serving as another home-away-from-home for many of our students. These groups also serve as both advocates and educators through intentional programming and event planning.

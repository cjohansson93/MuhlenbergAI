THREE WRESTLERS SCORE PINS  





In a non-conference tune-up before five straight Centennial Conference matches, the Muhlenberg wrestling team fell just short against Scranton, losing 28-21.




With the Mules trailing 12-0, sophomore Kevin Homan got the team on the board in a big way with a quick pin. Homan led 4-2 with 14 seconds left in the first period when he scored a pin at 141, winning his third straight bout.

Muhlenberg suffered a difficult one-point loss on a third-period escape at 149 and a major decision at 157, but junior Keith Swanson (right) kept the team alive with a decisive 12-7 win in which he led 6-0 after the first period.

A pin at 174 and another one-point loss, again on a late escape, put the Mules out of reach with two bouts remaining. But despite knowing the match was decided, sophomore Nick Pallotta and freshman Chris Galletta (above left) both scored fast pins. Pallotta pinned his opponent at 197 in 1:26, and Galletta was even faster with a pin 1:11 into his bout at heavyweight.

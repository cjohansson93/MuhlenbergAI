Seven Unlucky for Diamond Teams
 Sunday, March 24, 2013







					 





An oddity of the baseball doubleheader was that both teams had a player in the starting lineup named Nick Kennedy. Here Mule sophomore Danny Usewick
tags out the Crusaders' Nick Kennedy on a rundown in the first game.


Seven was an unlucky Palm Sunday number for the Muhlenberg diamond teams.

Both baseball and softball were swept in non-conference doubleheaders. In three of the four games, the opponent scored seven runs, and all
three times, the game ended with the potential tying runs on base or at bat.



Baseball fell to Susquehanna, 7-6 and 7-4, while softball lost to New Jersey, 7-5 and 4-0.

The first game of the baseball doubleheader went to the ninth inning with the score tied at 4-4. After the Crusaders (8-10) plated three
runs in the top of the inning, the Mules (10-7) loaded the bases with one out in the bottom half. A throwing error allowed two runs to score
and put runners on second and third with two out, but the game ended on a groundout.

In the second game, Muhlenberg trailed 7-2 before scoring twice in the bottom of the eighth on a bases-loaded walk and RBI single by
junior Brett Rosen to make it 7-4. The Mules got the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth but were turned away
again.




The loss in the second softball game came despite a strong pitching effort from sophomore Heather Porrini, who pitched a complete-game six-hitter and allowed only one earned run.



Senior John Muha had a phenomenal twinbill, going 7-for-9 with three runs scored. He now has 159 career hits, good for fifth
place on the program’s all-time list.

In softball, the Mules once again came close to their first win ever against New Jersey but came up short, spoiling a milestone day for
Kelly Kline. Muhlenberg is 0-41 all-time against the Lions.

The Mules were behind 7-3 entering the top of the seventh in the first game. Two of the runs came on solo homers by junior Chelsea
Benjamin and Kline, the latter giving the junior a school-record 94 career RBI.

In the seventh, Muhlenberg (10-4) loaded the bases with one out, forcing the Lions (12-4) to make a pitching change. But the relief pitcher 
issued bases-loaded walks to Benjamin and Kline, making the score 7-5 and advancing the potential tying run into scoring position. TCNJ
went back to the starting pitcher, who got a line-drive double play to end the game.

Muhlenberg got its first two runners on in the top of the first of the nightcap but could not score and did not have another serious threat
in getting shut out for the first time this season.

Men’s Golf Opens on Cold Day: The Muhlenberg men’s golf team tied for ninth place at the Gettysburg Spring
Invitational in cold, windy conditions on Saturday. Senior Brandon Davis shot an 83, five strokes off the lead, to pace
the Mules in their first tournament of the spring.

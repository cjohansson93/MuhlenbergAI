The 10th player in team history to reach double figures in triples, Cody also stole two bases and is hitting .300 through five games.


The Muhlenberg baseball team fell to 0-3 on its Spring Break trip to Myrtle Beach with an 11-7 loss to a Manchester team that is ranked in the top 10 in the Division III preseason polls.

On the strength of three home runs, the Spartans built a 10-1 lead heading into the bottom of the sixth. The Mules (2-3) got two runs back in the sixth, with junior Danny Usewick delivering his second two-out RBI of the game; he also hit a run-scoring double in the second and reached base in all four of his plate appearances.

Muhlenberg plated three more runs in the seventh on an RBI single by senior Max Litvak, his second hit of the game, and a two-run double by senior John Scuderi, his second two-bagger of the game.

Junior Jimmy Cody hit his 10th career triple with one out in the eighth and scored on a groundout to make it 11-7, but the Mules did not get another runner on base.

Junior Seth Fenster had an impressive two-inning relief stint, retiring all six batters he faced, striking out two.

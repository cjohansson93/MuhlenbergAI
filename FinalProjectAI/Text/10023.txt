Drew Krumholz '08 B.A. in Spanish
Muhlenberg College 
Drew Krumholz, the New Jersey Union County 2014-2015 Teacher of the Year, is entering his seventh year as a Spanish teacher at Jonathan Dayton High School and has worked his entire career thus far for the Springfield Board of Education. He has been very active in his district’s one to one Apple laptop initiative, serving as a peer coach to faculty members and frequently turn keying workshops that are geared toward designing 21st Century classrooms. Drew has also worked closely with the consulting firm, “Innovative Designs for Education” to help design learner-active, technology-infused classrooms for his district and other districts statewide.
He also spends a significant amount of time promoting acceptance of all individuals and to infuse this as a theme in curricula across disciplines. He is a co-founder of the high school’s Gay-Straight Alliance and continues to advise the organization. Drew is a firm believer that all students are capable of achieving at high levels of success. Drew was named the Union County Teacher of the Year as part of the New Jersey Department of Education’s Teacher Recognition Program.  Drew graduated from Muhlenberg College in 2008 with a B.A. in Spanish and has spent time abroad studying in Seville, Spain.  He also spent a semester developing his linguistic skills at New York University and intends to pursue a Master’s Degree in the near future.

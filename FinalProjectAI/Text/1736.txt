Building Usage Policy and Procedures





Policy Statement
The Trexler Library exists primarily to serve the academic needs of Muhlenberg College. It is the Library's policy to support, maintain, and manage the Trexler Library facilities in the best interest of the full Muhlenberg College community and, as appropriate and allowable by licensing, to provide open access to the library collections and services as good neighbors to the greater public. This policy governs activities related to general building usage, posting of advertising and outreach materials, area noise activities, room scheduling and usage, food and drink in the library, destruction of property, and related usage procedures.
Purpose of Policy
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for appropriate, unbiased building usage, to address specific usage concerns, and to outline appropriate behavior when using the library facility.
Building Usage Procedures
Purpose of Procedures
The purpose of the building usage procedures is to clearly articulate expected behaviors, activities, and appropriate use of the Trexler Library building.
Procedures

General Building Usage

The library serves as a central place for research, study, reading, intellectual exchange, new information development, and academic curiosity. Activities within the library will be in support of these usage responsibilities. All library users will be expected to behave accordingly.

Posting of Advertising and Outreach Signage

Trexler Library has three bulletin boards available for postings: by the elevator on Level A, and outside of the restrooms on Level B and C. Postings should be related to non-profit Muhlenberg-affiliated events, or of general interest to the campus community. Items should not be taped on the walls, stacks, restrooms, elevator, windows, doors, or furniture of the library unless approved by library staff. Appropriate signage to enable ease of use of the collection will be determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Unit Managers. Postings must be appropriately produced (no handwritten postings). Flyers should be limited to no larger than 8.5â x 14â. The library will allow posting of the items that are provided, but will not provide free copying services. Individual exceptions to these rules can be made at the discretion of the Library Director.

Area Noise

Recognizing that academic learning takes many forms, the library provides appropriate areas for research, interactive study, and active learning. Level A and open terraces serve as open interactive spaces where group activity, speaker forum activities, and appropriate socialization activities are welcome. Cell phone usage is allowed in these designated spaces. Level B is designated as the primary small-group intensive study workspace where quieter level work can be held. Level C serves as the silent, individual study floor. In the case of speakers' forums or special programming occurring on Level A or the terrace levels, the doors to Level B and Level C may be closed in consideration of study needs. Throughout the library, courtesy and consideration should govern all conversations. If a complaint is made, or if a member of the library staff judges any activity to be potentially disturbing and inappropriate for the location, the person(s) involved may be asked to move to another area or to cease the activity.

Room Scheduling and Usage

Various offices on campus control the scheduling of rooms in the library building as follows:

Fulford Room, B-01 Library Instruction Room, Rare Books Room, B-02 Classroom, Seminar Rooms, and the Information Commons: Contact Trexler Library at 484-66-3551.

Only Faculty and Staff can reserve the Fulford Room, B-01 Library Instruction Room, Rare Books Room, B-02 Classroom, Seminar A, and the Information Commons. Students, Faculty, and Staff can reserve Seminar C. 
Note: The Library maintains first priority in scheduling the B-01 Library Instruction Room and the Information Commons in all cases. The Library may bump scheduled users from these rooms up to 72 hours before a scheduled event. For the first two months of each semester, the Information Commons and B-01 Classroom are unavailable for outside reservations due to the heavy library instruction use. Otherwise, the B01 Library Instruction Room and Information Commons are available for open access when classes are not scheduled. Usage and scheduling exceptions will be granted at the discretion of the Library Director.


Curriculum Lab: Contact Registrar's Office at 484-664-3190 or Education Department at 484-664-3298. 

The Curriculum Lab is scheduled by Registrar's Office for classes during the day. The Lab remains accessible to education students when classes are not scheduled.



Group study rooms are also available throughout the library. In all cases, groups will be given priority usage over individuals in these group study rooms. Individual users may be asked to move to a different space when a group needs the room for study activities.

Food and Drink

Trexler Library allows the consumption of food and appropriately covered drinks in all public spaces of the library. In accordance with college policy, alcohol is not permitted in the library except for officially approved functions. Library users are expected to appropriately dispose of all trash materials, and use recycling containers when appropriate. In the event of a spill, library users are asked to notify a staff member so measures can be taken to clean the area as soon as possible.

Destruction of property and vandalism

As is appropriate in any campus building, destruction of property including vandalism to furniture will be handled expediently through a report to the Campus Public Safety office. Graffiti on furniture, purposeful destruction of books/periodical/AV materials, and other related acts of vandalism will be taken seriously and will result in immediate action in keeping with campus policy.

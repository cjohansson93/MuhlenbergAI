Women's Basketball Shoo-ts Away Hornets
 Friday, November 18, 2011 - page 2







					 





Sophomore Ellen Rich finished with three rebounds, an assist and a steal.



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team’s Scotty Wood Tournament opener against Shenandoah was brought to you by the number “3” and the letter “S”.

That’s “3” for 3-pointer and “S” for sharing as the Mules drained 13 threes, five each from senior Alexandra Chili and junior Alita Zabrecky, and assisted on 25 of their 32 field goals as they cruised past the Hornets, 94-60.


Muhlenberg (2-0), which has advanced to the championship game in each of the Tournament’s 19 years, will face New Jersey, a 69-58 winner over Neumann, in Saturday’s championship game at 6:00.




Lesher needed just eight minutes to score her eight points.



After the Mules jumped out to a quick 10-point lead five minutes into the game, Shenandoah (1-1) settled in and stayed close for much of the first half.

But Zabrecky scored eight points in the final 2:12, including two of her five first-half 3-pointers, to help the Mules lead by 15 at the break. She finished with a team-high 24 points, 19 in the first half, and six rebounds.


“A lot of that had to do with me getting good looks from my teammates,” Zabrecky said of her high-scoring half. “Katy [Rossino] and Hannah [Rush] did a great job of getting the ball to us in space, which made it easy for us to score.” 

In the second half, it was Chili’s turn to heat up from the outside. She scored eight of the Mules’ first 10 points and hit a trio of 3-pointers to extend the lead to 20 at the 15:02 mark.

That’s when some of Muhlenberg’s newcomers got a chance to show their stuff as four freshmen scored the first points of their careers.

Emliy Lesher led the rookies with eight points, while Janelle Fleet added five. Classmate Hannah Rush dished out a team-high five assists.


According to Zabrecky, with the Mules looking to play at a fast pace this season, it is important for the freshmen to get involved to help keep the upperclassmen fresh.

“The freshmen are really playing well right now,” Zabrecky said. “They’re fitting in well with the group, and they definitely have a lot of talent. We’re really excited to see what they can do and what they can add to our team.”

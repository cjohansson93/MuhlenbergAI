Strong Second Half Pushes F&M Past Women's Lacrosse

For 30 minutes, Irish Eyes were smiling on the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team as it hung with No. 8 Franklin & Marshall.

But any St. Patrick’s Day luck ran out at halftime, and the Diplomats flexed their top-10 muscle, scoring the first five goals of the second period en route to an 18-9 win.

The two teams traded goals for the first 10 minutes before F&M (4-1, 1-0) rattled off three straight to go up 6-3 at the 16:26 mark. But the Mules (3-1, 0-1) responded, scoring four of the next five goals to pull even 6:13 before the break.

Sophomore Michelle Certosimo started the rally with a pair of goals sandwiched around an F&M tally. The first came on a free position shot and the second off a pass from senior Kelsey Elmer at the 8:06 mark.

A little more than a minute later, Elmer found junior Alex Bellini to pull the Mules within one, and then freshman Stephanie Umbach buried a feed from sophomore Ally Shaffer to tie the score at 7.

But the Dips reeled off a 7-0 run spanning halftime to take control and hand the Mules their first loss of the season.

For the second straight game, Certosimo and junior Molly Davin (left) recorded hat tricks. They also each added an assist to their three goals to help the Mules surpass their combined scoring total from the previous two meetings with F&M.

Freshman Stephanie Umbach scored twice for her third multiple-goal game of the season and also led the team with five draw controls and three ground balls. Junior Tiffany Kreider stopped a career-high 10 shots in goal and picked up three ground balls.

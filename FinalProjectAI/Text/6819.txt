Thimmel Breaks Discus Record at Moravian

Lacrosse Teams Fall at Home


Milestones, comebacks and plenty of goals made for an entertaining afternoon of lacrosse at Scotty Wood Stadium, but both Muhlenberg teams were defeated by McDaniel, the women 15-12 and the men 14-13 in double overtime.

The women’s game followed an almost identical script to last year’s matchup against McDaniel, in which the Mules cut a second-half seven-goal deficit to one before losing, 15-14. This time around, the Mules (5-6, 0-5) trailed 12-4 early in the second half before scoring eight of the next nine goals to close to within a goal.

The Green Terror scored the last two goals, however, to escape with the win.



Junior Michelle Certosimo recorded six points on three goals and three assists to surpass the 100-point mark for her career. She finished the game with 102. Sophomore Stephanie Umbach led Muhlenberg with four goals.

The men played a wild game in which they jumped out to a 4-0 lead early in the second quarter but had to come from behind three times in the second half. With the Mules trailing 13-12 and less than 30 seconds to play, senior Jack Reilly drew a holding penalty, then fed classmate Doug Rheiner for the tying goal with only 6.8 seconds remaining. It was Muhlenberg’s third game-tying in the final 10 seconds of regulation this season.

Both teams had opportunities to score in both overtime periods, and the Green Terror finally connected 1:12 into the second extra session to hand the Mules (6-7, 2-4) their first home loss of the season.

Reilly (above), one of nine Muhlenberg seniors recognized after the game, finished with a career-high six points on three goals and three assists to go over the 90-point mark for his career. Sophomore Jon Thomas netted four goals to move to within two of tying the school record for goals by a second-year player.

Freshman Jessica Thimmel broke the school record in the discus in the third meet of her career, highlighting a busy weekend at three different venues for the Muhlenberg track and field teams.

Thimmel (right) threw the discus 120 feet, 8 inches to finish second at The Coach P Open, hosted by Moravian. She tied the previous record of 119-6, which had stood since 1989, in the opening meet of the season.

Two other throwers had noteworthy achievements. Freshman Jordan Rosenthal finished third in the javelin – first among collegiate competitors – in wet, windy conditions on Friday night, and freshman Daniel Cano improved his personal best, which ranks 10th on the Mules’ all-time performance list, in the discus.

Junior Stephanie Carnevale set a personal record in the 100-meter hurdles, bettering her previous mark by five hundredths of a second to 15.12, the second-fastest time in team history.

At the Bucknell Outdoor Classic, senior Samantha Mayden ran a personal-best 4:37.39 in the 1,500 meters. She and classmate Erica Bash both qualified for ECACs.

The weekend began with two Muhlenberg athletes competing in the Mondschein Multi at Kutztown on Thursday, but they did not finish all the events due to Friday’s heavy rain.

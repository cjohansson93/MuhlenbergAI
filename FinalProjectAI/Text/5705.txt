kein takes top honors at williams





Kein has a record of 15-3 this season.



The summary on the Williams Web site identified the Most Outstanding Wrestler of the Williams Invitational as Rob Klein. The proper name of that honoree shared one
characteristic with his performance at the tournament: no “L.”

Muhlenberg junior Rob KEIN went 4-0 at the 149-pound weight class to win his second tournament of the season and earn the honor. Kein’s wins included a 13-7
semifinal decision against an Ithaca wrestler ranked ninth in Division III.

Kein was one of three Mules to capture his class. Junior Billy Hall won at 141, and senior Joe Tartar notched a pair of pins in winning the 285-pound title. 
Junior Matt Horn was second at 184.

Muhlenberg finished fifth out of 10 teams in a field that included nationally ranked Williams and Ithaca.

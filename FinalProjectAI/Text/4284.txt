must have an overall grade-point average of 3.200 (on a 4.000 scale) or its equivalent and must have performed with distinction as a member of the varsity team in the sport in which the student-athlete was nominated. He or she also must be an outstanding citizen and excellent role model for the institution and intercollegiate athletics as a whole and intend to continue academic work beyond the baccalaureate degree as a full-time or part-time graduate student. 

A biochemistry major who intends to attend medical school, Torphy has racked up an impressive list of academic and athletic awards. He was the first two-time winner of the Elite 88 Award, given to the student-athlete with the highest grade-point average at each of the 88 NCAA championship events. He is a two-time Academic All-American, earning first-team honors in 2010, and will be a strong candidate again in 2011.

Torphy has competed in the NCAA Championships four times, qualifying as an individual runner for cross country each of the last two years. He finished a career-best 20th at the NCAA Mideast Regional in 2010 and went on to place 146th at the NCAA Championships.

On the track, Torphy was an All-American as part of the Mules distance-medley relay team that finished fourth indoors at the 2009 NCAA Championships. He also competed in the NCAA indoor meet in the 800 in 2010 and provisionally qualified in the mile this season. Torphy is part of four school records indoors, in the 800, mile, 4x800 and DMR.

Torphy is the 14th NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship recipient in Muhlenberg
history and the first since wrestler Matt Loesch in 2007.

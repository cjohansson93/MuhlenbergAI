Admission Requirements for Non-Traditional Students
The Education Department of Muhlenberg College welcomes applications by non-traditional students for certification programs. Applicants should schedule an appointment with an advisor in the School of Continuing Studies for an initial interview and transcript review.
After reviewing transcripts, a preliminary plan for complying with certification requirements will be developed and additional documents will be requested. In order to make a final determination for program admission, the School of Continuing Studies and the Education Department will review official transcripts, rÃ©sumÃ©, letters of reference, and the applicantâs personal statement and self-evaluation.
If admitted to the Teacher Certification Program, the applicant will again meet with an advisor in the School of Continuing Studies to finalize program requirements and to register for classes. Additional information is available from the School of Continuing Studies.

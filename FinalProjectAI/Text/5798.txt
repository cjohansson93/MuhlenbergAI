Men’s Soccer Achieves Goal, Scores 2


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team began the 2007 season with a flourish, putting on a wonderful display of attacking soccer in a 2-0 



Junior Andrew Brick and the rest of the back four enabled the Mules to open the season with a shutout for the second year in a row.




victory over Gordon at Varsity Field.

“The first game is always very 
emotional,” said junior midfielder Steven Tenenzapf, “We tried to set the tone by bodying them up and going in hard and establishing that we’re here and this game isn’t going to be easy for them.”

Setting the tone is just what the Mules did as they created several scoring chances from the outset before Adison Weseloh scored in the eighth minute. The sophomore forward controlled a deflected pass and unleashed an 18-yard strike to the upper left corner, the ball hitting the crossbar before going in.

The Mules struck again in the 38th minute when Tenenzapf collected A.J. Barnold’s clearance 30 yards from goal and proceeded to beat two Gordon defenders before tucking a hard shot inside the right post from 16 yards out.

A Muhlenberg player received a red card and was sent off in the 68th minute, and the ensuing man-advantage enjoyed by Gordon for the rest of the match enabled the Fighting Scots to control the ball and attack more easily, calling Mules senior goalkeeper Peter Bennett into action.

Bennett made a save with his foot to deny a Gordon player in a 1-on-1 situation in the 79th minute. With less than four minutes remaining, Bennett made two great saves in quick succession to preserve the shutout. First, Bennett dove to his left to save a 15-yard shot that traveled between several players. Then, having given up a rebound, Bennett quickly got off the ground to redirect another Gordon player’s point-blank effort.

“We take pride in our home field in general,” Tenenzapf said. “We [almost] never lose here. We have tremendous pride here. We set a goal to win today and keep a shutout, stay really compact in our defense, stay smart and make good decisions, and that’s what leads to a shutout.”

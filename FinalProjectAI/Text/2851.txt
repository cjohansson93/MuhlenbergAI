NO OVERTHROW FOR WRESTLING 





Facing the red-hot Monarchs of Kings in its first home match of the season, the Muhlenberg wrestling team could not summon a coup détat.

The Mules fell, 42-3, to a Kings team that entered the match fresh off defeating two nationally ranked foes over the weekend and winners of eight of its last nine.

Sophomore John Sternlicht (right) recorded the Mules lone win with a 6-2 victory at 184. After a scoreless first period, Sternlicht chose the down position to start the second and immediately escaped, taking a 1-0 lead. In the final thirty seconds of the period he recorded a takedown and a three-point near fall to widen his lead.

Junior Keith Swanson nearly pulled off a major upset at 157. Facing an opponent that had beaten the No.2-ranked wrestler over the weekend en route to being named d3wrestle.coms Division III wrestler of the week, Swanson scored a takedown and an escape in the first period to go up 3-2. Down 6-3 in the third, he managed an escape to pull within two, but could not come up with an equalizing takedown.

women’s basketball: no upset this time



3K Runners Excel at Lehigh


The Muhlenberg indoor track and field teams enjoyed success in their first trip to the Lehigh Covert Classic, a meet consisting of mostly Division I and II schools.

Senior David Chorney won the 3,000 meters, breaking his own school record by nearly five seconds. His counterpart in the women’s 3,000, junior Jennifer Lynch, also finished first with the second-best time in school history. Both runners qualified for the ECAC Championships.

Freshman Marc Brookland moved up to third on the Mules’ performance list in the triple jump, finishing second. Sophomore Bobby Torphy and senior Stuart Udis went 1-2 in the 800 meters.

So much for history repeating itself.

In 2007, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team traveled to Washington with a 13-1 record and ranked 23rd in 



Brenna Ferster’s three-point play with 2:49 left in the half gave the Mules a 39-21 lead.



Division III, only to suffer a 64-63 loss, snapping a 22-game winning streak against the Shorewomen.

Considering the long bus ride, the Mules’ tendency to play close games, and Washington’s improvement this season, the possibility of another upset existed when 25th-ranked Muhlenberg made its trip to Chestertown.

Not this time. The Mules (14-2, 11-0) put together one of their most complete games of the season, taking control early on and going on to topple the Shorewomen, 79-55.

The 24-point margin of victory was Muhlenberg’s biggest in Centennial Conference play this season. The Mules shot 48.5 percent in the first half in opening up a 20-point lead at the break, shot 53.3 percent on three-pointers for the game, held Washington (9-6, 4-5) to 27.7-percent shooting and had a commanding 53-35 edge on the boards.

Down 5-0 early on, Muhlenberg went on a 17-2 run to take a 10-point lead. Senior Lauren Boyle scored eight of her 16 points and also contributed an assist in the run.

The Shorewomen scored the next three points but never got closer than seven. The Mules led by as many as 26 points in the second half after making five three-pointers in the first 5:32 of the second half – three by freshman Alexandra Chili and one each by
junior Kaitlyn O’Malley and sophomore Kelly McKeon.

Sophomore Sheila Cook tied for the team lead with a season-high 16 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Chili finished with 15 points, and McKeon came close to a triple-double, with 10 rebounds, 9 points and 8 assists.

The men’s game followed a similar pattern, only with the teams reversed. Muhlenberg made only five first-half field goals, fell behind 19 at the break and could never recover in losing, 71-61.

Junior Obi Nwizugbo scored 10 points for the Mules (8-7, 4-5), and freshman Spencer Liddic pulled down 10 rebounds and blocked three shots.

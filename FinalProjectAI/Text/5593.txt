women’s lax picks up vital deja vu win


During the second half of the Centennial Conference match-up against Washington, the members of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team must have had feeling of a déjà vu.
Ten days ago, the Mules had a comfortable eight-goal lead at halftime and almost allowed a miraculous second-half comeback on behalf of visiting Drew but eventually held on to the win.




Junior Sara Hiller added three points for the Mules on two goals and one assist.


The encounter against Washington followed nearly the same scenario with the Mules posting a 15-13 away victory. 
After the two squads had traded goals in the opening stages, Muhlenberg scored six unanswered goals to establish a 9-3 cushion going into halftime.
“We settled back too quickly,” senior Taylor Armstrong said.
At the beginning of the second period, the Mules saw their lead evaporate quickly like boiling water in a pot abandoned on a stove.
The Shorewomen scored six of the first seven goals to draw within one, 10-9. Then, Armstrong set up sophomore 
Alyssa Bascelli on two occasions to bring Mules’ advantage back to three goals, 12-9, with 9:49 remaining. 
Muhlenberg’s lead didn’t last long as Washington equalized the score with three goals in a span of three minutes.
At the six-minute mark, senior Ruth Morrongiello gave the visitors a lead they wouldn’t relinquish and just a minute later dished out an assist to freshman 
Rachael Goldstein, who capitalized for 14-12.
The two squads exchanged a goal apiece in the waning minutes to shape the final result, 15-13 for Muhlenberg.
With their third victory in the last four conference matches, the Mules keep making steady strides toward first-ever CC playoff appearance. With three games remaining and having played against all three CC nationally ranked opponents, the team has already accumulated more league wins (3) than it did last year (2).
“I have no doubt we’ll make the playoffs,” Armstrong said. “We knew that if we won this game, we’ll get a lot closer to the playoffs.” 
Armstrong took active participation in eight of the 15 Muhlenberg goals on the day as she finished with a career-high seven assists and one goal.
Morrongiello scored four goals and contributed a team-high seven draw controls, while sophomore 
Amanda McGovern and Alyssa Bascelli added hat trick apiece.
For the second consecutive game and the fourth time this season, freshman goalkeeper 
Allisyn Vachon finished with double-digit saves – 11, including seven in the intense second half, when the Shorewomen besieged her goal and fired the ball 18 times. 
“We definitely wanted to beat Washington after last year’s loss by one goal,” Armstrong said.
Last season, Muhlenberg suffered an 11-10 setback at home to the Shorewomen, surrendering a goal with just over a minute to play.

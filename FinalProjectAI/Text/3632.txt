Sophomore Alita Zabrecky of the Muhlenberg womens basketball team was named co-player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Zabrecky scored 18 points in each game as the Mules remained undefeated with wins against Swarthmore and Washington. She shot 52.0 percent from the field and averaged 5.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 3.0 steals in the two games.

For the season, Zabrecky leads Muhlenberg in rebounds (7.0 per game) and steals (18) and is second in scoring (14.3 points per game) and assists (20). She is shooting 51.5 percent from the field, including a lofty 59.5 percent in CC games.

Zabrecky is the only player in the CC to rank in the top 15 in the league in scoring (tied for eighth), rebounding (tied for 12th) and assists (tied for fifth). She also is second in steals, fifth in field-goal percentage and sixth in assist-to-turnover ratio.

Seymour Lipton     (American, 1903-1986) Study for Reef Queen,1955 Oil crayon on bond paper
 The drawing entitled Study for Reef Queen demonstrates Lipton’s artistic process. This preparatory drawing is the first step in Lipton’s sculptural production process. After drawing the study, Lipton creates a small-scale maquette and finally works out the physical problems of enlarging the maquette to full scale in nickel silver and Monel metal.
Lipton’s work is thematically grounded in the context of the American post-war period. The works dealing with nature and its regenerative processes are among his most interesting and thought-provoking pieces.

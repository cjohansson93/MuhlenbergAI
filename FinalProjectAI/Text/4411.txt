Senior Keith Swanson improved his team-best record to 12-5 with a 3-1 day, including a pair of pins in the consolation bracket.

While the start was almost picture perfect for the Muhlenberg mens basketball team against Gettysburg, the ending was anything but perfect.

The Mules stormed out of 



the gates by scoring the games first nine points. But that hot start eventually cooled as Muhlenberg fell, 61-54, by the battlefield.

Junior Spencer Liddic was a big reason for the Mules opening salvo. He compiled a double-double by halftime and finished with a team-high 20 points and 16 rebounds.

After falling behind out of halftime, Muhlenberg (8-7, 4-4) charged back and took the lead midway through the half thanks to back-to-back 3-pointers from sophomore Rob Berish. The game was tied at 42 with nine minutes left before Bullets (9-6, 6-2) went on a 10-2 run to take command.

Freshman Austin Curry (right) joined Liddic in double figures with 14 points, while Berish added 10 points and 5 boards.

In the first game of the doubleheader, the Muhlenberg women shot a season-low 29.3 percent from the field and fell at Gettysburg, 70-57. 

The Mules (10-3, 6-2) cut a 13-point deficit to five with seven minutes to play by going on an 8-0 run, but the Mules could not get any closer as the Bullets (10-4, 5-4) closed the game with a 15-7 run. 

Senior Kelly McKeon scored a season-high 17 points. Juniors Alexandra Chili and Kathleen Naddaff joined McKeon in double figures with 14 and 10 points, respectively. 

The loss dropped the Mules into a virtual three-way tie for first place in the Centennial Conference with Johns Hopkins (8-2) and Ursinus (7-2), their next two opponents.

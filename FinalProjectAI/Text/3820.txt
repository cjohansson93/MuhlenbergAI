Oyer's record dayleads men's golf to third-place finish


While the Muhlenberg men's golf team posted its lowest score in the first round of the Centennial Conference Championship, senior Zachary Oyer saved his best golf for last.

On the strength of three birdies, Oyer (right) tied the conference championship record by shooting a one-over 71 in his closing round to place second and help the Mules to their third straight third-place finish.

His career round was also the best ever by a Mule at the championship and Muhlenberg's lowest round in more than two years.

Oyer, who finished three shots off the lead with a 54-hole total of 17-over 227,  became the first Muhlenberg player since 2003, and only the third ever, to place in the top three as he was named All-Centennial Conference for the second year in a row. The top six finishers at the championship earn all-conference recognition.
 
Senior Jordan Carpenter earned the first top-10 finish of his career after tying for 10th, while juniors Matthew Cohen and Zack Meyers finished 13th and 23rd, respectively.

The Mules, who have placed in the top three each of the past four seasons, stormed out to a seven-stroke lead after the first round, but cooled during the final 36 holes and were eventually passed by McDaniel, which won its record sixth title.

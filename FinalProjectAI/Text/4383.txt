liddic named player of the week



For the second time this season, junior Spencer Liddic of the Muhlenberg mens basketball team was named player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Liddic averaged 21.5 points and 11.5 rebounds while shooting .630 from the field to lead the Mules to a pair of important CC victories. He had 23 points and 11 rebounds in a 77-69 win at Haverford and 20 points and 12 rebounds in a 54-48 win vs. Johns Hopkins, increasing his CC-leading double-doubles total to 11. 

Liddic was a virtual one-man show, contributing to 21 of Muhlenbergs 28 second-half points, in the tight game against Hopkins. He scored 14 himself and assisted on three field goals that accounted for seven additional points. His assist in the final minute led to the clinching basket.

For the season, Liddic leads the CC in points per game (21.5) and rebounds per game (10.6). He also is fifth in field-goal percentage (.546) and tied for 11th in blocked shots (14). 

Liddic is rapidly climbing the Muhlenberg and CC all-time scoring and rebounding lists. With 1,120 career points, he ranks 20th in Mule history, and his 667 rebounds are good for 21st in league history.

The two wins moved Muhlenberg from sixth place in the CC at the start of the week to a tie for fourth at the end. With six games remaining in the regular season, the Mules are just a game out of second place.

As a part of the year-long forum, The Legacy of 1989: Twenty Years in the Post-Communist World, Muhlenberg College will hold a screening of the film Up the Yangtze on Wednesday, March 31, 7:00 p.m.- 9:00 p.m., in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall.

Professor Chris Herrick, of the political science department, will introduce the film. The screening is free and open to the public.
The Three Gorges Dam, a gargantuan and hotly contested symbol of the Chinese economic miracle, provides the epic and unsettling backdrop for Up the Yangtze, a dramatic and disquieting feature documentary on life inside the 21st century Chinese dream.

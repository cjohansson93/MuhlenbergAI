For the second straight Saturday, the Muhlenberg field hockey team won an overtime thriller against a team that has received consideration in the national Division III poll this year, defeating Washington College, 2-1. In between, the Mules breezed past Bryn Mawr, 8-0.

“I prefer games like this,” said senior Lauren Jordan (left), who scored the winning goal with 4:54 left in the first overtime. “You’re forced to work together. Everyone really stepped up, and it’s nice to know you can beat a team that’s really competitive.”

The Shorewomen (10-2, 3-2), whose only previous loss was in double overtime, have received votes in the poll for most of the season. Muhlenberg (9-2, 5-1) is currently receiving votes.

For the third straight game, the Mules came out strong and scored the first goal before 10 minutes had elapsed. After a Muhlenberg pass from outside the circle was deflected into the air and landed just outside the cage, play seemed to stop for a split second, and senior Samantha Swire (right) took advantage of the uncertainty to tap the ball into the cage for her fourth goal of the season.

Washington tied the score about six minutes later, and the game remained 1-1 through the remainder of the first half and the entire second half. Sophomore Claudia Theriault made a defensive save with about 11 minutes left to keep the score knotted. (corrected 10/13)



The Mules finally broke through on their fourth penalty corner of the overtime period when Jordan deflected senior Heather Porrini’s blast past the goalie.

“Heather had a great shot from the top, and I just happened to deflect it in,” said Jordan, who could not remember the last time she scored a game-winning goal in overtime. “I don’t think I’ve ever been happier! I subbed in [about a minute before scoring the goal], and everyone was getting tired. We just wanted to score and for it to be over.” 

Thanks to Jordan’s heroics, the game is over but not Muhlenberg’s winning streak, now at a season-high five. The Mules are tied for second in the Centennial Conference behind two nationally ranked teams they have yet to play, and they’ve beaten three of the four teams directly below them in the standings.

“We’re doing really well,” said Jordan. “We have really good potential to go far in the conference.”

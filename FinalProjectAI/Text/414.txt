 Louis Kurz (Austrian, 1835-1921) Battle of Gettysburg,1884 Oil on canvas
  Painted in 1884 by Louis Kurz and measuring over twelve feet in length, this mural depicts the Civil War battle of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The mural served as a model for color prints which were distributed throughout the United States and abroad at the turn of the century. Kurz was the partner of Alexander Allison and together, the artists built the famous Chicago-based printing firm of Kurz and Allison (the midwestern counterpart to Currier & Ives). Prints depicting the Civil War battles by Kurz and Allison are among the most sought after collectibles of Civil War enthusiasts. Kurz and Allison prints have been published, including a print after the mural in Muhlenberg’s collection, in such magazines as Civil War Times and Life.

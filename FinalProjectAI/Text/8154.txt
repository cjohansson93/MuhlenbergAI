The Business program at Muhlenberg aims to develop the whole person and connect academic study with personal and professional development. All Business majors complete an "eEPortfolio" web site to highlight academic and personal work, and promote accomplishments and projects throughout the Muhlenberg years. ePortfolios are a great marketing tool for internships and jobs, helping establish your identify, develop a personal brand, and prepare for work after college.
Your ePortfolio is a curated collection of digital materials that show your learning journey over time. ePortfolio contents can relate to specific academic work in business and the liberal arts, your college learning process, and other accomplishments on- and off-campus. Materials can include writings, photos, videos, research reports, observations by mentors and peers, and/or reflective thinking.
Business students start their ePortfolio in an early course (BUS 233), and maintain it through to the end of the Business CUE in their senior year. Along the way, you add assignments and accomplishments from other experiences and course work, and shape with feedback from ePortfolio faculty coaches.

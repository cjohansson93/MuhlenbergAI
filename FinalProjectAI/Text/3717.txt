toher named player of the week



For the first time in her career, junior Michele Toher of the Muhlenberg women's soccer team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Although many shots got "to her," Toher let few by her as the Mules split with CC front-runners Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins. The two teams outshot Muhlenberg, 62-17, but Toher kept her team in both games.

She made a career-high 15 saves in a 2-1 loss to Swarthmore, then stopped eight shots -
allowing only a penalty kick goal - in a 2-1 upset of No. 8 Johns Hopkins. The Blue Jays came into that game averaging a CC-best 3.31 goals per game.

Toher is second in the CC with a .904 save percentage in league games, and her CC goals-against average of 0.82 ranks third.

The split left Muhlenberg (5-6-2, 4-2) as one of four CC teams with two league losses. Dickinson and Swarthmore are both 5-1 to lead the Conference.

Track Teams Enjoy Best Meet to Date
 Saturday, February 8, 2014 - page 2







					 






Aldrich’s time of 8.38, an improvement of 0.03 on the personal best she set last week at Lehigh, is just a hundredth of a second
off the third-best clocking in program history.



Three weeks before the Centennial Conference Championships, the Muhlenberg track and field teams had their best overall performance of the 2014 indoor season.  




Senior Jarrett Felix finished fourth in the 800.



Although the Mules did not have a winner, they did have four second-place finishers in the 17-team Frank Colden Invitational at Ursinus: seniors Nicki Cronin in the 800 meters, Stephanie Carnevale in the 60-meter hurdles and senior Charlie Kline in the mile and freshman Trevor Luck in the high jump.

Cronin and Carnevale posted ECAC-qualifying times, as did sophomore Claire Thornton in the 800.

The above were among 28 performances that were in the top eight in the meet. The teams also combined for 30 new or improved CC qualifying marks.

Seven Muhlenberg athletes landed on the program’s all-time top 10 lists: sophomore Francesca Aldrich (fourth in the 60), Cronin (sixth in the 800), freshmen Michelle Gaykowski (ninth in the shot put), Jake Waleski (seventh in the 60) and Jesse Deffler (seventh in the pole vault), senior Scott Reutter (ninth in the triple jump) and sophomore Daniel Cano (ninth in the shot put).

Both Mule teams came in fourth in the scored meet.

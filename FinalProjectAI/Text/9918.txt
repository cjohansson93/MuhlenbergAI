Roomful of Teeth

Roomful of Teeth is a GRAMMY-winning vocal project dedicated to reimagining the expressive potential of the human voice. Through study with masters from vocal traditions the world over, the eight-voice ensemble continually expands its vocabulary of singing techniques and, through an ongoing commissioning process, forges a new repertoire without borders.
Founded in 2009 by Brad Wells, Roomful of Teeth gathers annually at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) in North Adams, Massachusetts, where theyâve studied with some of the worldâs top performers and teachers in Tuvan throat singing, yodeling, Broadway belting, Inuit throat singing, Korean Pâansori, Georgian singing, Sardinian cantu a tenore, Hindustani music, Persian classical singing and Death Metal singing. Collaborators include Rinde Eckert, Fred Hersch, Glenn Kotche, Merrill Garbus (of tUnE-yArDs), William Brittelle, ACME (American Contemporary Music Ensemble), Nick Zammuto (of The Books), Toby Twining, ICE (International Contemporary Ensemble), Ted Hearne, Silk Road Ensemble and Ambrose Akinmusire, among many others.

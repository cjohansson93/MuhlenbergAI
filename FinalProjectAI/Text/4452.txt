A program-record five members of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team received All-Mid-Atlantic Region honors from the National Soccer Coaches Association
of America.

Following a year in which they went 13-3-6 and advanced to the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament, the Mules were ranked 12th in Division III in
the final NSCAA poll. It's their highest year-end national ranking since the 1995 “Final Four” team ended up at No. 3. Muhlenberg also came in
at No. 14 in the final D3soccer.com poll.

Making the all-region first team for the second year in a row were junior Cody Antonini and senior Jason Daniels.

Antonini (far left) led the Mules in scoring with 39 points on 16 goals and 7 assists. Heading into the national semifinals, he was tied for ninth
in Division III in total goals and tied for 12th in total points. An All-Centennial Conference first-team selection for the second straight year, 
Antonini will enter his senior season tied for ninth on the program’s all-time scoring list with 78 career points.

Daniels (second from left) had a fantastic season in goal, leading the CC and ranking 20th in Division III with an .873 save percentage. He was
30th in the country in goals-against average (0.60) and recorded 32 saves while allowing only four goals (one on a penalty kick) in the Mules’ five
postseason games. He finished his career with a record of 24-7-8 in two years as a starting goalie, making the All-CC first team both years.

Senior Matt Cecconi, sophomore Danny Way and senior Eric Williams were named to the all-region third team.

Cecconi (center) and Williams (far right) were both starters on the Mule back four, Cecconi at right back and Williams at center back. 
Muhlenberg allowed only 14 goals in 22 matches, ranking 24th in Division III in team goals-against average, and recorded 12 shutouts. 
Way (second from right) scored 13 goals in his first season as a starter and was the offensive star of the postseason, with 5 goals and an assist in
the CC and NCAA tournaments.

Muhlenberg’s previous high of four all-region selections came last year.

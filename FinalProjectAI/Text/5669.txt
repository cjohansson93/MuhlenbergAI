boyle repeats on districtacademic team


For the second year in a row, junior Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team was named to the 
ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II College Division team, as chosen by the College Sports Information Directors of America. A third-team selection last year, Boyle
moved up to the second team in 2008.

A mathematics major and dean’s list student, Boyle has won the Miriam E. Koehler Award for Excellence in Mathematics, the Carol Emhardt Kuntzleman Memorial Award
(for excellence and a high level of participation) and the Sidney Weikert Award as sophomore athlete of the year during her time at Muhlenberg.

Boyle also has earned plenty of accolades on the court. A 2007 first-team All-Centennial Conference selection and four-time CC player of the week, she currently leads the
16-5 Mules in scoring (14.6 points per game) and is second in assists (69), blocked shots (10) and steals (30). In the CC, Boyle ranks sixth in scoring, third in assist-to-
turnover ratio, fifth in free-throw percentage (.783) and seventh in assists. She has scored in double figures in 15 of 21 games, including six 20-point efforts, and
nearly recorded a triple-double at Gettysburg.

With her 13 points at Bryn Mawr last night, Boyle is 27 points away from becoming the third player in team history to reach the 1,000-point milestone as a junior. She ranks
fourth on the team’s all-time list in field goals made (395) and 13th in assists (172). Muhlenberg is 61-15 during her career.

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.2 cumulative grade-point average and a 
starter or significant reserve on her team.

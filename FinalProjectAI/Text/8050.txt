Field Hockey Thinks Pink and Thinks Goals

Just like the “Think Pink” poster affixed to the front of the Scotty Wood Stadium press box, Muhlenberg’s
8-0 win against Bryn Mawr had the handprints of many members of the field hockey team on it.

Seven different players scored goals and three different goalies combined for the shutout as the Mules rolled to their biggest
offensive output since 2008, when they beat Bryn Mawr by the same score.

Muhlenberg, which raised money for the National Foundation for Cancer Research during the game, extended its winning streak to four and has its best record (8-2) through 10 games since 2003. The Mules’ 4-1
Centennial Conference record is their best at the halfway point of the league season since 2007.

The backs and defenders who didn’t make the scoring column also played key roles, rarely allowing the Owls (2-8, 0-5) to
cross the center line with possession. Bryn Mawr took one shot on a breakaway in the first half and had back-to-back penalty
corners that led to a shot late in the second, but otherwise remained on one side of the field. Muhlenberg had a 52-2
advantage in shots.


Senior Christine Germaske scored two goals (one off a penalty corner that was played out after time 
expired in the first half), both assisted by classmate Lauren Jordan.

For the second straight game, the Mules jumped on top in the opening minutes, with sophomore Emily Boyle
netting the first goal just 3:19 in. Classmate Taylor Smith went to the air to make it 2-0 eight minutes later,
lofting a shot over the goalie and into the back of the cage.

Seniors Ray Gallagher, Kayleigh Thies and Samantha Swire added second half
goals, and for the second game in a row, freshman Gwen Remaley scored on a penalty stroke – although this
one, which made the score 8-0 just 18 seconds after Swire’s goal, was slightly less dramatic than Saturday’s
overtime game-winner against 20th-ranked Dickinson.

Muhlenberg has won six in a row at home, the longest streak in one season since the 2005 team strung together six straight
home wins, but will play its next three on the road, including key CC contests at 9-1 Washington College this Saturday and
sixth-ranked Franklin & Marshall next Saturday.

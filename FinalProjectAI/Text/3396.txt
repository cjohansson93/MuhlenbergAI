women’s lacrosse springs past kean





Hiller’s nine points tied for the third-most in a game in team history.


After being frozen by Gettysburg on Saturday, the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team thawed out against Kean, defeating the Cougars 20-5. 
There was a nice breeze blowing across Frank Marino 

Field, but the Mules were more like a strong wind as they kept the play on the Cougars’ half of the green for most of the game. The Mules planted 15 buds in the Cougars’ goal in the first 30 minutes, tying the school record for most goals in a half set in 2003. 
Sophomore Danielle Rosen was one of three players to score hat tricks for the Mules. Junior Alyssa Bascelli showered the Cougars’ net with four goals. Senior Sara Hiller was a bright spot for Muhlenberg, with a team-high six assists, and her three goals put her three away from the century mark. 
Senior Amanda McGovern shined with two goals and four assists, putting her past the 100-point mark. 
“She’s a great leader,” said Bascelli of McGovern. “She’s always feisty; she’s involved in every play.” 
Junior Ashley Foltiny melted Kean as she scooped up a team-leading five ground balls, and senior Ruth Morrongiello gave the Mules heat with her five draw controls. 
Muhlenberg’s skills and confidence are blooming with each game. 
“We’re keeping up the intensity,” said Bascelli. “We’re working on the small things, no matter what the situation. We come out everyday to achieve what we know we can and we’re definitely on the right track.”

Update for Spring 2022
We are pleased to announce that we have returned to the stage with a full lineup of in-person Theatre & Dance productions. However, we remind you that the covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the performing arts in any number of ways, here and everywhere.
As of March 2022, patrons are no longer required to be vaccinated in order to attend performances.
Masks will be required of all audience members at all performances. No exceptions. Masks will be provided to those who need them.
If you feel sick on the day of the show, STAY HOME. We can't emphasize this enough. We will provide a refund for patrons who cannot attend a performance due to illness or concern about illness. If at all possible, please contact us in advance of the performance, so that we can resell your tickets.
We've put together an exciting lineup of theatre and dance performances for this spring, for which tickets are on sale now!
Please take good care of yourselves. We'll see you soon!

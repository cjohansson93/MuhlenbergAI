Volleyball Comes Back Late - Really Late - in Home Opener
 Wednesday, September 5, 2012 - page 2







					 





Freshman Vanessa Pulice had a double-double with 36 assists and 11 digs.



By 9:30, weeknight volleyball matches are usually long over. But against DeSales, at 9:30 the Muhlenberg volleyball team was just getting started.

A late start time (8:30) and a tight match made for a long evening at Memorial Hall, but for the Mules it was a very satisfying evening. They came back from a 2-0 deficit to defeat their local rivals, 3-2, in a match that did not end until 10:45.

It was the first time the Mules won after dropping the first two sets since a 2009 match against Johns Hopkins. Although their Thursday morning professors might not agree, the comeback was just what the team needed heading into this weekend’s Buttermaker Tournament.

Freshman Katherine Boll made an impressive home debut with 21 kills – the most by a Muhlenberg freshman since 2002. Sophomore Holly Hynson added 12 kills to go along with a career-high 23 digs, and freshman Chelsea Kaser recorded 25 digs.

The Mules (4-1) had dropped five sets in a row, including three Saturday at Moravian, after falling behind 2-0 to the Bulldogs (1-4). They began their comeback in a strange third set that saw two yellow cards issued and several calls disputed by both teams.

Muhlenberg trailed early in the third and fourth sets but came back to win both, 25-21. Two kills apiece by Hynson and Boll staked the Mules to a 6-1 lead in the decisive fifth set, but this time it was DeSales’ turn to come back. The Bulldogs took a 12-11 lead before Muhlenberg scored three straight points on a kill by junior Morgan Duggan and two by Boll.

After DeSales scored a point to make it 14-13, Hynson ended the match with a kill.

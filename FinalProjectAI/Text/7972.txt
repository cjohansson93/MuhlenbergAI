Women's Soccer Stays Undefeated on Golden Goal
 Saturday, September 20, 2014 - page 3







					 





The last two times it has played McDaniel, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team has ended the game with a celebration.

Sophomore Abby Lazofsky scored her first goal of the season with less than a minute left in the first overtime to give the Mules a 1-0 win against the Green Terror.

The game was a rematch of last year’s Centennial Conference semifinal, which Muhlenberg won in a shootout following a scoreless tie. That game finished with a save by the Mule goalie on the final penalty kick.

The rematch looked like it was headed for another scoreless draw. Both teams had their chances in the back-and-forth game, but the defenses – which have allowed a combined four goals in 14 games – held strong.

The winning goal was set up when sophomore back Rachel Manci, making a rare foray into the offensive end, won a corner kick. Freshman Carly DeNigris sent the kick across the goal mouth and to the back post, where Lazofsky (right) was waiting to head it in.

The “golden goal” snapped the Mules’ eight-game winless streak in overtime games and extended their school-record unbeaten streak to start the season to seven.

The winner was the first goal allowed by McDaniel (5-1-1, 0-1) in 572 minutes.

 Freshman Rachel Mizrahi, making her first career start, recorded four saves for the shutout. 

The Mules (6-0-1, 2-0) entered the week ranked 10th in the Mid-Atlantic Region, and during the week they tied the team ranked eighth (Lebanon Valley) and beat the team ranked ninth (McDaniel).

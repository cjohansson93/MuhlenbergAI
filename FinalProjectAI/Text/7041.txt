Men's Soccer Keeps Playoff Hopes Alive
 Saturday, October 26, 2013 - page 3







					 




With its back against the wall, the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team needed to pick up a win at Ursinus in its next-to-last game of the regular season. And that’s just what the Mules did, despite playing the second half down a man.

Junior Lance Dotzman put in a rebound with 19:21 left to break a 1-1 tie, and Muhlenberg (8-7-1, 3-4-1) held on to snap its three-game winless streak.

A loss would have eliminated the Mules from Centennial Conference playoff contention. As it is, they still are in a precarious position. Tied for sixth place with Ursinus and Gettysburg, Muhlenberg first and foremost needs to defeat McDaniel next Saturday and hope for a Franklin & Marshall loss to first-place Swarthmore and a loss or a tie by Gettysburg to Ursinus, among other results.

The Mules took a 1-0 lead in the 18th minute on a goal by freshman Nick Sarkos. Dotzman took a shot from the left side that was blocked by a defender right to Sarkos, who slotted it in for his first career goal.

The Bears (7-8-1, 3-4-1) tied the game on an own goal just before halftime, and shortly thereafter Muhlenberg lost a player to a red card. 

But the Mules outshot the Bears by a 9-4 margin in the second half, netting the winning goal off a corner kick when Dotzman notched his team-leading seventh goal of the season after Brendan McIntyre’s header was blocked.

The win extended Muhlenberg’s unbeaten streak against Ursinus to 28 games, dating back to 1984. And it ensured that the Mules will finish with a non-losing record for the 28th straight season.

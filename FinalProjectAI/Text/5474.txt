Football rolls past union for second win


Senior Eric Santagato was responsible for all four touchdowns and the defense set up scores with two early turnovers as the sixth-ranked Muhlenberg football team won its 13th consecutive regular-season game, 31-14 at Union.

Sophomore linebacker Scott Gavin intercepted a

pass on the second play of the game, returning it 19 yards to the Union 22. Four plays later, Santagato scored on a 2-yard touchdown run. 

On the third play of the Dutchmen’s next drive, junior Jake Floyd forced a fumble with a sack. Muhlenberg recovered and converted six plays later when Santagato hit junior tight end JJ Contessa from a yard out on fourth down. It was Contessa’s first career reception, and it made the score 14-0 midway through the first quarter.

Union (1-1) took advantage of a Mule fumble to cut the deficit in half on a 20-yard touchdown run with 9:07 left in the second.

The score remained 14-7 until late in the third quarter, when Santagato hit junior Phil Cresta with a 30-yard TD pass. Senior John DeLuca had back-to-back runs of 11 and 19 yards on the 6-play, 54-yard drive and finished with 134 on 30 carries for his 12th career 100-yard game.

With 2:16 left in the third, the Dutchmen had a golden opportunity to close to within a touchdown again. A diving interception at the Mule 25 snapped Santagato’s regular-season streak of 144 straight passes without a pick. Union made it to the 18 before senior linebacker Matt Rathbun intercepted a tipped pass and returned the ball 41 yards, setting up a 1-yard run by Santagato with 11:36 left in the fourth to put the game out of reach at 28-7.

A 52-yard run by senior Erik Snyder led to Michael Katz’ 23-yard field goal late in the fourth. Union scored a meaningless touchdown on the final play of the game.

The Muhlenberg defense recorded seven sacks (corrected 9/23) and held Union to 43 rushing yards on 33 carries and 12 completions in 32 attempts. Rathbun recorded a team-high eight tackles, including one of the sacks, and junior Frank Emmett contributed a sack, a pass breakup and a fumble recovery.

The offense reached the 30-point mark for their eighth time in the last 10 games.

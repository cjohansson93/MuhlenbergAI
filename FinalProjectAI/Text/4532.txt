men’s soccer comes back for tie



The Year of the Tie goes on.

The Muhlenberg men's soccer team played its school-record sixth draw of the season, coming back from a 2-0 halftime deficit to tie New Jersey, 2-2. Junior
Cody Antonini scored both goals for his fifth multiple-goal game of the season.

In addition to breaking the school record of five ties set when the 1981 team went 7-4-5, the Mules (8-0-6) had two other more significant accomplishments.
They tied the school record for longest unbeaten streak, set when Muhlenberg went 11-0-3 over the last nine games of the 1995 season and the first five of
1996. And with Swarthmore's 2-1 overtime loss at Richard Stockton, the Mules are now one of three remaining undefeated teams in Division III (Dominican and
Wisconsin-Oshkosh are the others). Swarthmore dropped off the list a day after being crowned the No. 1 team in the country in the NSCAA poll.

The Lions (7-5-3) scored twice in the final 20 minutes of the first half to give the Mules their first two-goal deficit of the season. Antonini cut the margin in half
early in the second half when he broke loose down the left side and chipped a perfectly placed shot into the right pocket.

Just over ten minutes later, Antonini crashed the net on a Jacob Joseph corner kick and headed in the tying goal just under the crossbar. 

Both teams had opportunities in the overtime periods, but the score remained deadlocked.

Antonini (right) now has 15 goals on the season, the most by a Muhlenberg player since 1995.

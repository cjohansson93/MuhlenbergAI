Why I Study... is a feature of Muhlenberg Magazine where faculty share their research interests and academic work. This article was originally published in the Summer 2021 issue of Muhlenberg Magazine.
When I started studying film in the late â90s, scholars would make the argument that historical veracity in fiction films didnât really matter. Historians would critique inaccuracies, but film scholars found that annoying, sometimes saying history was socially constructed.
In 1915, when D.W. Griffithâs The Birth of a Nation came out, people flocked to theaters, spending up to $50 in todayâs dollars to see it. It was a blockbuster.
The Birth of a Nation was an interesting example of the historical accuracy argument because itâs a film that no one would watch and say its inaccuracies donât matter.
It depicts the history of Reconstruction. The film argues that it was a terrible mistake to give Black people rights and that they behaved terribly until the Ku Klux Klan âcame to the rescue.â
You canât critique that film without saying itâs inaccurate.
The film had lasting effects, too. Youâre supposed to feel warm and fuzzy about the endâwhite people rallying against Black people. And many people did. The story makes the Klan into heroes. At the time, the Klan had become a defunct organization. But it was refounded in Atlanta on Thanksgiving in 1915, around the time The Birth of a Nation was released there.
I teach the film in several courses, including Intro to Film Analysis and Film History. Itâs tricky because youâve got to think about why youâre showing this racist epic to predominantly white students. There might be a lesson in racism they didnât know about. For students of color, youâve got to ask whether subjecting them to these images is worth it.
I just finished writing a book called Cinemaâs Original Sin: D.W. Griffith, American Racism and the Rise of Film Culture, which will come out next year, about how cinefiles, academics and filmmakers have had to grapple with this film for more than a century. Itâs always been this troublesome object.
Recently, Spike Leeâs BlacKkKlansman had a scene of the Klan watching The Birth of a Nation. Lee uses cross-cutting, or parallel editing, a technique Griffith helped pioneer, to show Civil Rights activists listening to a description of a 1916 lynching while cutting to Klan members watching The Birth of a Nation, explicitly suggesting the film was linked to the murder.
Even though this technique is now common, there is no chance that itâs random. Lee knew exactly what he was doing: using Griffithâs techniques to condemn Griffithâs most famous film.

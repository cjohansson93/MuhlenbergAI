The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, Washington D.C.
The event took place on Monday, January 20, from 6-9 p.m. in the Seegers Union Event Space. The evening was free and open to the public.
Based on the inspirational life of an iconic American freedom fighter, Harriet (Kasi Lemmons, 2019) tells the extraordinary tale of Harriet Tubman's escape from slavery and transformation into one of Americaâs greatest heroes. Her courage, ingenuity and tenacity freed hundreds of slaves and changed the course of history. 
Following the film, Muhlenberg faculty members Emanuela Kucik, assistant professor of English and Africana Studies and co-director of the Africana Studies program, and Amy Corbin, associate professor of film studies, hosted a discussion of the film for event attendees.

Homan Goes 3-2 in Competitive Tournament



Senior Kevin Homan of the Muhlenberg wrestling team went 3-2 in the 149-pound bracket at the Central Jersey Open, hosted by The College
of New Jersey, yesterday.

In addition to collegiate wrestlers, the tournament was open to attached and unattached wrestlers who graduated from high school, and 
college prep wrestlers were also eligible. Many Division I wrestlers competed in the tournament.

Homan’s two defeats came at the hands of veteran wrestlers from Rutgers, the 14th-ranked team in Division I. He defeated opponents from Williamson Trade
School, Lycoming and Division I Drexel to run his season record to 14-3.

The Mules’s other entrant, junior Matt Parker, went 1-2 at 141.

On Saturday, the Muhlenberg basketball teams swept the Scotty Wood Tournament titles, and on Monday, they swept the Centennial Conference weekly awards.

For the fourth time in his career, senior Spencer Liddic of the men’s team was named player of the week by
the CC. Junior Alita Zabrecky of the women’s team earned the honor for the third time.

Liddic averaged 20.0 points and 15.0 rebounds to lead the Mules to a 3-0 start. He had double-doubles in all three games and was named MVP of the Scotty 
Wood Tournament for the second year in a row after scoring 25 


points in the first round against SUNY Cobleskill and pulling down 16 rebounds in the championship game against 
Immaculata.

Liddic’s big week moved him up to 12th place on Muhlenberg’s all-time scoring list with 1,281 points. He also climbed to 14th place on the
CC’s all-time rebounding list with 757 for his career.

Zabrecky averaged 20.3 points, 8.0 rebounds and 2.7 assists while shooting 48.9 percent from the field as the Mule women also started out 3-0. She was the Mules’ leading scorer and rebounder 
in all three games. 

Zabrecky scored a career-high 25 points to go along with 11 rebounds against Moravian and was named to the Scotty Wood Tournament 
all-tournament team for the second straight year. She scored 19 points in the first half alone in the opening-round win against Shenandoah.

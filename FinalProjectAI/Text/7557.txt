Wrestlers Face Tough Competition at Messiah
 Friday, December 5, 2014







					 




Three members of the Muhlenberg wrestling team won at least one bout at the Messiah Petrofes Invitational,
a tournament that featured five teams ranked in the top 30 in Division III, including the top two
(Wis.-Whitewater and Messiah).

Freshman Sean Kelly went 2-2 at 157. In his first bout, he trailed 9-3 early in the second
period before pinning his opponent. Kelly (left) went on to defeat a wrestler from Baldwin Wallace
in the consolation bracket before dropping a one-point decision to a Mount Union foe.

Sophomore Jaryd Flank and freshman Ben Peck each won the middle of three
bouts. Flank, making his season debut after qualifying for nationals in cross country, recorded a technical
fall against a Wilkes 125-pounder, while Peck, wrestling up a class at 141, edged a Wilkes wrestler, 2-1, for
his sixth win of the season.

Strong Finish for Mules, Oyer


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team had a solid second round and finished in a tie for sixth place at Allegheny’s Guy W. Kuhn Invitational.

The Mules posted the fourth-best score (309) over the final 18 holes, improving their first-round total by three strokes. They tied Carnegie Mellon, a team that was
nationally ranked last spring, for third among Division III schools.

Junior Zachary Oyer also improved in the second round, shooting a 1-over-par 73 to tie for second with a 36-hole total of 3-over 147, three strokes off the lead. 
It was the second straight
tournament in which he finished in the runner-up spot. Oyer is the first Muhlenberg golfer this decade to card a 74 or better in three consecutive rounds.
 
 Freshman Brandon Davis shot a 78 in the second round to tie for 17th.

Senior Samuel Hayden of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Hayden led a Mule defense that allowed only three shots on goal in road shutouts of Moravian (5-0) and Franklin & Marshall (4-0). Muhlenberg has shut out its last three opponents, all on the road, and has not allowed a goal in its last 286:16.

The win at Franklin & Marshall, in the Mules’ CC opener, was a big one. The Diplomats entered the game ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region and have traditionally defended their home field very well against Muhlenberg. The Mules were 1-5-1 against F&M in their previous seven trips to Lancaster, with the only win coming in the 2004 CC playoffs.

Combined with a 4-0 win against Wilkes last week, the results against Moravian and F&M gave Muhlenberg shutouts of 4-0 or better in three straight games on the road for the first time in its history. The Mules have scored a CC-leading 19 goals  in their first six games; last year it took them 11 games to score 19 goals.

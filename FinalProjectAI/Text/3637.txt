For the first time this season, the Muhlenberg men's soccer team is ranked in both national Division III polls.

The undefeated Mules are ranked 19th by D3soccer.com and 
22nd by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. Muhlenberg has been
 in the D3soccer.com poll all season, but this is its first time in the top 20 and its first time in the NSCAA top 25.

Muhlenberg (5-0-2) is undefeated in its last 14 regular-season games but will be challenged to keep that streak alive this week. The Mules travel to 
Dickinson tomorrow and Johns Hopkins on Saturday. Dickinson is ranked sixth in the region by the NSCAA, with its lone losses coming to national top-10 teams Swarthmore
and Messiah, and has knocked Muhlenberg out of the Centennial Conference playoffs the last two seasons. Johns Hopkins, ranked 13th by D3soccer.com and
25th by the NSCAA, has never lost to the Mules at home.

Leading Muhlenberg on the field is junior Cody Antonini (right), who tied a school record on Saturday by scoring two goals
in a 4-0 shutout of Gettysburg. Antonini has 10 goals in seven games and is only the third player in program history - the first since 1987 - 
to reach double figures in goals in so few games.  

Through games of Sunday, Antonini led Division III in points per game (3.29) and was one of only seven players in the country with at least 10 goals.

Teaching Interests
As a Spanish professor, my primary area is contemporary literature (1700-present) from Spain, with special interest in the representation of women, the body and medicine. My courses on The Lovesick Body and Fallen Women: Prostitution, Empire and Historical Memory explore canonical and marginal literatures within their social, scientific and literary contexts. I also teach community-based interpreting and translation, skills that allow our heritage and advanced students to combine disparate areas of interest and study with Spanish in a high-demand field. Finally, I am fascinated by the process by which beginning language students acquire the skills, confidence and sense of curiosity to inspire them to continue studying SpanishâI always look forward to my elementary Spanish classes.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research informs my teaching, which in turn inspires new areas of study. My scholarship centers on the 19th-century novel from Spain and includes studies on the representation of domestic violence, sexuality, disease and doctors. I am also intrigued by writers who write despite a host of adversities; these include Spanish Gypsy writers and women writers. I am currently completing â(Con)Textos femeninos: AntologÃ­a de escritoras espaÃ±olas,â a critical anthology of Spanish women writers. Teaching literature in a second language has led me to study the dynamics of teaching: What makes a student want to study literature in Spanish from a different time and culture? How can science and medicine work to draw todayâs students in? Considering the broader issues of teaching, what intellectual challenges can inspire yet not intimidate students? On and beyond campus, I am a committed activist, organizer and educator around immigration and immigrant rights. I am regularly invited to lead workshops and discussions with educational, religious and community groups; speak on the radio and TV; and write for local publications.

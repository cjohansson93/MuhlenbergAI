DEFENSE AND REBOUNDING KEY MEN'S BASKETBALL
 





Barnes has been the anchor of the Mules’ offense and defense. He leads the team in scoring, rebounding, field-goal percentage and blocks.



The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team’s offense isn’t too shabby - 67.2 points per game, third in the Centennial Conference - but it’s been the defense that has keyed the Mules’ run to the top of the standings.

Muhlenberg entered the week not only leading the CC in field-goal percentage defense - it led all of Division III. A year after holding opponents to .384 from the field, fourth best in the nation, the Mules are first this season at a remarkable .345.







The Mules are also near the top of Division III in blocked shots, ranking 12th with 5.1 per game. They entered the week with two players in the top four in the conference in blocks; senior Peter Barnes led the CC with 2.03 per game, and sophomore Spencer Liddic was fourth with 1.45.

The defense was at its finest on Saturday against McDaniel. The Mules held McDaniel to just 10 second-half points, setting a school record for fewest points allowed in the shot-clock era. Barnes had three blocks in that game and three more against Franklin & Marshall yesterday.

Muhlenberg has also been controlling the glass in 2009-10. It entered the week ranked third in Division III - and first in the CC by nearly twice as much as the next best team - in rebounding margin, at plus-11.4. The Mules have been outrebounded just once all season, and that was in the season opener.

Barnes and Liddic rank near the top of the conference in that category, as well. Barnes entered the week second at 9.3 rebounds per game and Liddic third at 8.5.

All that defense and rebounding added up to a 5-0 start in Centennial Conference play, the best in school history. Now 5-1, the Mules are tied with Franklin & Marshall and Gettysburg for first. They travel to Gettysburg tomorrow night for a pivotal showdown.

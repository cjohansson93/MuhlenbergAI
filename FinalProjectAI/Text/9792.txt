Today, the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge hosted an awards ceremony to recognize select higher education institutions, educators and students for their extraordinary work in student voter engagement during the 2020 presidential election. 
Muhlenberg has received the 2021 Platinum Seal for an 80-89 percent student voting rate during the 2020 Elections. See the full list of participating campuses here. 
The 2020 presidential election engaged the largest and most diverse group of college students in U.S. history. More than 840 institutions enrolling close to nine million students participated in the ALL IN Challenge.
Muhlenberg was also recently recognized for its high student voting rates in a new report from the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE). The student voting rate at Muhlenberg rose to 82.6% in last yearâs presidential election, far exceeding the 2020 national college-student voting rate of 69% for private institutions and 66% for all institutions.  
The Collegeâs nonpartisan student organization BergVotes, the Office of Community Engagement (OCE) voter promoters and other volunteers helped ensure students were registered and able to vote in the fall 2020 presidential elections, whether they were on campus or taking courses remotely due to the pandemic.
The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge (ALL IN) is a national, nonpartisan initiative of Civic Nation, a 501(c)(3) organization. ALL IN strives for a more inclusive democracyâone in which all voices are heard. Their program provides structure, support, and recognition to strengthen college and university efforts to improve civic learning, political engagement and voter registration and participation.

If you look carefully at religious traditions in your own neighborhood or around the globe, you quickly discover that different religious communities think very differently about the way the world works.
To understand our fellow humans, we must examine these worldviews that are rooted in the religious and cultural contexts of diverse communities. Only by carefully considering and analyzing these differences can we understand how others perceive the world and act within it.
The Instituteâs mission is to strive to create a community engaged in the pursuit of understanding and analyzing how religion and culture impact our neighborhoods and our world.

two female athletes honored



With their days remaining in college coming to a close, two Muhlenberg senior athletes recently earned recognition for their accomplishments.

Basketball player Abra Like received the Helene Hospodar Award at the Senior Athlete Dinner. 

The award is given in memory of Helene Hospodar to a female senior athlete with a strong academic record who has demonstrated leadership both on and off the field or court and who epitomizes the concept of a “team player.” 

Hospodar was a coach of field hockey, basketball, softball and lacrosse at Muhlenberg from 1963 to 1990 and served as advisor to the 


cheerleaders before retiring in 1997. Her family established the award after she passed away in September 2003. 

Like was part of two Centennial Conference championship teams with the Mules and graduated as part of the winningest class in program history. She ranks 10th on the all-time
list with 195 career assists. A biology major, Like was named to the CC Academic Honor Roll all three years she was eligible.

Lauren Rutt of the field hockey team was named Muhlenberg’s Outstanding Athlete at the annual Lehigh Valley Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (LVAIAW) luncheon.

Rutt was a second-team All-South Region and first-team All-Centennial Conference selection in 2007. The Mules’ field leader from her central midfield position, 
she scored a career-high five goals, one of which came in overtime against 19th-ranked Gettysburg in the last game of the regular season to secure the third seed in the CC
playoffs.

Rutt, a three-time CC Academic Honor Roll selection as a Spanish major, finished her career with 33 points on 10 goals and 13 assists.

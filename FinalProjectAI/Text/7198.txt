Soccer Teams Fall, Men’s Golf Closes Fall Season


Men’s Soccer



Men’s soccer dropped its home finale to Johns Hopkins, 3-1. Despite the loss, the Mules (7-6-1, 2-3-1) are still just one game out of second place in the
tightly packed Centennial Conference.

Two of the 10 seniors honored before the game combined on the lone Muhlenberg goal late in the first half. After a free kick into the box was knocked back out, 
Brendan McIntyre played the ball to Jacob Joseph, who rocketed a shot into the side netting from a tight angle for his first goal of the
season. 

The Blue Jays (6-6-2, 3-2-1) regained the lead with less than four minutes to go in the half and added an insurance score in the second half.

Women’s Soccer



Women’s soccer suffered a 2-0 home loss to Gettysburg, one of the top defensive teams in Division III. The Bullets (11-1-3, 6-1-1) entered the day as one of
15 teams in the country that had allowed five or fewer goals on the season.

Muhlenberg (6-8-1, 4-4) remained a point ahead of Franklin & Marshall and Dickinson for the final playoff spot. The Mules have two Centennial
Conference matches remaining, against Ursinus (2-4-1) and Bryn Mawr (0-8).

Men’s Golf



The men’s golf team closed out its fall season at yesterday’s RU-Camden Scarlet Raptors Invitational. Without their top two players, the Mules came in fifth
out of nine teams.

Freshman John Froberg tied for fifth with a 7-over par 77.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams closed out the regular season with solid showings against a large field at the Gettysburg Invitational, the final tuneup for next month’s Centennial Conference Championships.

The men placed fourth out of 26 teams, while the women came in ninth of 27 squads just two weeks in advance of the conference meet. Junior Luke Munyan and sophomore Stephen Sroka (right) led the way for the men, finishing eighth and ninth, respectively, in a field of 281 runners, while sophomore Melanie Tramontina paced the women with a 19th-place showing on the flat and fast course.

Munyan has been the first Mule across the finish line in each of their four events this season. Freshman Jaryd Flank ran well for the men, placing 19th, and senior Bobby McGetrick finished 29th. Junior  Kenny Wohl (41st), senior co-captain Jarrett Felix (46th) and junior Josh Elkan (47th) rounded out the top seven for the Mules, who were coming off back-to-back team titles in the Muhlenberg Invitational and the Paul Short Run. Muhlenberg finished 60 points clear of fifth-place Salisbury and just four shy of third-place Shippensburg, one of five Division II schools in the meet.

Sophomore Claire Thornton was the second runner across for the women, who were competing without their top runner. Thornton wound 
up 48th in a field of 276 entrants. Junior Chelsea Rivenbark (58th) and senior Ramzy Burns (59th) finished back-to-back, and senior Lauren Zakheim (62nd) joined them in Muhlenberg’s top five. The Mule women were competing for the first time since winning the Muhlenberg Invitational nearly a month ago, as their leg of the Paul Short Run was cancelled due to excessive heat two weeks ago.

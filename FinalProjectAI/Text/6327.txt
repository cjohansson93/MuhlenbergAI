Tennis Teams Swept


The Muhlenberg tennis teams ran into Johns Hopkins squads ranked in the top 20 in Division III and were both swept, 9-0.

The men’s No. 1 doubles team of senior Jordan Rutt and sophomore Jason Teitelbaum played a competitive match with long rallies before falling, 8-4, in the closest match of the day. The Johns Hopkins men are ranked 16th in Division III.

The eighth-ranked Hopkins women extended their Centennial Conference winning streak to 57 with their 9-0 shutout. Despite the loss, the Mules (4-6, 4-4) got some help in the CC playoff race when Washington beat Gettysburg. Muhlenberg is currently tied for sixth in the league with road matches against McDaniel and Dickinson remaining.

The Muhlenberg baseball team took early leads in both games but could not hold on and was swept by Gettysburg, 13-8 and 9-3.

Freshman Chris Manfredonia broke the school record for longest hitting streak by hitting safely in both games. He went 2-for-6 in the opener, then singled on a 1-2 pitch in the top of the ninth of Game 2 to extend his streak to 18 games, topping the mark of 17 achieved twice previously, most recently in 1987.

In the opening game, the Mules (18-16, 2-10) scored four runs in the top of the first when senior Brian Beck hit a two-out, two-run triple, and the next batter, sophomore Nick Kennedy belted his third home run of the season.

The 4-0 lead stood up through the bottom of the first, but the Bullets (17-10, 6-6) scored in every inning after that, taking a 7-5 lead on a grand slam in the bottom of the fourth. Muhlenberg scored single runs in the fifth and sixth to close the gap to one before Gettysburg gave itself some breathing room with three in the bottom of the sixth.

Beck (right) finished a double short of the cycle, going 4-for-6, including his second home run of the season. Kennedy also had four hits, and junior John Muha was 3-for-4 with two walks.

Muhlenberg combined a double by senior Nick Busillo, a walk, a hit batsman, a sacrifice fly and a groundout to plate two runs in the top of the second of Game 2. The Bullets tied the score in the bottom of the inning, however, and blew the game open with a four-run sixth en route to sending the Mules to their eighth straight loss.

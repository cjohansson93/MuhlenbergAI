About American Studies

American Studies at Muhlenberg offers students the opportunity to study the culture and history of the United States from an interdisciplinary perspective. The four-course core requirement provides an introductory experience to influential ideas, events, and productions in the fields of literature, history, and political science, while the rest of the curriculum is self-designed, that is, the course work is chosen by majors themselves. To fulfill the requisite number of courses for graduation, students may select, in consultation with their advisor, from courses in Art, Business, English, Environmental Studies, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Religion, Sociology/Anthropology, or Theatre that focus on American experience. Students may choose to concentrate on a particular area of American Studies that engages their interest and imagination, such as Place and Space in America, Politics and Popular Culture, Immigration and Identity, Labor and the Arts, and Ethnic Studies. The interdisciplinarity of American Studies encourages independence and innovation, while at the same time providing a structured background in the literature, history and political culture of the United States.

track teams prep for cc meet


The Muhlenberg track and field teams tuned up for next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships by running at 
Haverford’s Keogh Invitational.

The best event for the Mules was the men’s mile, with senior David Chorney finishing fourth and three other runners –
sophomores Rob Nihen and Matt Lauletti and junior Patrick Thornton – running season-best times.

Senior Stuart Udis won the 800 with a season-best clocking, and junior Alex Faust took first in the pole vault. Junior
Jennifer Lynch placed second in both the 800 and mile, and sophomore Bobby Torphy was second in the 400.

Freshman Marc Brookland (right) came in fourth in the triple jump, landing within two inches of his best mark.

Muhlenberg Collegeâs masterâs level programs grow out of the College's deep grounding in the liberal arts and desire to express that grounding in masterâs and graduate certificate programs rooted in Muhlenberg's academic strengths. We are deeply committed to offering programs at a level of quality and rigor that brings value to our students and workforce. These new programs will serve an entirely new constituency: mid-career learners who are seeking to advance their education beyond the baccalaureate level either for personal or professional reasons. 
Innovative graduate certificate pathways allow students to exit with a specialized graduate certificate and return later, or continue on for a master's degree. An overall hybrid adult-learner model provides a balanced work-life-school schedule that emphasizes:

High touch personalized experience
Multiple certificate pathways to grad degree
The intersection of liberal arts & professional competencies (public speaking, teamwork, project management, ethical leadership, creativity, design, improvisation, quantitative reasoning, measuring change, collaboration, making connections, social and emotional intelligence, thinking globally and appreciating cultural diversity)
A professional-friendly inclusive entrance process
A community of professional development, inquiry, and learning

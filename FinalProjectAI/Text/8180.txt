The Muhlenberg College dance program celebrates its 20th anniversary with a special edition of its annual Master Choreographer dance concert, Feb. 6-8.
The concert will feature a restaging of D-Man in the Waters (Part 1), by legendary choreographer Bill T. Jones, as well as seven world-premiere dance pieces, choreographed by acclaimed guest artists and faculty members.
One of the premiere choreographers of his generation, Bill T. Jones was the recipient of the 2010 Kennedy Center Honors (alongside Paul McCartney and Oprah Winfrey). He has won Tony Awards for his choreography in the Broadway shows Spring Awakening (2007) and Fela! (2010). The Dance Heritage Coalition has called Jones “an irreplaceable dance treasure.” The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, founded in 1982, has performed worldwide.
Premiered in 1989, D-Man in the Waters won a New York Dance and Performance Award (“Bessie Award”) and has since become one of the company’s signature pieces. Set to Mendelssohn’s Octet for Strings in E-flat Major, Op. 20, the work is one of the finest examples of the post-modern aesthetic and was featured in PBS’s landmark film Dancing in the Light: Six Dances by African-American Choreographers.
"D-Man is the kind of piece that sets audiences cheering," Anna Kisselgoff wrote in the New York Times in 1989, and acclaimed dance director Charles L. Reinhart called the piece “one of the greatest works ever choreographed… It's extraordinarily moving emotionally and extraordinarily exciting and interesting choreographically with an incredible message of despair and hope which is what life's all about.”
D-Man in the Waters is supported by the Dexter F. and Dorothy H. Baker Artist-in-Residence program, and presented with the cooperation of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company.
The annual Master Choreographers concert features a diverse selection of styles and genres, ranging from classical ballet to contemporary jazz, modern dance, and tap accompanied by live jazz music.
“This concert presents a spectacular evening of dance,” says Karen Dearborn, founding director of Muhlenberg’s dance program, and the concert’s artistic director. “We are thrilled to showcase Bill T. Jones’ masterpiece, along with new works by internationally acclaimed guest artists and faculty.”
Dearborn has created a new work for the performance, which will also feature works by: Danish choreographer Charlotte Boye-Christensen, former artistic director of the Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company; Corrie Franz Cowart, co-artistic director of Co-Art Dance; Heidi Cruz-Austin, alumna of the Pennsylvania Ballet; Dorrell Martin, founder of LEON Dance Arts NY; Shelley Oliver, director of Shelley Oliver Tap Dancers; and Jeffrey Peterson, former dancer with Danny Buraczeski’s Jazzdance.
In conjunction with the Master Choreographers concert, dance critic, acclaimed author and journalist Elizabeth Zimmer will present a lecture on Friday, Feb. 7, at 5 p.m., in the Baker Center for the Arts Recital Hall. Admission is free.
Other 20th Anniversary activities include a Dance Reunion Weekend, March 21-22, and an Alumni Concert, featuring dance pieces by alumni from throughout the program’s 20 years, March 22.
Performances of Master Choreographers will take place Thursday, Feb. 6, at 8 p.m.; Friday, Feb. 7, at 8 p.m.; and Saturday, Feb. 8, at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for patrons 17 and under. Performances are in the Empie Theatre, in the Baker Center for the Arts, Muhlenberg College, 2400 Chew St., Allentown. Information and tickets are available at 484-664-3333 or muhlenberg.edu/dance.
Muhlenberg College is a liberal arts college of about 2,200 students in Allentown, Pa. The College offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in theater and dance. Princeton ranks Muhlenberg’s theater program first in the nation, and the Fiske Guide to Colleges lists both the theater and dance programs among the top small college programs in the United States. Muhlenberg is one of only eight colleges to be listed in Fiske for both theater and dance.

The College Art Collection is comprised of a wide array of objects including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography and other artifacts.  We are extremely grateful for the generosity shown to the College by philanthropists, alumni, individual artists and other community members who have donated works over the years.   These gifts are an important and inspiring part of cultural life on campus.  Works hang in offices and public spaces across campus, are used by students as objects of study, and are included in exhibitions in our galleries.  We welcome offers and donations of art in all mediums that meet collection criteria.  Because we have a duty to preserve and care for works in our collection, we use a committee structure to determine whether we can accession particular new works.  Unfortunately, we are often not able to accept items that need special care or storage, or have unique maintenance or display requirements.  In some cases we may be able to offer suggestions or referrals to institutions which may be more suited to care for an artifact with unique needs. 
If you are interested in donating an artwork, please contact Paul Nicholson, the Director of the Martin Art Gallery.  We are a non-commercial, educational space focused on our core mission of presenting creative research, and are unable to facilitate private sales, appraisals, authentication, or offer tax advice.  If you have questions on these matters, we would encourage you to consult an appropriate professional.

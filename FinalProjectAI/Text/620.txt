*The maximum number of courses (day or evening) a student may roster during each fall or spring semester is five courses. Students may roster up to two "day" courses during either the fall or spring semester (for a total of four). The maximum number of courses allowed during the summer session is two courses per session (for a total of four summer courses ).

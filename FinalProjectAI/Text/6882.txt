Muhlenberg got off to a good start in its home doubleheader against McDaniel, scoring a run after only two batters on a single by senior John Muha
and a double by sophomore Kurt Johnson. But that was the last time a Mule would cross home plate.

The Green Terror (15-9, 4-2) came back to take the opener, 2-1, and took the nightcap, 3-0.

The lack of offense negated outstanding starting pitching efforts from senior Rob Shannon and sophomore Matthew Lawsky. Shannon
pitched into the ninth inning and did not allow an earned run, while Lawsky allowed only two earned runs in 7 1/3 innings.

Muha had three hits in the doubleheader, pushing his season total to 52 and making him only the third player in team history to record back-to-back 50-hit seasons.

Washington, ranked ninth in Division III, scored off the opening faceoff eight seconds into the game, opened up an 8-1 lead after the first quarter and went on
to defeat Muhlenberg, 13-4.

Sophomore Adam Schlauch made a career-high 17 saves in a little more than three quarters. Sophomoe Jason Mertz had two goals and
an assist for the Mules (6-5, 2-2).

The Mules (5-5, 0-4) were tied with Washington, 4-4, midway through the first half, but the 20th-ranked Shorewomen pulled away for a 22-6 win.

Senior Molly Davin scored her 100th career goal in the first half, becoming the 11th player in team history to reach the century mark.

Sophomore Sharen Resnikoff came back from a 5-2 deficit in the third set to win at No. 4 singles, giving the Muhlenberg women’s tennis
team a dramatic 5-4 win at Washington.

The Mules, who evened their Centennial Conference record at 2-2 after an 0-2 start, trailed 2-1 after doubles but won four of six singles matches to defeat the Shorewomen in Chestertown for the first time since 2005.

Junior Gabriela Contino pulled Muhlenberg into a 4-4 tie by winning her No. 6 singles match, 6-0, 6-1. Contino also teamed up with senior
Amanda von Taube for an 8-1 win at No. 3 doubles.

Resnikoff (right) lost her first set 6-3 but won the second by the same score, setting the stage for the dramatic third set. She won the final five games
to achieve a comeback three-set victory for the second time in her career; the first helped the Mules to a similar 5-4 win against Franklin & Marshall last year.

Junior Emily Szulman and sophomore Jennifer Goldberg won in straight sets at No. 2 and No. 3 singles, respectively.

Washington has qualified for the CC playoffs in six of the last seven seasons.

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team was on the opposite side of a team comeback at Washington. The Mules won two of three doubles matches, but the Shoremen
took four singles matches for a 5-4 win.

Muhlenberg has never defeated Washington in men’s tennis. The closest of the previous 19 meetings was 7-2 in 2009; the three matches before this year were all 9-0
shutouts.

Sophomore Daniel Lakhman (No. 1 singles, No. 1 doubles) and junior Jason Teitelbaum (No. 2 doubles, No. 3 singles) were both
double winners for the Mules.

Senior Samantha Mayden posted the highest finish ever by a Muhlenberg cross country runner at the NCAA Championships, coming in 67th in a field of
277.

The previous best finish by a Mule was 94th by Will Elson in 2002. The former top finish by a Muhlenberg female was 127th by recent Hall of Fame inductee Karen Mount
in 2005. Last year, Mayden finished 195th in her first trip to the NCAA Championships.

Mayden’s finish was part of a big day for the Centennial Conference at the meet in Terre Haute, Ind. Johns Hopkins won the national championship, and five CC runners earned All-America honors.

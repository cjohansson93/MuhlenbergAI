Women's Lacrosse Hangs Tough with No. 6 Gettysburg
 Saturday, March 29, 2014 - page 2







					 



 


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team gave nationally ranked Gettysburg all it could handle, but fell behind after matching the Bullets blow for blow in the first half and suffered a 15-13 defeat.

Junior Stephanie Umbach led the way with six goals for her 13th consecutive hat trick dating back to last season for the Mules (6-3, 0-2). The first two came within 21 seconds of each other and jumpstarted a run of four unanswered goals that turned a 5-2 deficit into a lead with 6:29 remaining in the first half. But the two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Bullets, who came in ranked No. 6 in Division III, answered with just over a minute to play in the period to go into intermission tied at 6, then scored the first four and nine of the first 11 goals in the second half to pull away. 

The loss ended Muhlenberg’s school record-tying seven-game home winning streak. Though the Mules were unable to record their first-ever victory in the series, they did give the Bullets (7-1, 2-0) a rare battle; the winning margin had not been less than seven goals since 1994.

Despite the loss, the Mules’ offensive success helped them accomplish a rare feat. The 13 goals were the most ever scored by Muhlenberg in the series, and since 2003 only one other CC team has reached the 13-goal mark against Gettysburg. Three days earlier, the Bullets held 10th-ranked York to just four goals.

Senior Michelle Certosimo scored a goal and handed out three assists, two of them in a 5-0 closing spurt during the last minute of the game. The first went to Umbach, who broke an 18-minute scoring drought with her fifth goal at the 2:52 mark. That made it 15-9, and the score stayed that way until the Mules uncorked a late burst.

Freshman Nora Fisher cut the deficit to 15-10 with 54.3 seconds to play. Umbach’s final tally came 14 seconds after that, and junior Kayleigh Thies scored the second of her two goals just 11.3 ticks later. Sophomore Casey Armstrong found the back of the net with 14.3 seconds left to provide the final margin.

Senior Kaitlyn McCaffrey was all over the field on defense, causing a career-high six turnovers. That was one off the school record set in 1998 and matched in 2000, and equaled Umbach’s total in the victory over RIT two weeks ago. Before that, no Mule had come up with that many since 2004. McCaffrey (left) also scooped up a game-high six ground balls.

Freshman Kelsey Nagle scored her fourth goal of the season to give the Mules a 6-5 lead late in the first half.

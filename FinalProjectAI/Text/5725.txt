women’s basketball wins, with class


Lauren Boyle had to leave Muhlenberg’s game against Swarthmore after only 10 minutes to attend her 7:15 Landmarks of Modern Mathematics class. So while
she sat behind a desk learning about sets and Cantor’s theorem, her teammates on the 



Feldman’s alert follow-up of a missed fast-break layup gave Muhlenberg a 40-24 lead with 2:23 left in the first half.




women’s basketball team gave a lesson in balanced team play.

Going for most of the game without 
their leading scorer, the Mules defeated the Garnet, 74-64, for their fourth win in a row.

The subset of the team that attended Immaculate Heart Academy 
in New Jersey – sophomore 
Kaitlyn O’Malley and junior Kaitlin Strumph – both hit for career highs in points.

“We knew what the situation was coming in,” said O’Malley, who scored 16 points. “We all knew that we had to step up to make up for the points we’d be missing.”

Eleven players scored points for Muhlenberg (5-2, 3-1), compared to only six for Swarthmore (2-4, 1-2). Seven Mules scored between six and 16 points, ensuring that the team had offense no matter who was on the court.

Strumph scored 10 points and dished out three assists in her best game of the season. Senior Michelle Feldman added nine points, her most in three years, and junior Erin McSherry contributed eight points.

Senior Abra Like (seven points, four assists) and sophomore Maiza Mock (six points, six rebounds, two assists, three steals) also played strong all-around games.

Even those who didn’t put up big scoring numbers made big plays. Junior Bethany Enterline drew a charge with five minutes left, fouling out the Garnet’s top scorer and making a comeback unlikely.

Muhlenberg jumped out to an 11-2 advantage and led by as many as 16 points in the first half, during which it shot 47.6 percent and forced 17 turnovers while committing only four. Swarthmore scored the first six points of the second half to cut a 13-point deficit to seven, but Feldman hit a three-pointer a minute later, and the Mules kept their lead in double digits the rest of the way.

The win, combined with Dickinson’s loss to McDaniel, put Muhlenberg in a three-way tie for first in the Centennial Conference with Dickinson and Gettysburg. The Mules, who do not play another CC game until January 9, have recovered nicely from their league-opening loss to Gettysburg.

“We finally found the ‘Muhlenberg basketball’ that we were looking for and got into a rhythm that we like,” said O’Malley.

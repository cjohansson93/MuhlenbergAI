What does an usher do?
The department offers the chance to see all of our productions for free by becoming an usher. All are welcome; you do not need to have any connection to the department in order to be an usher. We do ask that ushers be over the age of 16. Usual usher duties include handing out programs, taking tickets, helping people find their seats, and other tasks. Friendly faces always encouraged!
We are using this new system to organize usher sign ups! We encourage you to sign up for an account when you are signing up for a slot, as that will allow you to easily change your sign ups in the future. It will also send an event to your ICal or Google calendar directly. You will be required to enter your name, your email address and your phone number when you sign up for a slot.
Before signing up to usher, please read the following information carefully.
Dress Code
All ushers must wear "dressy casual." No jeans, cut-offs, t-shirts, hats, etc. Closed-toe shoes are required. If you are unsure that your clothing will be acceptable, please contact Jess Bien beforehand. You may be sent home to change clothes if the House Manager deems it necessary.
Report Time
Ushers must report to the Box Office in the Trexler Pavilion 45 minutes before the scheduled performance time. Performance times vary, so please be sure you are looking at the right call time before you sign up!
Cancellation Policy
If you are unable to fulfill your usher commitment, you must cancel prior to 24 hours in advance of the performance by logging into your account and choosing to either delete your sign up or ask to swap with someone else.
If less than 24 hours prior to the performance, YOU MUST CALL THE BOX OFFICE DIRECTLY at 484.664.3333.
Failure to provide adequate cancelation time for an ushering spot will result in preventing you from signing up for future usher opportunities.

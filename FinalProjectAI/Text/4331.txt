Spring Teams Fall


The Muhlenberg men's lacrosse team suffered its second straight loss, falling at Montclair State, 9-5.

The Red Hawks, who made the NCAA Tournament last year, led 5-2 midway through the third quarter before the Mules came back. Sophomore Jack Reilly netted a man-up goal off a feed from junior Clint Watkins, and junior Chase Nadell scooped up the ensuing faceoff and scored 12 seconds later to make it 5-4.

Watkins' goal two minutes into the fourth quarter brought the Mules to within one again, at 6-5, but Montclair ran off the last three goals of the game.

Junior Nick Rispoli had a strong game in the "X", winning 10 of 12 faceoffs.

The Mules had three placewinners and finished seventh out of eight teams at the CC Championships. They scored 22.5 points to easily finish ahead of 



host Washington and Lee (6 points).

Junior John Sternlicht, who missed much of the CC dual-meet season with an injury, returned to place third at 165. After dropping his opening bout by 4-3 decision to the third seed and eventual runner-up, Sternlicht (right) went 3-0 with two pins (one in 16 seconds) in the consolation bracket. He decisioned the No. 2 seed, 10-9, in the consolation final.

Seniors Keith Swanson and Michael Slevin both finished their careers by coming in fourth. Seeded sixth at 157, Swanson scored a 4-0 win against the fourth seed to reach the consolation final, where he lost to the No. 2 seed. Swanson finished the season with a team-best 18-11 record.

Slevin placed fourth at 133 despite not winning a contested bout. He advanced to the consolation final on a medical forfeit.

Junior 149-pounder Kevin Homan posted Muhlenberg's biggest win in the championship bracket, defeating the No. 2 seed, 5-2. It was the third straight year that Homan knocked off the second seed.

wrestling drops pairduring impromptu CC tri-match



Quick wrestling geometry question: When does a quad become a tri-match? When icy roads prevent one team from getting to the gym.

That was the case Saturday as the Muhlenberg wrestling teams quad with Ursinus, McDaniel and Washington and Lee was turned into a tri-match when the Green Terror could not make it to Memorial Hall.

In Muhlenberg's opening match, the Mules won three of the five contested bouts but were not able to overcome the bonus points from a pair of Washington and Lee pins as the Generals pulled out a 24-21 win.

Senior Michael Slevin (right) put the Mules out front early with 7-2 decision at 133.

Holding a one-point lead through two periods, Slevin worked an escape and scored a takedown eight seconds into the third to stretch his advantage to 6-2 before he added the riding time point to give the Mules a 3-0 lead.

The Generals responded with a pin at 141 before junior Kevin Homan provided some of the most exciting action of the match at 149.

A quick flurry and scramble saw Homan earn a takedown, get reversed then score a reversal himself, all in the opening minute. The with the scored tied 4-4 after one, Homan rode his opponent for the entire second period to deny the escape and rack up what would prove to be vital riding time.


After giving up two back points early in the final period, Homan worked another reversal to retie the score. He then rode out the bout to earn a 7-6 win via riding time.

Then senior Keith Swanson scored two of his three takedowns in the first period and never relinquished control as he earned a workman-like 8-4 win at 157.

But the Generals earned another pin at 165 to mathematically clinch the match and the two teams traded forfeits the rest of the way.  

Muhlenberg dropped its second match of the day, 37-6, to Ursinus.

Swanson picked up the Mules' first win against the Bears with a 4-1 win. He scored four takedowns en route to a 2-0 day.

Junior Patrick Gibson (left) followed Swanson with a 9-4 victory at 165. Gibson was aggressive from the whistle and notched four takedowns to earn his first win since bumping up to 165.

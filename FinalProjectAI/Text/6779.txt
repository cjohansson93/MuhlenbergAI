Carnevale Seventh at ECAC Championships
 Friday, May 17, 2013







					 




Junior Stephanie Carnevale of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team placed seventh in the 100-meter hurdles at the ECAC Championships in her last chance to 
qualify for the NCAA Championships.

Carnevale, who entered the meet ranked 23rd on the Division III performance list, broke her own school record in the trials, crossing the finish line
in 14.65 seconds to improve slightly on the list. She clocked in at 14.72 in the final.

The NCAA awards bids to the top 22 declared athletes on the performance list. During the indoor season, Carnevale got in to the NCAAs as the last qualifier
and earned All-America honors by finishing seventh.

Carnevale and other Mule hopefuls Tyler Bauer (javelin) and Samantha Mayden (5,000 meters) will find out this weekend
if they have made the field for nationals.

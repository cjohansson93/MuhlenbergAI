Basketball Teams Among Statistical Leaders


Both Muhlenberg basketball teams are among the NCAA Division III statistical leaders through games of January 6.

The women are one of only 15 teams in Division III with more assists than turnovers. They are 10th in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.02), and freshman
Kelly McKeon is 14th individually in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.26), with 43 assists and only 19 turnovers. The Mules are tied for 18th in fewest turnovers
per game (15.6).

Junior Lauren Boyle is 33rd in free-throw percentage (.862).

The men’s team appears in the top 40 in two defensive categories: 36th in scoring defense (62.6 points per game) and 39th in field-goal percentage defense
(.398). In addition to playing tough defense, Muhlenberg is used to seeing it from its opponents. The Mules have already faced two teams that are ranked higher in
scoring defense (Haverford, seventh, and DeSales, 19th) and will face a third when they welcome McDaniel (24th with 60.2 points per game) for the second game of tomorrow’s
doubleheader.





Junior Rob Kein of the Muhlenberg wrestling team is eighth in Division III at 149 pounds in the National Wrestling Coaches Association rankings released today.

Kein, a national qualifier last year, jumped into the rankings after winning the Williams Invitational on Saturday. He was named Most Outstanding Wrestler for the
second time in his career, with one of his wins coming against a nationally ranked opponent from Ithaca.

Kein is tied for the team lead in wins with a 15-3 record. He leads the Mules in takedowns (50) and near-falls (seven).

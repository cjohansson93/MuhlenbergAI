Director, Choreographer, Theatre Teacher, and Business Owner





Christine Barclay '07 was the director of the remarkable production of SPRING AWAKENING described in this NY Times article. The production ran last month in Boca Raton, Florida, about 10 miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school, and featured Never Again cofounder Cameron Kasky as Melchior.
The show was a production of Christine's BARCLAY Performing Arts, which she founded in 2016. After graduation, she worked in New York as a director, choreographer, performer, and teacher at a variety of venues, including the Looking Glass Theatre and The Broadway Workshop.
Christine moved to Florida in 2012 to work with the nationally acclaimed StarStruck Academy & Theatre, as a director, choreographer, ad acting instructor. You can read more about her accomplishments and Barclay Performing Arts on their website, barclayperformingarts.com

Men's Soccer Ties, Women's Soccer Falls in CC Road Action

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team extended its season-opening undefeated streak to eight with a 1-1 tie at Gettysburg.

The Mules (6-0-2, 1-0-1) took an early lead in the ninth minute when senior Travis Wantchekon (right) blasted the
ball from the top of the box inside the far post for his fourth goal of the season. The Bullets (7-1-1, 1-0-1), whose only previous blemish was a loss to top-ranked Messiah,
tied the game early in the second half.

Both teams had chances to win in the last minute of overtime. Senior Danny Pinto saved a header with under
40 seconds to play, and a Muhlenberg shot went just wide at the final horn.

The contest began a stretch of three games in seven days against regionally ranked Centennial Conference opponents for the
Mules, who are ranked third in the region and 21st nationally by the NSCAA. Muhlenberg hosts 25th-ranked Swarthmore on
Tuesday before traveling to top-10 Franklin & Marshall on Friday.

last 35 CC regular-season games.

Freshman Rachel Mizrahi kept the Mules (6-2-1, 2-1) within striking distance, making a career-high 10 saves, 
including several at point-blank range.

Baseball, Men's Tennis Fall in Conference Action
 Thursday, April 5, 2012







					 




The Muhlenberg baseball team had its streak of Centennial Conference series splits snapped with an 8-2 loss to Haverford.

The Fords (13-12, 5-1) used a six-run third inning to go up 7-0 before the Mules finally got on the board in the sixth when junior John Muha drove in sophomore Brett Rosen with an RBI groundout and junior Joseph Vila plated freshman Chris Manfredonia with a line-drive single to center.

But the Mules (18-10, 2-4) were limited to just two hits the rest of the way, and Haverford added an insurance run in the seventh. 

The Fords were on the verge of tacking on some more insurance after loading the bases with one out in the eight, but sophomore Pat Doolittle (left) came in and struck out Haverford’s three and four hitters to get out of the inning.

The Muhlenberg men’s tennis team fell on the Battlefield, 7-1 to Gettysburg.

Sophomore Ben Berkowitz (right) battled back after dropping the first set to pick up the Mules’ lone point by winning the third set, 10-8, at No. 4 singles for his first victory of the Spring. Freshman
Daniel Lakhman won his second set 7-6 (7-2) and was headed to a third at No. 2 singles when the match was called because of darkness.

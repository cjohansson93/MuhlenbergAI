Men's Basketball Posts Up-Lifting Scotty Wood Tournament Win
 Friday, November 18, 2011







					 


 Women’s basketball


Hunter Forsman was sitting at the scorer’s table waiting to check in to the Muhlenberg men’s basketball game against SUNY Cobleskill when someone in the stands yelled, “Hunter, have you been lifting?,” prompting a smile from the junior forward.

“That was Evan Tozer and Steve Cavanaugh, just joking around,” said Forsman, referring to 



Curry had seven points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal during the 26-3 run.


two seniors on last year’s team. “They know I like to spend time in the weight room.”

Forsman did his share of lifting in the game, and he had plenty of partners as the Mules advanced to the Scotty Wood Tournament championship game with a 100-73 win.

Muhlenberg (2-0) will go for its second straight title against Immaculata, which overcame a 13-point deficit to knock off Moravian, 82-76.

The Mules reached the century mark for the first time in four years (since a 107-37 Scotty Wood win against Philadelphia Biblical) with an outstanding all-around effort. Reigning Scotty Wood MVP Spencer Liddic made a strong opening case to repeat, putting up game highs of 25 points and 14 rebounds. Sophomore Austin Curry scored 15 of his 17 points in the first half.

A pair of freshmen also hit double figures, with AJ Dean scoring 11  and Patrick Hanafin 10. Dean flirted with a triple-double, adding eight rebounds and six assists. A third freshman, Gabriel Mercer, netted nine points.

And then there was Forsman, whose first two seasons at Muhlenberg 
were curtailed by injuries. He had a near double-double with career highs of nine points and nine rebounds, making all four of his field-goal tries – including a pair of dunks.

“My first two college dunks,” he said. “They’re great; they really get the crowd going. I’m glad to get the first two under my belt, and hopefully I’ll get some more tomorrow and help us win a championship.”

It wasn’t a dunk, but a layup by Hanafin, that got the Mules going. The Tigers used some long-distance three-point shooting to forge an 18-all tie midway through the first half, but Hanafin’s layup kicked off a 26-3 run that put Muhlenberg in command. Liddic scored 10 points during the run.

The Mules shot 54.1 percent in the first half, scoring 53 points in the first 20 minutes, and hit the century mark on Hanafin’s three-pointer with 1:25 left.

“That was the first time a lot of us have been part of a 100-point game,” said Forsman. “It was amazing.”

And if Muhlenberg continues the way it’s going, more amazing nights can be expected.

“We have a whole new style this year. The focus is on pushing the ball, getting it up the court quickly, and from there getting good shots,” said Forsman. “It’s up-tempo and it’s fun to play in.

“And of course it’s fun to score 100 points.”

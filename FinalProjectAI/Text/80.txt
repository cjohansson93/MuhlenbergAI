Descriptions & Content Notices:
MEDEA
Medea is a wife, mother, witch, and queen. For the sake of her husband, Jason, she has left her home and borne two sons in exile. But when he abandons his family for a new life, Medea faces banishment and separation from her children. Cornered, she begs for one day's grace. It's time enough. She exacts revenge and destroys everything she holds dear, in order to reclaim the person that she once was.
This production includes depictions of murder, grief, blood, and infanticide, and mentions of sex.
A NUMBER
A Number is a psychological thriller that surrounds the topic of identity and family. The conflict surrounds Salter and three of his sons, two of which are clones of the first. The play looks deeper into the effects of nature versus nurture and neglect.
This production includes profanity and discussion of murder and suicide.
THE SCARLET VERSE
Complete with unexpected companionship, a mad doctor, an ensemble of gothic narrators, and a mysterious photo album, the story of The Scarlet Verse combines tragedy with comedy, ancestry with new beginnings, and the strength of love with the calamity of blind faith. The musical was initially written in the fall of 2018 by Danny Milkis â23, and went under the original title Alone in Paris. After its initial production at the For All Theatre Laboratory in July of 2019, it was selected for presentation in Muhlenbergâs 2020 Audio Fringe Festival, but was sadly cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a number of workshops and revisions, the show has re-emerged, attempting to ask questions about belief in a higher power, the manifestations of oneâs darkest fears, the secrets behind Genesis 22:1-19, and the power of an unexpected human connection.
This production includes mention of torture, depiction of death, and smoking.
WAKE
Shocked by the recent death of their mutual friend, a down-on-their-luck stoner and their persnickety ex-girlfriend get much more than they bargained for when they seek answers about what happened. Wake is a story of friendship, growing pains, and whatâs worth saying before itâs too late.
This production includes themes of suicide and depression and depiction of drug use.

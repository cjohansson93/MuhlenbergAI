Playing against a more experienced Johns Hopkins team in the Centennial Conference championship match, the Muhlenberg volleyball team played well in the middle two sets but struggled in the first and fourth and was defeated, 3-1.

The Mules end their season with a record of 20-12 and as CC runners-up just three years after finishing in a tie for last place. The Blue Jays (14-12) won their third straight title and will represent the CC in the NCAA Tournament.

Hopkins jumped out to an 11-3 lead in the first set and breezed to a 25-11 win. Muhlenberg regrouped in the second set, however, extending a 10-8 lead to 13-8 on three straight service aces by sophomore Joanne Josephson. The Blue Jays closed to within 15-14 before the Mules ran off six consecutive points behind the serving of sophomore Chelsea Kaser.

A kill by sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller closed out the set at 25-21 and tied the match at one apiece.

Muhlenberg took the momentum into the third set, opening up an early 9-4 lead. Hopkins came back to tie, and the score stayed close the rest of the way. The Mules led 20-19 before the Blue Jays scored the next four points to take control. Down 24-21, Muhlenberg fought off two match points on kills by Kaser and junior Lindsey Gambocurta, but Hopkins scored the next point to take a 2-1 lead in the match.

The Blue Jays led from start to finish in the fourth set, finishing off the match with a 25-10 win.

Josephson (right) had eight kills and four blocks to go along with her three aces. Allison Glass also recorded eight kills to become only the second Muhlenberg freshman with 300 in a season.

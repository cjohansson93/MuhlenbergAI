Accounting Program
Major Requirements:
In order to declare and remain an accounting major in good standing, a student must achieve and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.000 in courses applicable to the major. Major requirements must be taken at Muhlenberg unless prior written permission is obtained from the department chair or accounting coordinator. Students majoring in accounting cannot take accounting, business, economics, or finance courses on a pass/fail basis. Because of the many special options and programs available to accounting majors, all students should carefully plan their programs in consultation with their faculty advisor to make sure that they meet graduation requirements and, if applicable, state CPA licensing or graduate program requirements.
A major in accounting must complete 12 courses as outlined below:
Required Courses: ECN 101 Principles of Macroeconomics ECN 102 Principles of Microeconomics ACT 101 Financial Accounting ACT 201 Accounting Information Systems ACT 224 Cost/Managerial Accounting ACT 320 Intermediate Accounting I ACT 322 or 323 Intermediate Accounting II Accounting / 71 ACT 326 Concepts of Federal Taxation ACT 490 CUE: Auditing & Assurance Services MTH 119 Statistical Analysis OR MTH 331 Mathematical Statistics I AND MTH 332 Mathematical Statistics II
Elective Courses (choose two): ACT 330 Advanced Accounting ACT 334 Fraud Examination BUS 225 Business Law I BUS 226 Business Law II BUS 236 Management BUS 239 Marketing ECN 332 or 333 Public Finance FIN 237 Corporation Finance FIN 330 Monetary Economics FIN 490 CUE: Advanced Topics in Financial Management Although there are no prescribed combinations of electives, students should choose electives only after close consultation with their faculty advisor. Electives can and should be enrolled with some specific objective in mind. Certain graduate programs and career paths may require that the student take more than the 12 courses specified above to be adequately prepared to enter the program or profession. Internship opportunities are also available to accounting majors although they do not count toward the major requirements.

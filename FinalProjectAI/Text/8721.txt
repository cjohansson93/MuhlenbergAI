Muhlenberg will now be offering direct deposit to student employment. 
Here is what you need to do and what you need to be aware of:

Return a completed direct deposit form  with the additional completed employment paperwork.  Check with your banking institution to verify the correct account numbers. 
The first paycheck after you turn in your completed form will be in the form of a conventional paper check.  Direct deposit will take effect in the second payroll, provided you have supplied the correct account numbers. 
Direct deposit adds an additional step in the processing of payroll.  In order to keep the pay date in a reasonable time frame, your time sheet must be received in the Controller’s Office with ALL information and signatures.
Time sheets received in the Controller’s Office after the due date or with missing information will not be processed and will be returned to the department for the next pay date.

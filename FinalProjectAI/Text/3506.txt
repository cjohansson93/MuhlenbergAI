Rice, Saucier sweep weekly track and field honors






After of pair of impressive performances, the Muhlenberg men's and women's track and field teams claimed both of the Centennial Conference's weekly awards.

For the second week in a row, junior Peter Rice was named the men's athlete of the week after he posted another record-breaking performance. 

Rice set a new CC mark in the indoor 400 meters with his time of 48.67 at the NYU Challenge. The time provisionally qualified Rice for the NCAA Championships and broke the old CC record of 48.90 set in 2003. After applying the conversion for a banked track, Rice's time of 49.17 is the sixth-fastest in Division III this season. 

The school record holder in both the 200 and 400 meters, Rice owns the top CC times in both events this winter. He is also ranked second in the 55 meters.

Freshman Erin Saucier grabbed the women's weekly award after posting a pair of wins in the pole vault. 

On Wednesday, Saucier took first at the Haverford Quad Meet with a height of 9-10.5. Three days later, she cleared a personal-best 10-6 to win the event at the NYU Challenge. 

Saucier, who is only the second Mule woman ever to go higher than 10 feet, equaled the highest mark in the CC this season with her effort in New York.

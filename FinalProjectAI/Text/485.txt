The Particular Past

Martin Art Gallery: The Particular Past, In the Galleria Space: 2.14 â 5.20, Opening Reception 2.14 5 â 6:30pm
Featuring works from the collection, and works by Tom Bendtsen, Foeiqua, Sharka Hyland, Andrew E. Johnson, Bang Geul Han, Donald Porcaro, Jessica Posner, Jessica Walker, curated by Martin Art Gallery Director Paul M. Nicholson
The Particular Past explores the spaces between knowledge and belief.  By rewriting and reimagining past and present, these artists embody our political and cultural moment where expertise, truth, and even the past are malleable.  Shifting between witness and advocate, these artists alternately illuminate and gaslight their way through a conversation on the value of knowledge. 
We are in a time where ideology trumps truth, all evidence is suspect, and social and institutional trust seem like notions of the past.   In this moment of seemingly capricious truth, The Particular Past does not acquiesce and ebb toward postmodernity, but embraces open discussion.   Artists in this exhibition demonstrate the tension between deities and defiance through objects, ideas, and experiences helps us come to terms with this moment of radical social and political change.  In an effort to understand this epic shift in ho we see the world, this exhibition functions as an act of collective introspection.
Jessica Walker and Jessica Posner interrogate historical narratives through a subversive cultural lens, employing stereotypes to survey the body politic.   Layered constructions by Tom Bendtsen and Donald Porcaro intermingle foundations of knowledge with the fundamentals of civilization.   Manicured forms create structures that act as architectonic talismans of paper and stone.
Sharka Hyland presents visions of America through pencil drawings that explore how literary language transcends the distinction between the verbal and the visual. Bang Geul Han projects a more jarring reality through her 2017 piece Through the Gaps Between My Teeth, which deconstructs the transcript from President Trumpâs Access Hollywood tape, using his transgressive words in a generative animation that reassembles the text to form accounts of sexual assault posted on Twitter.
Andrew Ellis Johnsonâs Strewn shows pigs in a field of books, rooting around, eating, lounging in a muddy library.  Johnson notes about this piece that âIn fiction, swine have acted as agents of both revolution and repression; in reality, they have been agents of anti-intellectualism. During Pol Potâs regime in Cambodia, the National Library was used as a stable and piggery. Its books fueled cooking fires, their pages rolled for cigarette papers. â¦ The uneducated were glorified - as they are in other countries today.â
Works in The Particular Past question the broader implications of our actions and attitudes toward truth and justice.  Looking to the past for inspiration, these artists work within a critical framework that aspires to an ethical, just, and self-aware humanism rooted in democratic principles.

Don Porcaro synthesizes form and content in his Talisman series (2012 â present), where deposits of shaped stone and brass form enigmatic sentinels. The incised and stacked rock strata results in something that is both familiar but mysterious. Porcaroâs stylized forms, complete with feet, a âbodyâ, and topped with an array of polished brass of uncertain utility result in something the feels like a combination of history and culture. Employing rock formed over millennia, then shaped into a ritualistic monument, the artist forces us to contemplate whether this is a credible historical artifact or a new article capable of divination.Layered constructions by Tom Bendtsen and Donald Porcaro intermingle foundations of knowledge with the fundamentals of civilization. Manicured forms create structures that act as architectonic talismans of paper and stone.

Tom BendtsenConversation #6, 20188332 books, coal, mushrooms
In his earlier Argument series (1995 â 2003), Bendtsen combined form and order through architectonic book stacking to create monuments to arguments. Arguments employed obsessive ordering by subject, as history was indexed spatially.
In his more recent Conversations (2004 â present), structures have focused on surface image, disregarding subject. TheseConversations use book spine color as physical pixel to focus on over-all image.  Indexing by color creates unexpected connections between books, as subject and title is left to chance.  A detective novel abuts a text on accounting, sharing onlycover color in common. These radical juxtapositions make for a kind of three-dimensional flarf poetry.  In Bendtsenâs work however, there is no cutting or pasting, as books are stacked without adhesive, bound together only by gravity.  Tomes become an essential building block; that his structures are unsecured makes them inherently fragile, preserving the potential for collapse.
 

Jessica PosnerVENUS, 2017Butter and beeswax over carved, plastered foam form
Posnerâs VENUS uses the The Venus of Willendorf (an 11.1-centimeter-tall Venus figurine est. 28,000 - 25,000 BCE.) as a point of departure to discuss contemporary issues of body image, acceptance, and objectification of women. Taking this Paleolithic sculpture and its anthropological and art historical significance into account, Posner uses butter as a metaphor for the body politic. Posner createdVENUS in 2017 as a part of a larger series exploring structural violence against feminine subjects.

Hylandâs drawings present visions of Americaâ the land as well as the idea. In texts spanning a century and a half, American writers encounter the American landscape as a spiritual presence.Sharka Hyland and Bang Geul Hanâs pieces share a unique engagement with text and language, but stand in stark contrast to one another. Hylandâs meticulously rendered hand-drawn text explores visions of America that are are open-ended, uplifting and optimistic. In contrast, Hanâs projected text algorithm facilitates our collective recall of a public injustice. 
Hyland is interested in how literary language transcends the distinction between the verbal and the visual. Many of the images we remember have no physical existence. They are evoked by the words of great writers and created in our mind as we read. Each image is unique, brought into being as we integrate the authorâs words into our individual life experience. These complex images exist only in the readerâs mind; the text is their only material form.  Hylandâs hand drawn texts use historically and culturally appropriate typefaces, in a size and format one might encounter while reading a book. The conjured image is the subject of the drawing.3
3. Text provided by the artist, works lent courtesy of the artist and Gallery Joe
Han's generative animation deconstructs the letters constituting the transcript of President Trumpâs Access Hollywood tape and briefly reassembles the letters to form accounts of sexual assault posted on Twitter. The deliberate limitation (every Tweet has to be reconstructed using only the letters in D.J.T.âs remarks) leaves imperfections in the text, alluding to the cultural and structural constraints involved in speaking on such subject matter. 4
This dystopian call and response played out publicly on social media in the waning months before the 2016 election. With digital memory standing in for corporeal memory, Han evokes the collective re- traumatization that occurs when we fail to hold the powerful accountable for their many transgressions.

Jessica WalkerThe White Crayon, 2008Wax crayons, paper labels, ed. of 3

Walker uses the dark history of Crayolaâs infamous âFleshâ1 colored crayon as a point of departure for her colorful and provocative workThe White Crayon (2008). Her piece explores stereotypes, labels, and personal and institutional power using the parody brand, Raceola. In this alternate universe, white crayons are given color names based on derogative slang for poor or rural Caucasian [white] communities.  Keeping her intention deliberately ambiguous, Walker anticipates the inflammatory All Lives Matter response to the Black Lives Matter movement, where questions of compassion and oppressed/oppressor are ironically inverted and tried in the court of public opinion. Owing to her upbringing in rural Virginia, Walker treads a fine line in this questionably sympathetic portrayal of the struggles that economically left behind communities endure. 
1. Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith Crayola company produced
their âFlesh Tintâ crayon from 1903 â 1949, and as "Flesh" from
1949â1956, and 1958â1962; this line is now produced under the
color name âpeachâ.

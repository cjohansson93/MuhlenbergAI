Football Team, Flank Earn Bids to National Championships

On the same day the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team advanced to the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA 
Division III Tourmament, one Mule team and one Mule individual found out that they too would get to 
compete in the national championships.

The Muhlenberg football team received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament and 
will play at Widener in a first-round game on Saturday, November 22. 
Sophomore Jaryd Flank earned a spot in the NCAA Cross Country Championships, to be held on 
Saturday in Mason, Ohio (hosted by Wilmington College).

The Mules, ranked 24th in Division III by the American Football Coaches Association, will be making their 
seventh appearance in the NCAA Tournament and their 11th postseason appearance in the last 15 years. Muhlenberg 
is 2-6 all-time in the NCAA Tournament, winning first-round games in 2002 and 2007. The Mules were eliminated by 
Wesley in each of their previous three trips, most recently in 2010, but Wesley is in a different bracket this year.

Widener (10-0) won the Middle Atlantic Conference championship and is ranked 10th by the AFCA and 11th by D3football.com.  The Pride is 17-11 in the NCAA Tournament, including national championships in 1977 and 1981.  


Muhlenberg and Widener have not met in football since 1982.

In cross country, Flank was on the bubble after earning all-region honors by finishing 14th at 
yesterday’s NCAA Mideast Regional. He would have been out of the nationals field if the NCAA selected only 
three teams from the Mideast Region, but the NCAA took four. Individual bids are awarded to the highest finishers among non-qualifying teams.

Flank has finished in the top 20 in all seven of his races this year, winning the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg 
Invitational.

This is the 10th straight year that Muhlenberg has sent at least one runner to the NCAA Championships in cross country.

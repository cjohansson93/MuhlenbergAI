Baseball Beaten in Ninth


In a back-and-forth baseball game that featured four lead changes, Eastern struck the final blow, scoring three runs in the bottom of the ninth for a 10-9 win in Muhlenbergs first non-conference game in almost a month.

The Mules (14-17) trailed 3-0 before senior Dan Fisher ignited the offense with an opposite-field home run, his first of the year, leading off the fifth. Muhlenberg added another run that inning and scored four in the sixth, two on a single by junior Jeff Puklin, to go ahead 6-4.

Eastern scored twice in the bottom of the sixth to tie and reclaimed the lead on an unearned run in the bottom of the seventh.

With one out in the top of the eighth, junior Joseph DiCecilia launched a ball that hit the top of a tree behind the left-field fence, putting Muhlenberg ahead 8-7. It was the eighth home run of the season for DiCecilia.

The Mules added an insurance run in the ninth when freshman John Muhas fourth single of the game brought in Fisher, who had doubled. But the 
Eagles (17-12) pieced together an error, four walks and a walkoff single for the winning rally, dropping the Mules to 3-6 in one-run games.

DiCecilia went 3-for-3 with four RBI and has now reached base in 11 straight plate appearances. Senior Eric Pomroy also had three hits, as the top four players in the order combined for 12 of Muhlenbergs 16 hits.

The Muhlenberg mens tennis team played its closest match of the season but couldnt bring its losing skid to an end.




The Mules (3-7) fell, 5-4, to local rival Moravian, coming just three games short of pulling out the win.

Those three games came at third singles. After dropping the first set, 6-4, senior Matt Kral cruised in the second set, 6-1. As the third set got underway the rest of the singles matches were completed with the dual match tied at 4-all.

Kral was serving with the match tied at 3-all but was broken. Moravians Drew Shreter then took the next two games to give the Greyhounds (6-5) the victory.

With his younger brother, a Moravian sophomore, just one court over each time, senior Mark Apostolos (left) dropped just one game in a No. 5 singles win and paired with classmate Yoni Farber for an 8-6 victory at No. 3 doubles. Junior Wayne Mitchel won 6-0, 6-2 at fourth singles, and sophomore Jordan Rutt won by retirement at first singles.

The Matte Award now stands 11½-5½ in favor of Muhlenberg with just one contest, mens golf, remaining.

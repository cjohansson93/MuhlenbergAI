Basketball Teams Fall in 2014 Debuts; Curry Scores 1,000th

The Muhlenberg basketball teams returned from three-week layoffs to disappointing results in their final non-conference games of the season, with the men dropping a 96-82 decision to King’s and the women falling, 81-56, at undefeated Elizabethtown.

The men led 46-39 with 15 minutes to play in their first action since the PNC Royal Rumble championship at Scranton on December 17, but the Monarchs (6-6),
 who made just 23.7 percent of their shots in the first half, shot 63.3 percent in the second en route to
 snapping the Mules’ eight-game home winning streak dating back to last season.

Senior co-captain Austin Curry netted a team-high 18 points for Muhlenberg (8-3), giving him an even 1,000 for his career. Curry reached the milestone on a driving layup with 
1:16 remaining, becoming the second Mule to do so this season. Junior Malique Killing surpassed the mark in the second game of the year.

Curry (right) eclipsed his season average of 8.4 points by halftime, by which he had helped the Mules to a 37-33 advantage with a game-high 10 points. He made all four of his free throws in the 
second half and knocked down a baseline jumper before becoming the 34th player in program history to hit the mark.

Sophomore Alec Stavetski joined Killing with 15 points in a physical contest that featured 57 fouls and 80 free-throw attempts. Senior Brandon Bovino contributed nine points and a team-high seven rebounds, while sophomore Nick Melosky matched a career high with seven points and grabbed six boards.

The women, meanwhile, struggled to get anything going against an Elizabethtown squad that landed one spot outside the top 25 in the latest D3hoops.com poll and looked the part in improving to 9-0.

Senior Leeann Lanza led the way with 10 points for the Mules (5-5), who shot just over 25 percent from the field and committed 22 turnovers. Junior Nicole Pepe and sophomore Christina Santone chipped in nine points apiece.

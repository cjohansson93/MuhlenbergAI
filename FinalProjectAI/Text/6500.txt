Women's Soccer Earns Home Playoff Game with 1-0 Win
 Saturday, October 27, 2012 - page 2







					 


Freshman Nicole Karsch may have forgotten her jersey, but she sure didn’t forget the importance of the game for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team.




Junior Susan Galgano and the rest of the Muhlenberg defense allowed only three goals in 10 CC games. The only team to score more than one goal against the Mules since
the first game of the season is top-ranked Messiah.



“I opened my game bag and my [No. 2] jersey was not in there tonight, so I had to wear the extra one. I guess wearing No. 30 worked out pretty well though,” laughed Karsch. 

Karsch scored the lone goal, her second of the season, in the 40th minute of a 1-0 victory over Ursinus. Junior Krissy Fioretti had the assist as she lofted a corner kick to Karsch, who was waiting on the far side of the box. Karsch settled the ball and floated it into the near side of the goal.

The win gave the Mules (8-8-2, 6-3-1) a berth in the Centennial Conference playoffs. They tied Swarthmore for fourth place and will host the Garnet in a first-round game by virtue of their head-to-head win.

The game at Ursinus was a must-win game for the Mules, as a loss or tie would end their season.

“After our loss against Moravian, we told ourselves that we had three days of practice and we needed to show up and work as hard as we could because this game was it. It was do-or-die,” said Karsch. “That’s been our motto all season, but we realized that it really applied to this game tonight.

“I think the pressure of this game really pushed us. We were so excited to come out and show them what we had.”

Muhlenberg dominated the tempo throughout the first half, outshooting Ursinus 11-2. Overall, the Mules held a 17-5 shot advantage over the Bears (3-9-4, 0-6-4) and a 6-2 edge in corner kicks.

Freshman Francesca Cobuzzi made four saves for Muhlenberg to record the shutout, her sixth of the season. The Mules have now played 15 consecutive games ending in shutouts. The last time both Muhlenberg and its opponent scored a goal was in its third game of the season, a 1-1 tie at Montclair State.

“Everyone was so supportive of one another tonight,” added Karsch. “Before the game we said, ‘Let’s play for each other. Everyone wants to go to the playoffs just as badly as you do, so do it for the person standing next to you on the field.’”

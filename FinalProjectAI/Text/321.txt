Join the Muhlenberg Team for the Runner's World Half and Festival
Runners (and walkers) of Muhlenberg, unite!
Meghan Kitaânew(ish) writer in the office of communications, brand new member of the Employee Wellness Committee and former editor at Runner's World was able to work her extensive running connections to get a very special deal* for you all: 15 percent off any of the Runner's World Half & Festival races (October 19-21 in Bethlehem).
That's 15 percent off the 5K (3.1 miles), 10K (6.2 miles), half-marathon (13.1 miles) and 3.8-mile trail race, or any of the combination events (5K and 10K! 5K, 10K and half! Or all four!). 
Use the code MUHLENBERG when you register at rwhalf.com.
If you don't run or run-walk but you like to make your loved ones do it, the weekend also offers free runs for kids and dogs. You still need to register at rwhalf.com.
If you don't currently run or run-walk but would like to try a 5K, email Meghan with your story about why youâd like to complete your first 5K this October for a chance to win a FREE 5K entry!
When you register for any of these events, select "Join a Team" and then choose Team Muhlenberg from the dropdown menu.
Team Muhlenberg members get... 


A free training plan for their race distance of choice


Emails about training runs/run-walks and other related events happening on or around campus before race day


Access to the Team Muhlenberg tent on race weekend


The chance to win a signed copy of Meghan Kita's book of running tips, How To Make Yourself Poop and 999 Other Tips All Runners Should Know (if you register on or before August 31)

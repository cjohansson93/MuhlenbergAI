same time, next year:
field hockey upsets hopkins again



“It’s a weird kind of rivalry,” said Muhlenberg field hockey player Amanda DiMarco of her team’s encounters with Johns Hopkins.

From the Mules’ standpoint, that’s weird in a good way.

For the second year in a row, Muhlenberg defeated a 




Cohn assisted Notarianni on both of her overtime goals this year. She is tied for sixth in team history with 13 career assists.



Johns Hopkins team that was ranked in the top 10 in Division III, getting a goal from senior Nicki Notarianni with 5:17 left in the second overtime period to win, 1-0.

The Blue Jays (10-3, 5-2) entered the game ranked 10th. Last year, they were ranked No. 6 before coming to Allentown, where the Mules scored 32 seconds into the first overtime.

Senior Tara Cohn was involved in both winning goals, scoring it in 2008 and assisting on it this year. She slipped the ball past a defender about 15 yards from goal to the left of the goalie. The goalie came out to challenge, and Cohn slid ball into the circle.  Notarianni was all alone and one-timed it home for her second double-overtime winner of the season.

“It was a tough game. It just came down to heart,” said DeMarco. “We wanted it really bad.”

The Mules (8-5, 4-3) also needed it really bad to get back into the Centennial Conference playoff picture. After losing three straight home games, the team has responded with two straight wins and is now tied in the loss column with three other teams for fifth place in the CC standings. Muhlenberg plays road games against Franklin & Marshall and Bryn Mawr, who are a combined 2-13, before closing out at home against nationally ranked Gettysburg.

The last of those three straight home losses, last Saturday to McDaniel, came after the Mules lost two of their three seniors to injuries. “It’s always rough to lose your seniors at the most important part of our season,” admitted DiMarco. “We definitely stepped it up after that game. We had really good practices this week.”

Cohn, one of the seniors, returned for the Hopkins game, but at the start it looked like she might not make a difference. The Blue Jays dominated the first half, owning a 13-3 advantage in shots. But freshman Kristen Dornenburg made five of her 11 saves in the half and the defense held tough, keeping Hopkins off the board.

The second half and overtimes were more even, with Hopkins taking 11 shots to nine for Muhlenberg. DiMarco helped send the game into overtime by making a defensive save with less than two minutes to play in regulation.

“That was kind of crazy,” she said. “I don’t really remember it; everything was happening so fast, it was just ‘get the ball out!’ It felt good to make a play like that. Whenever anyone makes a key play it gets everyone pumped up.”

Nothing got the team more pumped up than the winning goal, which moved Notarianni into a tie for sixth on the program’s all-time list with 31 career goals. The win was the fifth for the Mules against Hopkins, but their first ever in Baltimore. 

“Our team has built a lot of confidence,” said DiMarco. “Right now we’re feeling good.”

fantastic start for track teams





Chorney raced a smart mile, sitting in behind the pace-setters and making his move when they ran out of gas.



The Muhlenberg track and field teams had an excellent opening day at the Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by Ursinus.

The Mules brought home three gold medals, and the men ended the first day tied for second place, while the women were fifth, just four points from 



Torphy’s outstanding split in the 800 gave Chorney a sizable cushion in the DMR.



third place.

Senior David Chorney contributed to two of the golds, the first two of his indoor career. He won the mile in 4:15.40, setting a school record and meeting 
the NCAA provisional standard. He also anchored the distance-medley relay 
team that took first place, finishing up the work started by senior Stuart Udis, junior Brendan Kirk and sophomore Bobby Torphy.

Kirk also earned a silver medal with the 4x200 relay that clocked in at 1:33.72, a half-second off the school record, and qualified for the final in the 55-meter high hurdles.

The women’s gold medalist was no surprise – junior Alex Faust won the pole 

vault for the third year in a row, breaking her own meet record with a vault of 11-1/4 . After winning the event, Faust attempted to hit the NCAA automatic standard. On her third and final try, she hit the mat with the bar wobbling precariously, and it ultimately fell off. Faust came into the meet eighth on the Division III 



Freshman Jenna Schaffer ran on the 4x200 team and qualified for the 55-meter final with the third-fastest performance (7.65 seconds) in school history. 




ranked performance list.

Junior Jennifer Lynch nearly qualified provisionally for the NCAAs in the mile, finishing fifth in a talented field. She crossed the line in 5:06.61, more than eight seconds faster than her previous best; the provisional standard is 5:05.00. Lynch also anchored the fourth-place DMR team.

Sophomore Lindsey Weidmann placed in two events on the first day as well, tying for sixth in the pole vault and running on the
4x200-meter relay team that came in 
fourth, less than a second off the school record.

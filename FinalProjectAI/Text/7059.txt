Soccer: Women Play Their Way into Playoffs, Men Just Miss

The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team saved its best offensive performance of the season for the final game, and the timing couldn’t have been better: With a 4-0 win against Bryn Mawr, the Mules clinched their ninth Centennial Conference playoff berth in the 13 years the league has hosted a postseason tournament.



The Muhlenberg men’s team did all it could, winning its regular-season finale at McDaniel, 1-0. The Mules got the help they needed from three of the other four games, but not the fourth. Franklin & Marshall scored with 2:11 left to beat Swarthmore, 2-1, and shut Muhlenberg out of the CC playoffs.

The women will travel to McDaniel on Tuesday (corrected 11/3) for a first-round playoff game. The Mules (7-10-1, 5-5) won the regular-season meeting with the Green Terror, 1-0, back on September 14 in the first CC game of the season for both teams.

That win started a stretch of 13 straight games, which carried into the regular-season finale, in which Muhlenberg did not score more than one goal. And the Mules started slowly against the Owls (2-15, 0-10) despite controlling play for most of the first half. Finally, senior CJ Graetzer broke the ice on a shot from the top of the box with 1:01 left in the first half, and that opened the floodgates.

Muhlenberg added three more goals in the second half. Sophomore Jacelin Muschlitz netted her second goal of the season off a pass from junior and former high school teammate Colleen Touhey, and Graetzer made it 3-0 with her second goal of the game and sixth of the season.



Touhey (right) capped the scoring with her second goal of the season with 8:14 left, assisted by sophomore Gabriela De Frutos.

The four goals were twice as many as the Mules had scored in any game this year. Bryn Mawr attempted only one shot as three of the four seniors honored along with Graetzer prior to the game – backs Stephanie Tramutola and Susan Galgano and goalie Amanda Wong – contributed to Muhlenberg’s eighth shutout of the season. After giving way in goal to sophomore Nicole Gioe for the second half, Wong saw some time as a field player.

In a game marred by an altercation and three red cards, the men scored their lone goal in the 72nd minute when junior Joey Roberts (left) converted a pass from classmate Lance Dotzman. Junior Danny Pinto and senior Jas Chojnowski combined for the shutout in goal.

The Mules (9-7-1, 4-4-1) finished in sixth place, a point behind fifth-place Johns Hopkins for the final playoff spot. 
The scoreboard watching came down to the final game of the day. After getting needed wins from Dickinson and Ursinus and a tie from Johns Hopkins,
Muhlenberg needed a Swarthmore win at Franklin & Marshall to earn a playoff berth. Things looked promising when the Garnet tied the game with about five minutes to play,
but the Diplomats won on a late PK.

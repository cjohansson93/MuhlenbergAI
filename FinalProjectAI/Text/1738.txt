Details
The Library Instruction Room (B-01) is a multi-purpose facility that is used primarily for instructional sessions by the library staff. It contains a projection device, and a podium with a computer, a sound system, DVD Player, and a VCR. Other uses are permitted on a lower priority basis.
Uses

B-01 can be used in the following ways. Uses are listed in priority order:

Instruction by reference librarians. The highest priority is to use this facility as a training area for instructional programs of the library.
Open student study space. When not used in any of the above ways, this facility is available as a student space. Students must leave the facility prior to a scheduled training class. No student will be permitted to stay in the room during a training class.
Other occasional academic uses are permitted on a lower priority basis, especially later in the semester after the heaviest period of library instruction has passed



Scheduling
The Public Outreach & Information Literacy Services Department will coordinate the scheduling of this room and post a schedule for the room each morning. As noted above, there is some opportunity for faculty to use this room for teaching on an irregular basis. Faculty must contact a Reference Librarian to use B-01; staff will discuss what the faculty member needs and how best to meet those needs. The Reference Librarian will schedule the room for the faculty member after this consultation has taken place. Scheduling for faculty uses must be done at least 24 hours in advance but no more than one week in advance.
Hours of Operation
B-01 is open during the hours that the library is open.
Contingencies
These guidelines may be modified at any time at the discretion of the Head of Public Outreach & Information Literacy Services Department.

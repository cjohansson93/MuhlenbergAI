McDonough, Hartzell Earn All-Region Recognition
 Monday, December 5, 2011 - page 2







					 


Seniors Patrick McDonough and Chris Hartzell of the Muhlenberg football team were named to the D3football.com All-South Region team.


McDonough was a first-team selection for the second year in a row, while Hartzell was selected to the third team.

McDonough (left), a preseason All-American and three-time All-Centennial Conference first-team selection, led the CC with 104 tackles, including nine 
tackles for loss and 5½ sacks. The inside
linebacker had some of his best games in the biggest games, recording a career-high 16 tackles against CC champion Johns Hopkins and 14 against another team that was ranked in the top 10 in Division III,
Delaware Valley. The first Mule in 16 years to reach triple digits in tackles in back-to-back seasons, he finished his career with 333 tackles (third on the all-time list), including 189 solo (second). 


Hartzell (right) led the CC in interceptions per game and passes defended per game. The cornerback picked off four passes, one of which he returned 34 yards for a touchdown against Moravian, 
and led Muhlenberg with five pass breakups. He also recorded 27 tackles (22 solo), forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. Hartzell finished his career with 
10 interceptions and tied for sixth on the Mules’ all-time list with 20 pass breakups. 

McDonough and Hartzell both served as team captains and were leaders of a defense that allowed fewer than 20 points and 300 yards per game for the 11th consecutive season.
Heading into this weekend’s national semifinals, the Mules (7-3) rank in the top 40 in Division III in six defensive categories: ninth in scoring defense,
10th in sacks, 13th in turnover margin, 19th in rushing defense, 36th in total defense and 40th in pass efficiency defense.

2020: Pennsylvania Voter Views on Election Processes and Security
September 2020
A Report from the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO)
By: Chris Borick, Director MCIPOAuroni Hashim, MCIPO Student Director
INTRODUCTION
With less than 2 months remaining until Election Day, Pennsylvania is in the national spotlight as one of the key swing states that may decide the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. This election comes in the midst of an historic pandemic, threats of foreign interference in the election, and a number of significant changes in the ways that Pennsylvanians can cast their vote this fall. The confluence of Pennsylvaniaâs key role in the election, and the interest and uncertainty that surrounds the voting process and rules in the Commonwealth, increases the importance of understanding the views and concerns that Pennsylvania voters maintain about their 2020 vote. To help provide insight into these views, the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) has asked voters in Pennsylvania their perceptions of state preparedness for the 2020 election, and their primary concerns regarding election security and fairness in this cycle. These voter perceptions were gathered in surveys conducted in February and August of 2020, and serve as the data source for the following report.

SECTION ONE: VIEWS ON PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION PREPAREDNESS
As national, and even international attention towards the 2020 election in Pennsylvania grows, questions regarding the stateâs preparedness to conduct the much anticipated election are often asked. Is the Commonwealth prepared to provide a safe and secure election? Can Pennsylvania ensure accurate and timely delivery of election results? Perception of these matters is particularly important among Keystone State voters who will engage in this yearâs election. What is their level of confidence in the stateâs election preparedness, and what are their concerns about the voting process?
Over the course of 2020, views on Pennsylvaniaâs election preparedness have remained largely stable between February and August, with most Pennsylvania voters indicating the state is prepared to deliver a safe and secure election this November. A majority of respondents in both February (54%) and August (55%) reported that the state is prepared for the upcoming election, with only about 1 in 5 voters in February and August reporting the state is not prepared in terms of this role.  Notably, about a quarter of voters in the Commonwealth, in both 2020 polls, are unsure of the stateâs preparedness to deliver a safe and secure election later this year. (See Table One below.)

While views on the preparedness of the state for the 2020 election are not dramatically different across partisan divides, there have been some modest changes between February and March. In particular, there was a 13-point drop (20% to 7%) between February and August in the number of Republicans who believe Pennsylvania is very prepared for the election, and a corresponding 8-point jump (1% to 9%) in the number of Republicans who think the state is ânot prepared at allâ for the November election. (See Table Two below.)

SECTION TWO:  VIEWS ON MAJOR THREATS TO ELECTION SECURITY AND LEGITIMACY
Since the 2016 presidential election, attention to election security has risen in the United States. Investigations of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, public debates over voter suppression, voting machinery malfunctions, and claims of voter fraud by high profile political figures has elevated the profile of election processes as the country moves towards the November election. Thus, measuring perceptions of voting security and legitimacy among Pennsylvania voters has become an increased priority for the MCIPO this year.
 When Pennsylvanians were asked about threats to election security and legitimacy in February, responses were evenly distributed across three perceived threats: voting machines malfunctioning (22%), voter fraud (25%), and suppression of individuals from voting (21%). However, by August, the majority of responses were split between voter fraud (39%) and suppression of individuals from voting (30%). (See Table Three below.)

Partisanship has increasingly influenced views on major threats to election security and legitimacy over the course of 2020. In particular, the gap between Democrats and Republicans in terms of the biggest threat to the upcoming election has significantly grown between August and September. For Democrats, suppression of voters was most commonly identified as the biggest threat to election security and legitimacy in both February and April, but the percentage choosing this option rose from 29% to 49% over that six-month period. Among Republicans, voter fraud was identified as the major threat to the accuracy and legitimacy of this yearâs election in both the February and August polls, but nearly doubled from 36% in February to 68% in August.

Over the course of the summer, debates around the security of voting by mail grew in intensity in Pennsylvania, and around the nation. President Trump has regularly claimed that large scale voting by mail increases the chances of fraud, and has argued that access to this means of voting should be limited. With this debate as a backdrop, we tested Pennsylvania voter perceptions of the impact of large-scale voting by mail on the likelihood of election fraud occurring. The results in Table Five show high levels of division among Pennsylvania voters on the impact of large-scale mail voting on election fraud, with 47% agreeing, and 46% disagreeing that if most Pennsylvanians vote by mail the chances of election fraud will be greater.

The partisan divides that permeate so much of electoral politics are on full display regarding the potential of fraud caused by large-scale mail voting. Keystone State Republicans overwhelmingly (75%) agree that substantial mail voting in the state increases the probability of election fraud, with a mere 4% strongly disagreeing with the claim. The stateâs Democrats hold nearly opposite views on this matter, with 7 out of 10 either âsomewhatâ or âstronglyâ disagreeing that if most Pennsylvanians vote by mail the risk of fraud rises, with only about 1 in 10 (11%) strongly agreeing with the claim. Registered independents are fairly divided on the matter with 48% agreeing, and 41% disagreeing that significant mail voting elevates the chances of election fraud. (See Table Six below)

SECTION THREE:   VIEWS ON VOTER SAFETY
As individuals vote in the 2020 presidential election, they will do so in the midst of the largest pandemic to hit the United States since 1918. With Pennsylvanians adjusting to many aspects of their lives in response to COVID-19, voting in the 2020 election is also being impacted. In 2019, Pennsylvania adopted electoral reforms that expanded the ability of voters to vote by mail without having to meet the requirements for an absentee ballot. In the 2020 primary election in Pennsylvania, the confluence of the easier access to mail-in ballots, and the COVID-19 pandemic, helped increase mail-in ballots from 84,000 absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary, to about 1.5 million this year. 
As the general election nears, itâs valuable to get a measure of how safe Pennsylvanians feel voting in person, and how this view on safety may overlay with intended methods of voting. When asked in our August poll about their level of agreement with the statement, âAs of today, I do not feel safe voting in person,â the majority of Pennsylvanians indicated that they somewhat disagree (31%) or strongly disagree (42%) with this claim. Only about a quarter (23%) of Pennsylvanians agreed that they did not feel safe voting in person. (See Table Seven Below)

As seen throughout this report, views on voter safety have a partisan bent. When looking at the data for Democrat, Republican and independent voters, Republicans were most likely to âstrongly disagreeâ that âthey do not feel safe voting,â with 55% of GOP voters offering this response.  Comparatively, only about 3 out of 10 (29%) Democrats, and under half (46%) of independents maintained the same view.

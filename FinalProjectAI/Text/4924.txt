 Track & field honor



women join men in top 10, statistically




The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team has been ranked in the top 10 in two statistical categories the entire season. The Mules currently are third


in rebound margin, at a plus-9.8, and seventh in field-goal percentage defense, at .372. In rebound margin, the Mules trail only Guilford, the top-ranked
team in Division III, and Gordon.

The men have company in the top 10 from two players on the women’s team who have surged ahead with their outstanding play of late.

Junior Kelly McKeon (left) was seventh in assist-to-turnover ratio through Sunday’s games. Her ratio of 2.17 rose to 2.27 after her
six-assist, one-turnover performance against Dickinson last night. McKeon, who was ninth in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio last year,
has 27 assists and only six turnovers in her last five games. None of the six players who rank ahead of McKeon have as high a scoring average (13.6 points per game)
as she does.

Sophomore Alexandra Chili (right) was sixth in three-pointers per game (3.24). Like McKeon, she finished in the top 10 in that category
last year (third), and she also improved her average to 3.28 by making four threes in the Dickinson game. Chili has averaged 4.43 threes while shooting
48.4 percent from three-point land in the last seven games. Now the leading scorer in the Centennial Conference, averaging 18.1 points per game, Chili
needs four three-pointers to move into second place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

Standard & Poor's Affirms Muhlenberg's A+ Rating


Standard & Poor's Ratings Services affirmed its 'A+' rating, with a stable outlook, on Lehigh County General Purpose Authority, Pa.'s college revenue bonds, issued for Muhlenberg College.


	 Tuesday, October 4, 2016  09:19 AM

The rating reflects Standard & Poor's opinion of the College's strong management team—including new leadership in the form of President John I. Williams, Jr.—as well as the College's strategic planning process, control of costs and budgets, reasonable level of debt, excellent operations, stable enrollment and success within a competitive market.
"I am delighted that Standard & Poor's has reviewed Muhlenberg College's operations from stem to stern and given us an A+," said John I. Williams, Jr., President. "This independent recognition inspires all of us who work at and/or support Muhlenberg to move forward with confidence we are on the right track."
"Standard & Poor's recognition of the continued success of Muhlenberg College in a number of key areas and the affirmation of our rating with a stable outlook is pleasing to see," said Kent Dyer, chief business officer and treasurer at the College.
Last year's A+ rating reflected Standard & Poor's positive opinion of the College's strong financial resource ratios, history of consistently strong operating margins, moderately selective demand profile, above-average student quality and experienced management team.

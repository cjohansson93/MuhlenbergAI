Staged in the various rooms of Muhlenbergâs Hoffman House, âYou Are Cordially Invitedâ follows the mysterious Crowlin family and their fantastical soiree. Last yearâs guests couldnât stop talking about it â but it seemed too surreal to be true. Was it all a fantasy? Thatâs for the audience to find out. 
 âThere are 13 different stories happening from 13 different characters,â says the showâs director, Sarah Levine â22. The show becomes a kind of eclectic choose-your-own-adventure for the audience, in which they can interact with different characters. 
 âYouâre in the house with us,â Levine says. âYou get to see what you want to see â or what you happen to see.â 
 âYou Are Cordially Invitedâ is a devised piece: the cast and production team started with a basic premise and have been working together to turn it into a fully realized framework. The story takes its final shape once the audience joins the party. 
 âIt's going to be action almost everywhere,â Levine says. âWhat you choose to follow, where you choose to go, who you watch, who you listen to, is all up to you. Some of it's up to chance.â
 The story itself will have to remain a mystery for the moment; Levine wouldnât give too much away. 
 âItâs âKnives Outâ meets âClueâ with a little bit of âAlice in Wonderland,ââ she says. âThe idea for this show comes from a very childish fantasy of being able to step into another world.â 
 âYou Are Cordially Invitedâ premieres March 3-5, 2022, at the Hoffman House, Muhlenberg College. Showtimes are March 3 at 7pm, March 4 at 5 and 7pm, and March 5 at 4 and 7pm. Tickets are $15, with a campus price of $8 for students, faculty and staff of LVAIC institutions. Tickets and information at 484-664-3333 or available online.

men’s soccer escapes trap, upsets tcnj


There was plenty of flag-waving at Varsity Field for the men’s soccer match between Muhlenberg and The College of New Jersey, and it had nothing to do with the upcoming elections.

Rubin has scored two goals in the last four games, all Muhlenberg wins.




for offside nine times, the Mules defeated the seventh-ranked Lions, 2-1, in their final non-conference game of the season.

The win was the first for Muhlenberg (9-3) against a top-10 team since a 4-2 win against No. 9 Johns Hopkins in 2005. TCNJ’s only previous losses were to a pair of fellow top-10 teams in York and Messiah.

“They were stepping up a lot for the offside trap, and they got us a few times,” said sophomore Eric Miller, who was involved in both Mule goals.

When Muhlenberg beat the trap, it repeatedly used its quickness to generate scoring opportunities. The first came a little more than five minutes in, when 
junior Billy Dalton played a long ball to classmate Brendan Carroll, streaking down the middle. The Lion goalie came far out to challenge Carroll, who played the ball off to Miller for an open shot at the empty net.

Miller almost tacked on a second goal in the 19th minute, but his conversion of a free kick was disallowed by an offside call.

New Jersey (10-3-3) tied the score with less than five minutes to play in the first half.  Muhlenberg struck quickly again in the second half, for a second time taking advantage of its speed and the aggressiveness of the Lion goalie.

The winning goal was set up by freshman Mike Williams, who made a run in the middle of the field before laying the ball off to Miller on his right. Miller’s shot 
from the top of the box deflected off the charging goalie and right to freshman Evan Rubin, who tapped the ball into the net.

The Mules continued to attack after taking the 2-1 lead, with Miller and Dalton both hitting the crossbar in the last 30 minutes. The Lions had two good chances to 
tie, but senior Karim Assous cleared the ball off the line on a corner kick in the 70th minute, and a minute later senior Peter Bennett made a diving save on a close-range header.

“This game shows that we can beat anyone when we work hard,” said Miller, who took over the team scoring lead with 10 points with his three against TCNJ.

Muhlenberg College Digital Repository



Library Home|Special Collections|Digital Repository






The Muhlenberg College Digital Repository contains a significant portion of the scholarly and creative output of our community. The works incorporated here range across many disciplines, representing various types: journal articles, conference proceedings, books and book chapters, as well as theatre, fiction, sculpture, choreography and more. Because of copyright restrictions, and given that the repository is completely open to the public, some metadata is necessarily unaccompanied by an artifact. Where possible, though, an artifact has been included: writings, musical scores, photographs, or other digital objects to represent the work in part or in its entirety. Submissions are welcome from current Muhlenberg affiliates at any time of the year, using this form. Please address any questions about the repository to Kelly Cannon, Scholarly Communication Librarian, at kellycannon@muhlenberg.edu.

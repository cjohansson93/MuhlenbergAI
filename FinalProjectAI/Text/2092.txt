Personal Background

I am originally from Media, Pennsylvania, about half an hour outside of Philadelphia. I received my B.S. with honors in Biological Sciences from Stanford University. Afterwards, I worked as the Life Sciences Intern at The Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco. I moved to Ithaca, New York where I worked as a laboratory technician at Cornell University, working first on induced resistance in tomatoes and later on defense in marine invertebrates, especially echinoderm larvae. I entered graduate school at Cornell University and received my Ph.D. in January 2002. My thesis investigated the behavioral ecology of feeding in a marine snail. Most of my research was performed subtidally (underwater, using SCUBA equipment) at the Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) in the San Juan Islands, near Seattle, Washington.  I still often perform research at FHL during the summer, and have brought a number of Muhlenberg students out there to do research with me.  For information about the Friday Harbor Laboratories, click here.
After receiving my doctorate (Ph.D.), I taught for one year in the Biology Department at The College of Wooster and I also (on my breaks) worked as an Undersea Specialist, guiding ecotours in Baja California and southeast Alaska with Lindblad Expeditions.  These two regions of the world are amazing.  Ask me more about them if you are looking for an awesome place to visit and learn a lot about some unusual ecology and ecosystems!  I joined Muhlenberg Collegeâs Biology Department in 2003.
 

Research Interests

I study the ecology of invertebrates, with a particular focus on symbiotic interactions and feeding and defense in marine invertebrates. I use an understanding of the present-day ecology of organisms to shed light on evolutionary questions.   My summer research often occurs at sites near the Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL), on San Juan Island, Washington State, and I have brought Muhlenberg students out to FHL to perform research with me.  For one major set of my projects, I am examining epibiotic snails that live on other organisms.  How species-specific are these symbiotic interactions, why choose one host over another, and what sorts of benefits and costs are incurred by the epibionts and hosts?  Much of my recent work has involved the snail Crepidula adunca, which mostly specializes on the top snail Calliostoma ligatum in the San Juan Islands.  I am also fascinated by suspension-feeding snails (Crepidula spp. Feed in this manner).  These snails collect food from the water column, usually by trapping food particles on their gill.  Water needs to travel over the gill anyway so that the snail can obtain oxygen, and the food particles in non-suspension feeding snails are rejected as waste.  Why not eat those scrumptious morsels?  This is exactly how most bivalves (clams, oysters, scallops, also in the Phylum Mollusca) feed.  Yet comparatively few aquatic snails feed in this way, even though this feeding mode is thought to have evolved multiple times.  Why?  No one knowsâbut I enjoy contemplating this as I study suspension feeding snails (such a Crepidula spp. and Trichotropis spp.).On-campus, projects in my lab also involve defense strategies of fresh water (stream and pond) insects and snails.  I am particularly interested in inducible defenses: defenses that are deployed only when the prey receives a specific cue from a predator.  Otherwise, the prey remains undefended.  Such inducible defenses might be behavioral, but I am more interested in structural, morphological changes that occur, especially when a prey is faced with cues from various potential predators that forage in different ways.  No one individual can do everything, so how does a prey prioritize which defense to deploy?
If you are a student interested in the behavior or ecology of aquatic invertebrates, stop by and let's discuss some of your ideas, interests and possible future programs you might want to investigate.

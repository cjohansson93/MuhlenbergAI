          Am I a traditional full-time transfer student?
  








The Office of Admissions works with transfer students (from the ages of 18-23) who are applying to become traditional, full-time students on campus.
If you are a part-time student or full-time adult (over the age of 23) student, please contact our School of Continuing Studies at continuingstudies@muhlenberg.edu or 484-664-3300.






          What are the transfer application deadlines? When will I be notified of an admissions decision? 
  








The application deadline for students applying to the fall semester is June 15. For students applying to the spring semester, the deadline is December 10. 
Once all required application materials are received, transfer applicants should expect an admissions decision within two to three weeks. We begin notifying students on a rolling basis following the below schedule: 

Fall Semester: Notifications begin in early March 
Spring Semester: Notifications begin in early December 

 






          How will my current college credits transfer? 
  








If you are strongly considering transferring to Muhlenberg, you may request a review of your college course work to determine how your classes would transfer to Muhlenberg. To make this request, please send a complete list of classes along with their course descriptions to transfer@muhlenberg.edu. Your courses will be reviewed by our Registrarâs office and we will provide you with a transfer credit evaluation.  Accepted students are also encouraged to provide a list of course descriptions to begin the matriculation process. 






          What do we look for in a transfer applicant?
  








We review all applications holistically. Important factors include maintaining good academic progress at your current institution (the average GPA of admitted students is 3.0), character, and potential to contribute to our community in meaningful ways.






          What types of financial aid are available for transfer students?
  








We offer merit scholarships and need-based financial aid (determined by completing the FAFSA and the Muhlenberg Aid & Scholarship application).
All accepted transfer students in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society (PTK) are awarded a $15,000 per year merit scholarship.
Talent scholarships are available by audition or portfolio submission, and we offer other types of financial assistance. Transfer applicants applying for need-based financial aid can view the instructions here.






          What are the housing options on campus?
  








Housing is guaranteed for all students and is required for all incoming transfer students, unless they are commuting to the college. For additional questions about housing, please visit our housing & residence life website or contact 484-664-3180.






          What are some resources available to transfer students?
  








Two members of our admissions staff are dedicated to assisting transfer applicants. Before beginning classes, transfer students participate in an orientation program specifically designed for their transition from another institution. Each student is also paired with an academic advisor who will guide them through the process of registering for classes. 






          How can transfer students get involved on campus?
  








Muhlenberg is a vibrant, friendly campus community. Students have options to participate in over 120 clubs and organizations that include athletics, the performing arts, Greek life, religious life and community engagement. We have an ambitious student body that is always finding new ways to get involved!
We invite you to see our campus and connect with us through one of our visit options.

Toward Diversity: Black Experiences at Muhlenberg College, 1925 - 2021February 15, 6:30 p.m. - 8 p.m.Zoom (details to follow)
A group of Muhlenberg faculty and students have been diligently looking through archives and conducting interviews to piece together a robust history of the experiences of Black students, faculty and staff at Muhlenberg; their fight for equity; and the ways that their love for Black communities undergirded that fight. They have created a website that documents their findings, and this event will celebrate the public launch of this website.
Join the Africana Studies Program as we engage in conversation with the project creators and several Black alumni from the 1970s to debut the website and discuss the experiences of Black communities at Muhlenberg over the past 50 years.

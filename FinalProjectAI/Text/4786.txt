Senior Matthew Schroeder and junior Mike Horowitz of the Muhlenberg mens lacrosse team received All-Centennial Conference honorable mention.

A team captain, Schroeder (right) anchored a defense that allowed the third-fewest goals in the CC. He started all 13 games and picked up 46 ground balls, tops on the team and the fourth-highest single-season total in school history. He also caused 17 turnovers and assisted on one goal offensively. 

Schroeder ended his career with 138 ground balls, fifth-most all-time at Muhlenberg.

Horowitz (left) started all 13 games in goal and posted an 8.71 goals-against average and .582 save percentage. Those numbers improved to 8.55 and .611 in CC games.

Horowitz led the league in save percentage and was second in saves per game in conference action. He made double-digit saves in eight of the Mules 13 games, including 26 against Franklin & Marshall, the most by a CC goalie since 2005.

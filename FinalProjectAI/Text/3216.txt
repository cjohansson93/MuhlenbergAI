Five Muhlenberg student-athletes – four from the football team and one from the volleyball team – were voted to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District II 
College Division team, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America. 

District II College Division consists of all NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, NAIA and two-year colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To be nominated for the team, a student-athlete must be at least a sophomore with a 3.30 cumulative grade-point

average and a starter or significant reserve on his or her team. 

The four football players were all first-team selections and will advance to the national ballot for Academic All-America consideration.

Senior running back John DeLuca was named to the Academic All-District first team for the second year in a row. An accounting major, DeLuca is the eighth-leading 
rusher in Division III, averaging 156.8 yards per game. He ranks second in school history and seventh in CC history with 3,661 career rushing yards
and needs 457 yards to break the school record.

Joining him on the first team were senior wide receiver Joe Caporoso, senior center Mike Nolan and junior defensive end Jake Floyd.

A double major in media and communication and political science, Caporoso is the second-leading receiver on the Mules with 21 catches for 250 yards and three touchdowns.
Nolan, a double major in business administration and media and communication, was a preseason All-American and one of the keys to the Muhlenberg offense, which averages a 
CC-leading 33.8 points per game. Floyd, a finance major and double minor in political science and entrepreneurial studies, is second on the Mules and tied for fourth in
the CC with 8.5 tackles for loss.

In non-academic news, the undefeated Mules dipped to No. 3 in the American Football Coaches Association poll, 
No. 6 in the D3Football.com poll and No. 2 in the 
NCAA regional rankings. 

Making the Academic All-District third team for volleyball was senior Danielle Losonci. A Spanish major and business administration minor, she was third on the 
Mules with an average of 2.62 digs per set in 2008 and finished her career 14th on the program’s all-time list with 716 career digs.

football blanks juniata for first cc win


For the third year in a row, the Muhlenberg football team’s defense told the Juniata offense “nothing doing.”

The Mules allowed only 145 total 



Ryan’s interceptions were the first two of his career. Juniata threw only one interception in the first five games of the season but was picked three times by
the Mules.



yards, forced six turnovers and blocked a punt in defeating Juniata, 14-0, for their first Centennial Conference win of the season.

Since the Eagles joined the CC in 2007, they have not scored an offensive touchdown against Muhlenberg. The Mules won 44-3 two years ago and 38-7 last season, with the touchdown coming on a kickoff return.

Senior Jake Floyd led the defense, which held Juniata to minus-5 yards 




Liparini caught four balls for 27 yards, including his first career touchdown.



rushing, with 2½ sacks and two forced fumbles. Junior Andy Curley had eight tackles, a half-sack and a fumble recovery. 
 
The Eagles (0-6, 0-4) went three-and-out on the first series of the game, and freshman Dan Deighan blocked the punt to set the Mules (2-3, 1-2) up on the Juniata 21. That drive would end with a missed field goal, but Muhlenberg got excellent field position again when sophomore Chris Hartzell intercepted a pass on the third play of the next series.
 
Five plays later, sophomore Justin Myers hit wide-open tight end Steve Liparini in the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown.

Myers, making his first career start, threw for 135 yards and both touchdowns.

The Mules ended the next Juniata series when Floyd forced and recovered a fumble, but a bad snap on a field goal attempt prevented Muhlenberg from adding to its lead.

Muhlenberg took the opening kickoff of the second half and marched 78 yards in 12 plays for the second score. Senior Phil Cresta caught three passes for 31 yards on the drive, including a 4-yard reception for his 17th career touchdown.

Juniata’s best chance to get on the board came late in the fourth quarter. Aided by two personal foul penalties, Juniata advanced to the 7-yard line, but on third-and-goal sophomore Kevin Ryan picked off a pass. Ryan ended Juniata’s final drive with another pick.

Junior Joe Montemurro rushed for a career-high 75-yards on 12 carries. Cresta caught seven balls for 86 yards.

The shutout was the fifth for the Mules in the last three years.

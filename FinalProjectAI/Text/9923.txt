September 15, 2020 - The Choirs and the Music Department hosted Melissa Dunphy (composer) and Phillip Cheah (conductor) for a discussion about their recent world premier, Set Myself Free, a choral work written in commemoration of the 19th Amendment and the continued struggles women face in modern society. The discussion covered a variety of topics, including the experience of Women in Composition, how to create meaningful art during Covid, and how diversity impacts the field of classical music.

desales holds off mulesin men’s basketball clash





The DeSales men’s basketball team took a 36-33 lead with a three-pointer at the first-half buzzer and held on the entire second half to beat Muhlenberg, 67-59.

Both teams started off cold on an unseasonably warm January day. The score was 3-0 Mules after almost six minutes of play before the pace began to pick up. 
Muhlenberg tied the score at 33 on a layup by senior Obi Nwizugbo with 37.5 seconds to play, but Darnell Braswell drilled a three as time expired.

The Bulldogs, who were one win away from the “Final Four” last year, were up nine early in the second half before Muhlenberg (9-8) went on a 9-1 run to cut the
gap to one. DeSales (14-4) repsonded with a 9-0 run of its own to extend its lead to double digits and went 6-for-6 from the line in the last minute to put the game away.

Muhlenberg held DeSales, which came in shooting .471 from the field, to 38.9-percent shooting for the game, including 26.9 percent in the second half. Braswell finished
with a career-high 32 points.

Sophomore Spencer Liddic led the Mules with his seventh double-double (14 points, 12 rebounds). Nwizugbo (left) and senior Brian Frankoski
(right) netted eight points apiece, as did junior Evan Tozer and freshman Rob Berish.

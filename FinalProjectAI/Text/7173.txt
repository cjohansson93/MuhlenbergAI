Men's Soccer, Field Hockey Fall Late
 Wednesday, September 18, 2013







					 



The Muhlenberg men’s soccer and field hockey teams went on the road and took quality opponents down to the wire before coming up just short. 

Men’s soccer saw its four-game winning streak come to an end with a 2-1 loss in double overtime at Drew.




Katz recorded his second career assist on Dotzman’s first-half goal.




The Mules, ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region coming in, jumped on top of the Rangers (ranked 10th) in the seventh minute, when Lance Dotzman scored his third goal of the season on a beautiful feed from Oliver Katz. Katz played a ball into the middle of the box, where Dotzman was there to slot home for a quick strike that gave Katz his first assist of the season.

Muhlenberg (4-2) entered the contest with a four-game shutout streak, but that came to an end in the 50th minute, when Drew equalized with the first goal against the Mules in 450 minutes. The Rangers had scored at least three goals in five straight games before Muhlenberg managed to hold them down through regulation.

The teams were knotted at 1 after 90 minutes. After a scoreless first extra session, the Rangers quickly ended things when the ball deflected off a Muhlenberg defender and right to Drew’s Dylan Hammer, who found the back of the net for the Golden Goal less than two minutes into double overtime.

With his goal, Dotzman became the Mules’ active leader in that category, with four career tallies to his name.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team, meanwhile, suffered a similar setback. The Mules took a lead early in the second half, but were unable to hang on and dropped a 2-1 decision at Elizabethtown. The loss snapped a two-game winning streak.




Swire took the penalty corner that led to Thies' goal.




After a sluggish first half in which the teams combined for just four shots, junior Kayleigh Thies put the Mules ahead just three minutes into the second, scoring from the middle off a penalty corner taken by junior Samantha Swire. The goal was the fourth of the season for Thies, and the 20th of her career.

The Mules (2-3) made the advantage stand up until the 59th minute, when the Blue Jays equalized off a penalty corner of their own. Less than three minutes later, Elizabethtown took the lead for good, converting another penalty corner for the game-winner with just under nine minutes remaining. Muhlenberg managed one more penalty corner down the stretch, but was unable to find a late equalizer.

The Blue Jays held a 12-6 advantage in shots and penalty corners, and they used the latter to turn the tide. Elizabethtown scored both goals during a quick flurry in which it earned four penalty corners in a span of four minutes as the Blue Jays applied constant pressure on Muhlenberg goalie Sierra Lanker (three saves) and the Mules’ defense.

Senior Ashley DeAngelis had a defensive save for the Mules. It was DeAngelis’ third of the season and 16th of her career, pulling her into a tie for second place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list.

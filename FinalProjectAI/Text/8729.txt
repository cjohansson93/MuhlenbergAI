Our low-residency model combines the best of meaningful on-campus learning experiences with distance learning strategies.

Fall and Spring semester graduate courses will meet on-campus in weeks 1, 5 and 8. 
Summer 10-week session courses will meet on-campus in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10
Classes outside of those weeks would be conducted via remote-live meetings 
Other  course requirements completed through various digital strategies 

Accommodation requests for medical reasons will follow the Muhlenberg College policy (contact our admissions team to discuss).
The Dean of Graduate Studies can evaluate accommodations related to work/life circumstances.

About the Accounting Program The Muhlenberg accounting program provides a unique opportunity for students to benefit from a strong liberal arts education while obtaining knowledge and skills in accounting, finance, economics, and business. By proper selection of accounting major and elective courses, students will be prepared to continue on with graduate study or to pursue a variety of careers in public accounting, law, the corporate world, or not-for-profit organizations. Courses focus on broad accounting concepts and issues but also develop the communication, technical, and interpersonal skills necessary to succeed in the professional world today. Students are encouraged to enhance their leadership skills, to develop high ethical standards, and to achieve their full potential throughout this program. A variety of options to pursue study abroad, obtain internships, or spend a semester in Washington, DC also exist.

          Life-Long Relationships, on the Field and in the Classroom
  








Matthew BolandMajor(s): Accounting and Finance
Muhlenberg's liberal arts curriculum allows students to study different subjects and focus in on the skills they want to develop for their post-college careers. After my freshman year at Muhlenberg, I decided that accounting and finance was the best way to go. The ABEF department made it feasible for me to study both majors because of electives that cross both fields and classes that are offered at different times or days. My accounting and finance degrees helped me start my career in public accounting.
My Muhlenberg experience was much more than I originally expected coming out of high school. I was able to study two majors and work in the writing center, as well as play football and throw javelin for the track team. I also developed life-long relationships with teammates, coaches, friends, classmates, and professors. Practices, group study nights, and tutoring sessions were routine, so I was constantly receiving help from all angles with my schoolwork and athletics. Attending a small liberal arts college like Muhlenberg made all of that possible.
The accounting and finance professors at Muhlenberg are dedicated and take time to get to know their students. They prepared me for job interviews and introduced me to people who eventually offered internship and job opportunities during and after college. Big firms recruit at Muhlenberg, and the professors are willing and able to get their students ready for such opportunities. I am grateful for all the opportunities Muhlenberg provided me while I was there, and even after I graduated. Thanks to my Muhlenberg experience, I was able to enjoy college life and then get started on my career. I still try to make it back home to Allentown as often as I can and will forever have great memories of my time at Muhlenberg. GO MULES!
 






          My 'Berg Experience
  








Samantha Blair UngerMajor(s): Accounting and Mathematics(Dual-degree AB-BS program)
When I came to Muhlenberg, I was one of those students who had no idea what I wanted to study. I was good with numbers, good with people, and not sure where to go from there. Being in the Muhlenberg Scholars Honors Program really let me explore a host of subjects that I wouldn't have otherwise - including the Biology of Disease and the Psychology of Superstition. From my first semester, I started taking courses in Mathematics and soon declared it as my major, but still felt I was searching for more. I had done well in Economics in high school, so my mathematics advisor suggested that I take Financial Accounting in the spring of my freshman year. Well, three years and 40 credits later, the Accounting department became my home.
Life after 'Berg has been remarkable. During my senior year I received job offers for accounting positions at prestigious firms, but opted to attend graduate school at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in pursuit of my Master's Degree in Financial Mathematics. The program combines the two loves I found at Muhlenberg and my liberal arts background has really put me ahead of the game in terms of my writing and argument-making skills. In September I will be starting my career with Deloitte as a Consultant in the Enterprise Risk Services Division in New York City.
If you had asked me five years ago where I would be now, I would have never guessed that this would be my path, but I could not be happier. Muhlenberg not only gave me an education that allowed me to excel to my highest potential, but it also gave me friends and memories to last a life time, and for all of those reasons I am eternally grateful.
 






          "Broadening Perspective"
  








Alyssa SteinerMajor(s): Accounting and Business Administration (Marketing Concentration)
The liberal arts education I received at Muhlenberg allowed me to open my mind to subjects and classes totally outside of my majors. Because of this, I learned in many different environments and began to think about things in different ways. I found myself realizing that even though the subject matter of my liberal arts classes didn't directly correlate with my accounting and business classes, I was able to benefit by applying my broadening perspective to the classes within my majors.
The professors I've had within the ABEF department frequently built upon concepts I learned in other classes, both furthering my knowledge and allowing me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Even now as I prepare for the CPA Exam, I'm able to recognize information in the material that I learned in many of my classes across both of my majors. My experience at Muhlenberg has provided me with the tools that I need not only to begin my career in public accounting, but to feel confident in my abilities, as well.






          From the Dean's Office to Industry Headquarters
  








Michael ReitzMajor(s): Accounting and Business Administration
Michael Reitz '11 graduated cum laude in May, along with his cousin Joel Reitz '11, seventy-five years after their grandfather, The Rev. Phares O. Reitz '36. Mike earned a B.A. in Accounting and Business Administration (Entrepreneurial Studies). Very involved behind the scenes at Muhlenberg, Mike worked for Dean Karen Green and Jane Schubert in the Dean of Students office. "The best things about my four years at Muhlenberg were the academic challenges and the life experiences which have made me a better, more rounded individual. Muhlenberg provided me an extremely caring and nurturing learning environment."
Mike is now a Fixed Asset Accountant for Lutron Electronics Company, Inc., the industry leader in electronic lighting controls, headquartered in Coopersburg, PA. In addition, Mike continues to pursue his entrepreneurial interests in property management and hopes to have his first property within a year. "Muhlenberg's liberal arts programs, especially the Accounting, Business, and Economics department and its staff, helped me land a phenomenal job. I was often pushed outside my comfort zone which made me accomplish things I would have never thought were possible."Looking back it is hard to believe Mike embarked on his college journey four years ago. "Time flies, that's for sure. I remember feeling afraid to go to college and thinking graduation was a lifetime away. My advice to all students is to cherish your college years for they will be over before you know it, and to take advantage of all the wonderful programs and opportunities Muhlenberg has to offer." Mike plans to continue to be a part of his alma mater and he wishes current and future students all the best.

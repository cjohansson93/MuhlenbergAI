MINOR REQUIREMENTS
To complete the Womenâs & Gender Studies minor, students must complete WST 202: Topics in Women's & Gender Studies (or * an equivalent course designated by director) and five additional courses from the list of approved cross-listed courses. Students may choose their five additional WST courses according to their own interests. A WST internship and an independent study can also count toward the minor. With its great variety of courses, the WST minor allows students to fulfill many graduation requirements while completing the minor. There are classes that count towards the WST minor that also fulfill the divisional and perspectives requirements. WST 202: Topics in Womenâs and Gender Studies fulfills part of the Writing requirement. All other WST courses also count toward at least one major.
The five additional courses to be chosen in consultation with the Director include but are not limited to this list of courses:

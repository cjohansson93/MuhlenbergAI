Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College is pleased to host the solo show Growing up Green, by Greta Bergstresser.  The exhibition features an array of photographs organized into a series of visual essays that capture vignettes exploring traditional agricultural practices that she grew up with. The exhibition will be on view February 12 â May 20.  At this time, the Gallery is only permitting Muhlenberg faculty, staff and students to view the exhibition in person, however visitors are encouraged to visit the artistâs website to view this and other projects.
Greta Kathryn Bergstresser was born in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. She pursued an early interest in photography and was selected to attend the selective Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts. Greta graduated with a B.A. in Art from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 2004 and proceeded to get her M.F.A. in Photography from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. Greta currently resides in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania pursuing her own fine art photography as well as teaching photography at both Muhlenberg College and Lafayette College.

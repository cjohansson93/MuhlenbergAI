Post a Job or Internship
We post internships and full time jobs for students, recent graduates, as well as experienced alumni in our system, Handshake.  You can choose between two options below to post a position in our system:
Option #1
Post a job directly in our system at https://muhlenberg.joinhandshake.com.  You will have the option to sign in if you have used the Handshake system before.  If you haven't used Handshake, you can select "sign up for an account" in the left corner.
Option #2
Send your job posting directly to  careers@muhlenberg.edu and we will post it for you.  If you do this, please be sure to include the internship/job description, company information, and how you would like applicants to apply. Also, if you are a Muhlenberg alumni and/or parent, be sure to let us know!

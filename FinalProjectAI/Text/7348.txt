The Muhlenberg track teams came back from the Gwynedd Mercy Midweek Invitational with plenty of high finishes in tow.

Six first-place finishes, divided evenly between the men and women, highlighted 17 top-three performances for the Mules. 
Juniors Josh Elkan in the 1,500 meters, Zach Lifman (right) in the 5,000 and 
Kieran Newcomb in the steeplechase each captured his first career outdoor event. 

Freshman Claudia Theriault won the pole vault with a new PR, jumping into third on the program’s all-time performance list, and sophomore Ashley Riley prevailed in the long jump. Senior Nicki Cronin took first with an ECAC-qualifying time in the 5,000 meters.

Senior Amber Lee Wojtkowski set a new personal best with an ECAC time in the 100-meter hurdles, one of six second-place results for Muhlenberg. Riley (left) was second in the triple jump, as were freshman Jacqueline Jones in the high jump, senior Lauren Zakheim in the steeplechase, sophomore Claire Thornton in the 1,500 and senior Jarrett Felix in the 800.

Jones led a 2-3-4 finish for the Mule women in the high jump, with sophomores Katrina Faust and Sarah Weyhmuller coming in behind her.

Sophomore Brandon Tauber was third in the high jump and triple jump, while freshman Michelle Gaykowski finished third in the shot put, moving into seventh on the performance list with a personal best.

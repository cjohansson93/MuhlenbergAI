âBerg Names New Campus Restaurant



Muhlenberg College has named its new campus restaurant the "Ilene and Robert Wood Dining Commons."  


	 Monday, November 1, 2010  11:45 AM

The name honors long-time friends and benefactors, Bob and Ilene Wood of Allentown.
"Bob and Ilene are great friends of the College," said Muhlenberg College President Randy Helm.  "The College has been associated with the Wood family over a period spanning eight decades.  Any other name for this beautiful space is simply inconceivable." In announcing the naming of the new Wood Commons, Helm remarked that the decision to honor the Woods recognized not only the long relationship with the Wood family and the many contributions of its employees, but also Bob and Ilene Wood's exemplary volunteer service in the Lehigh Valley Community.  "Virtually everywhere you turn in Allentown and beyond," said Helm, "you find Bob and Ilene as an energetic presence promoting the arts and the overall well-being of Lehigh Valley residents.  They are an inspiring example not only to Muhlenberg's volunteer leadership, but to our students and alumni as well, of how to live a life of leadership and service."
Bob Wood is currently a trustee of the College.  Scotty Wood Stadium, built in 1999, is named after Bob's father Milton W. "Scotty" Wood.
 

Muhlenberg College and the Wood family have had a relationship since 1948, when the College awarded its first outside dining contract to local restaurant owner Scotty Wood.  From that first contract, Wood Dining Services grew into a corporation that serviced more than 400 institutions.  The College recently signed a long-term contract with Sodexo, which acquired the Wood Company several years ago.
The spectacular Bob and Ilene Wood Dining Commons is part of the $20 million expansion and renovation to Seegers Union, which was completed in August 2010.  The campus restaurant seats 610 people and features seven different dining platforms, including two independent kosher meat and dairy kitchens.
The new dining facility has already been featured in University Business magazine, Food Service Director magazine and Kosher Today magazine.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg College is a highly selective, private liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

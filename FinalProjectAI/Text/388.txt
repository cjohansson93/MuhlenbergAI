Thinking about auditioning for Theatre?



An audition or portfolio review is not required to study theatre at Muhlenberg â but it can be a great way for us to get to know you and for you to get to know the theatre program.
And while it's is not required, a strong audition or interview can improve your chances of admission, and an audition or portfolio review is required for students who wish to be considered for a talent scholarship. Students do not have to major in theatre to be considered for an award.
For the 2021-2022 academic year, we will be conducting theatre auditions and portfolio reviews virtually for all prospective students. We ask that you use the audition/interview form to tell us a little bit about yourself, and to send us an audition video (if you want to), and then we'll schedule a time for you to meet with a faculty member one-on-one via Zoom for a virtual interview. 
We strongly encourage you also to visit campus in person, whether or not you plan to audition or interview. During your visit, can tour the facilities, talk with students and faculty, and visit a theatre class. To schedule a campus visit, please fill out the campus visit form.
Have more than one area of interest? Please let us know! We would love to talk to you about all of your theatrical passions.
Timelines
Early Decision 1:    application deadline: Nov. 15   audition date: Dec. 1   admissions decision: mid-December
Early Decision 2:   application deadline: Feb. 1   audition date: Feb. 1   admissions decision: Feb. 15-28
Regular Decision:   application deadline: Feb. 1   audition date: Feb. 1   admissions decisions: mid-March
Audition dates above are ideal to give us the opportunity to review your audition, conduct an interview with you, and add feedback to your admissions profile. Financial aid packages will be available to view on the same day students receive notification of their acceptance (as long as students have set up their financial aid portal). For more information on admissions and timelines, visit the Admissions website.
For students interested in acting:
You can submit your video audition through the Audition & Interview Form. The form is the preferred method of sending us your audition video. However, if you have technical difficulties, you may find another way, such as uploading your video to YouTube, Vimeo, or Google Drive and including the URL in the audition form. Contact us at theatredance@muhlenberg.edu with any questions you may have.
After we receive your materials, we will contact you to set up a Zoom interview. As part of the interview process, we will be able to answer any questions you have about the program.
For the acting audition, two contrasting monologues totaling not more than four minutes in length are required. It is recommended that no accents be used, and characters chosen should be in the actor's age range. 
Students with an interest in musical theatre performance may also sing one song (32 bars) selected from the musical theatre repertoire in addition to the monologues. Students with classical voice training have the option to sing an additional 32-bar section of an art song or aria. A song is not required for the audition.
For students interested in directing
A zoom directing interview is available. Please fill out the Audition & Interview Form, and we'll schedule your interview. You may submit a resume and any (if you would like, although they're not required) any portfolio materials (prompt books, production photos, programs etc.) through the form. In addition, two letters should be submitted from teachers or theatre professionals attesting to the quality of the student's talent and work ethic. The letters should be submitted directly to theatredance@muhlenberg.edu.
Directing applicants also have the option to submit an acting audition in addition to their interview. See above for acting audition information.
For students interested in stage management or design and technology
A zoom interview is available. Please fill out the Audition & Interview Form, or contact Professor Rebecca Lustig at rebeccalustig@muhlenberg.edu to set up an interview appointment.
You're welcome to send portfolio materials when you fill out the Audition & Interview form, but it's not necessary. If you do wish to send materials, feel free to include drawings from art classes, photos of work presented on stage, light plots, costume renderings, photos of creative art projects, or other materials that show visual artistic ability and imagination.
In addition, two letters should be submitted from teachers or theatre professionals, attesting to the quality of the student's talent and work ethic. The letters can be submitted directly to Professor Lustig at rebeccalustig@muhlenberg.edu.
For students interested in playwriting
Applicants may submit a sample (between five and ten pages) of their dramatic writing via the Audition & Interview Form. We will contact the applicant to arrange an interview after we hear from you. 
In addition, two letters should be submitted from teachers or theatre professionals, attesting to the quality of the student's talent and work ethic. The letters can be submitted directly to theatredance@muhlenberg.edu. 
If you have any questions about the audition/interview process, please don't hesitate to contact us at theatredance@muhlenberg.edu for more information.

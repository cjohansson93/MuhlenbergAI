The Eastern Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Institute of Architects has recognized Spillman Farmer Architects with an “award of excellence” for their remodeling of the Life Sports Center at Muhlenberg College. The award demonstrates the firm’s growing reputation for the design of outstanding sports, fitness and recreation facilities.
This Award of Excellence, the only one given out this year, was presented after a juried competition that included residential, commercial and institutional projects. The jury, upon evaluating the Muhlenberg Life Sports Center, commented that it was “outstandingly knit into context of the campus” and “the most successful project on all levels of design and detailing – from massing to finish material joints.”
The latest in a strong history of sports architecture awards, Spillman Farmer Architects has also been recognized for the development of athletic facilities at Susquehanna University, Lehigh University and East Stroudsburg University.
The project’s Principal in Charge, Daniel L. Harrigan, AIA explains that the glass, limestone, and brick building “was designed to visually and functionally link with the stadium and track.” He added, “Students and staff have told me that it is great to see that the quality of the facilities finally match the quality of athletics and recreation programs at the College. It’s great to be part of making that happen.”
In designing options for renovating and adding space to the existing Life Sports Center, Spillman Farmer Architects created a new main entrance facing the interior of the campus. Other design and space planning aspects included the desire for building openness and transparency along with joining the buildings in a way that would provide a single complex.
An additional goal was to locate coaches’ offices in proximity to one another and to provide ready access to visiting prospective students. The Student Health Center and Counseling Services, formerly housed in a small structure that had to be razed to make way for a new building, were also included in the new building design. The centralized campus location of the new facility was a major factor in this decision.
Working in partnership with the College, the design team developed a renovation program and expansion plan that accommodates more and varied recreation and fitness activities while remaining visually appealing. The curved-glass façade of the addition echoes the curve of the existing track and superbly achieves the sense of openness, transparency, and connectivity envisioned during the planning process.
Among the facility improvements are a fitness room with cardio, free weight, and Pilates equipment, a health and counseling center, locker and training facilities for field sports (field hockey, softball, soccer, football), and new office space for the athletic department. Also included in the center is the Powerhouse Café, where students can grab a nutritious snack after a workout.
The Eastern Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Institute of Architects has over 170 members who work and live in the Stroudsburg, Lehigh Valley, and Reading areas. Membership includes Registered Architects, Intern Architects, Associate Design Professionals, and Allied members from firms and businesses related to the practice of architecture. In addition to the Design Awards program, the Chapter holds monthly meetings with a focus on professional development, improving community awareness of architectural services, and involvement in local design and planning initiatives.

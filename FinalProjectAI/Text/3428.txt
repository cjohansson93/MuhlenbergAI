Two named all-region in women’s lax 




Two midfielders, senior Ruth Morrongiello and junior Amanda McGovern, of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team were selected to the All-Metro Region second team. Both players also were second-team All-Centennial Conference picks.

Morrongiello (left) ranked eighth in Division III in draw controls per game (4.93), breaking her own school record with 69 draws won on the season. She was fourth on the team in scoring with 41 points. Morrongiello ended her career as the program’s all-time leader in draw controls (224), and she also ranked fifth in points (180), goals (141) and ground balls (131), sixth in hat tricks (25) and seventh in assists (39).

McGovern (right) led the Mules in scoring with 61 points – the fifth-highest single-season total in team history – on 46 goals and 15 assists. She had hat tricks in nine of the 14 games and also was second on the team in draw controls (38) and fourth in ground balls (30). McGovern will enter her senior season tied for eighth on the all-time lists in both goals (104) and assists (37).

This was the first time since 1997 that Muhlenberg had two women’s lacrosse players earn all-region honors.

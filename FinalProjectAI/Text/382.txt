NET PRICE CALCULATOR 
Welcome to Muhlenbergâs Net Price Calculator.  We are happy to work with you to estimate your cost to attend Muhlenberg, and to make the Muhlenberg experience affordable for you.
Just a few reminders before you begin:  The Net Price Calculator is a new requirement of the federal government.   Some of the format for reporting the estimated cost to you is also a product of federal regulation.  While it can provide a broad estimate of college costs, there are limitations.  For example, at Muhlenberg, we donât operate on a single financial aid âformula.â  We customize every financial aid package.  A computerized calculator, which must operate on a set of formulas, cannot possibly capture all of the nuances that drive the ways in which we customize financial aid packages.  As an example, we offer the opportunity for Talent Grants in the performing and visual arts based on audition or portfolio review.  A formula-driven Net Price Calculator canât capture that possibility.
So remember as you review the information that our Net Price Calculator will provide that this is an estimate, and a broad estimate based on our most recent yearâs financial aid policies and our most recent yearâs experience in financial aid packaging.  Changes in policy or packaging strategies that may be driven by changes in the economy or the neediness of our applicant pool can change the outcome.
The best way to find out about financial aid and net cost at Muhlenberg is to apply for admission and apply for financial aid.  Your application will provide complete information upon which to base our customized approach to aid packaging, and your application for financial aid will provide complete information (including the complexities of owning your own business, additional real estate holdings, business losses, etc.) on which to base a financial aid decision here.
Finally, if you are seriously contemplating an Early Decision application to Muhlenberg, know that we stand ready to do an Early Financial Read in order to provide additional information upon which to base your decision about Early Decision.  To explore this more detailed and personalized Early Read process in greater detail, contact our Office of Financial Aid at 484-664-3175 or netpricecalculator@muhlenberg.edu. 
Good luck as you pursue higher education and think about college costs.  We stand ready to work with you to make Muhlenberg a reality!
Sincerely, Greg MittonDirector of Financial AidAssociate Dean of Admissions

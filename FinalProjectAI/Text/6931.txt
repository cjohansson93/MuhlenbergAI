Sophomore Jaimie Klotz was one of seven Mules to drive in a run in the second game, hitting a two-run single in the fifth.



Playing in the city where the TV comedy “The Office” takes place, it was another night at the office for the Muhlenberg softball team.



The Mules swept Scranton, 8-4 and 10-7, in their final regular-season doubleheader to become the first College team in any sport to
reach the 30-win mark. Muhlenberg, which broke the school records for wins by the softball team and wins by any team in its last doubleheader,
will take its 30-7-1 record and 10-game winning streak into this weekend’s Centennial Conference playoffs, which it will host.

The twinbill also featured some personal milestones and records. 

Sophomore Kelsey Jones tied the school record of 16 wins in a season by tossing a complete game in the opener. She also tied
a career high with 12 strikeouts. Jones (16-2), who was pitching a four-hit shutout going before giving up a home run in the sixth, struck out
at least one batter in every inning and had five innings with two strikeouts.

Senior Devon Barber crossed home plate once in each game to tie the school record of 114 runs scored. 
Her first run scored came as part of a five-run second inning that included two-run singles by freshman Alexis Giovinazzo
and junior Erica Wenzel.

Wenzel and junior Kelly Kline both went 3-for-4 with two RBI in the game.

The second game started off with a bang, as leadoff hitter Alyssa Schell hit her first career home run. The Mules went on to
score in each of the first five innings to open up a 10-2 lead. 

The Lady Royals (13-18) made things interesting by scoring three in the
fifth and two in the sixth, but freshman Laura Hess retired the final six hitters to earn her first career win.

Kline drove in two more runs in the nightcap to move into a tie for third place on the CC all-time list with 117 in her career.

The National Surveys on Energy & Environment (NSEE) is a biannual national opinion survey on energy and climate policy and beliefs. Launched in 2008, the NSEE has covered topics such as public policy approaches to address climate change including federal, state, and international action; energy policies such as cap-and-trade, carbon taxes, renewable energy requirements, vehicle emissions standards, and many more; and knowledge and attitudes about global warming, climate adaptation, fracking and geoengineering.
Initially a partnership between Muhlenberg College and the University of Michigan, the NSEE has been produced exclusively by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion since 2020. The surveys are funded exclusively by Muhlenberg College.

baseball battles back in loss





Scenes like this are becoming common for Conti and the Mules.


On a cold, damp day at Cedarcreek Field, the Muhlenberg baseball team fought back from an early 8-0 deficit but came up short in an 11-9 loss to Haverford.

The Fords (11-5-1, 1-1) scored seven runs in their first two turns at bat and added another marker in the top of the fourth. The Mules (10-9, 1-1) scored twice
in the bottom of the fourth and twice more the next inning when junior Christian Conti launched his fifth home run of the season.

Muhlenberg trailed 11-5 before scoring four runs in the bottom of the eighth to make the game interesting. An RBI single by junior Eric Hammond, a bases-loaded
walk to Conti and a two-run single by junior Edward Risener brought the Mules within two. A sharp lineout to right ended the inning with the tying runs on base.

The tying runs reached base again in the bottom of the ninth, but the Haverford shortstop made a tough catch of a popup in shallow left field to end the game.

Conti finished 3-for-3, and his three RBI gave him 31 for the season, which already is tied for ninth on Muhlenberg’s all-time single-season list with a month
left in the campaign. Risener is close behind with 30 RBI.

Women's Soccer Falls to Hopkins in CC Semis
 Friday, November 8, 2013







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team ran into a Johns Hopkins buzzsaw in the semifinals of the Centennial Conference playoffs and lost, 8-0.

The Blue Jays (17-1-1), who have been ranked in the top 10 in Division III all season, including some time at No. 1, bombarded the Mules
with 19 shots in the first half and opened up a 6-0 lead at the break.

The Mules (7-11-2) took seven of their eight shots in the second half but could not put one in. The eight goals were the most allowed by Muhlenberg
since 1994.

Under constant pressure all evening, senior Amanda Wong and sophomore Jen Mermelstein combined to make 12 saves.

The game ended the careers of seniors Susan Galgano, Stephanie Tramutola, Wong and CJ Graetzer
(left to right in picture), who led the team to back-to-back playoff appearances in their final two seasons after the Mules missed the
playoffs their first two years.

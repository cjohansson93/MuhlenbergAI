Awards and Grants
The Dean's office supports Scholarships, Fellowships and Awards as well as Summer Research Stipends in all disciplines. Since its inception, the former has resulted in more than 150 awards, finalist statuses and honorable mentions for students and recent graduates, including Truman scholarships, Fulbright scholarships and National Science Foundation scholarships. With these grants, students have pursued studies at Princeton, Harvard, Brown, Vanderbilt, the University of Wisconsin and universities overseas.
Closely mentored students, whether actual award winners or not, have praised our program for its value in developing their habits of self-scrutiny, their sense of participating in a professional conversation within and beyond the College and their competitiveness for graduate and professional school applications. Many of these students have received Summer Research Stipends of $3,000 in addition to academic credit and paid housing.

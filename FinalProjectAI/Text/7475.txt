Tennis Teams Lose CC Openers


Both Muhlenberg tennis teams fell to Franklin and Marshall in their Centennial Conference openers. The women dropped a 6-3 decision, while the men were swept, 9-0.

Freshmen Sara Finger and Jamie Rosenblum picked up straight-set victories at No. 1 and No. 6 singles, respectively, with both winning the second set at love. 

Senior Nina Sanders, meanwhile, pulled out a third-set tiebreaker at No. 2 for her first singles victory of the season.

Two weeks after returning from Spring Break, the Muhlenberg baseball team finally got to play its first home games of the season, but The College of New Jersey spoiled the day with a doubleheader sweep.

In “one of those games,” the Lions (9-4) took the opener 23-0. The Mules (6-7) rallied twice in the nightcap but fell short, falling 9-7.

Muhlenberg trailed 5-2 heading into the bottom of the sixth in Game 2 but raised its hopes thanks to the bat of freshman Robbie Hopes. After one run scored on a single by senior Nick Kennedy, Hopes tied the game by lining a pitch over the fence in left for a home run in just his fifth career plate appearance.

The game remained tied until TCNJ plated four runs in the top of the ninth, but the Mule bench made it interesting in the bottom of the ninth. The production of pinch-hitters Andrew Rava (walk), Nick Plinio (double) and Max Litvak (RBI single) led to two runs. The rally looked over, however, when a runner was picked off first with the tying run at the plate.

Muhlenberg wasn’t quite done yet, though. Back-to-back singles by junior Jimmy Cody and senior John Scuderi put the tying runs on base, but the game ended on a called third strike.

Scuderi (left) had a tremendous day, going 6-for-7 with a double, triple and RBI single. He went 5-for-5 in the nightcap to become the third different Mule to record at least five hits in a game in the last two seasons.

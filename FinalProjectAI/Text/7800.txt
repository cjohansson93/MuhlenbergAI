Field Hockey Beats Haverford to Avenge Playoff Loss

The Muhlenberg field hockey team finished what it was unable to do in back-to-back games last season, including one in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs: overcome a 1-0 deficit and beat Haverford.

“It hurt losing to them in playoffs last year,” said senior Kayleigh Thies, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win. “But winning this game is a total boost to our confidence.”

The Mules (6-2, 2-1) trailed early, giving up a goal just 3:02 into the game. They responded well with added pressure after the score, and in the 20th minute were able to equalize with Thies’ seventh goal of the year. Sophomore Rachel Strow, who assisted on the first goal, connected with Thies again just 2:39 later to quickly put the Mules in front for good.

“We don’t let goals get us down,” said Strow (right). “It is something we have really improved on.”

The Fords (4-5, 0-2) are now added to the list with Johns Hopkins of teams Muhlenberg has beaten this season for the first time since 2009. In order for the Mules to reach their goal of a conference championship, they know these teams will be in their path.

“We were able to make it to the playoffs last season without beating those two teams,” continued Thies. “But now beating both makes us feel like we can compete with anyone.” 

Muhlenberg scored both goals off of corners, making it seven goals off the penalty play in the last six games. For Thies, it has been the Mules’ great defense that has led to the productive offense.

“Our defense plays strong on corners,” said Thies, “and we get to play them every day in practice and it helps in games.”

That defense also helped close the door shut on Haverford once the Mules took the lead. Senior Sierra Lenker notched four saves after the early goal and classmate Heather Porrini pitched in with a defensive save seconds into the second half.

With her four points, Thies now stands alone in third place all-time in program history with 89.

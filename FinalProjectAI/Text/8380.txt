Emily Ledesma â20, a mathematics major, is part of the Institute for Citizens and Scholarsâ 2021 class of Pennsylvania Woodrow Wilson (WW) Teaching Fellows. According to the Instituteâs press release, the program ârecruits both recent graduates and career changers with strong backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and mathâthe STEM fieldsâand prepares them specifically to teach in high-need secondary schools in Pennsylvania. Each WW Pennsylvania Teaching Fellow receives $32,000 to complete a specially designed, cutting-edge masterâs degree program based on a yearlong classroom experience. In return, Fellows commit to teach for three years in high-need Pennsylvania schools.â
Ledesma, a native of Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, is student-teaching at the George Washington Carver High School of Engineering and Science in Philadelphia. 
âI am so spoiled at Carver,â Ledesma says. âThe kids are so much fun.â 
Ledesma graduated from Muhlenberg College in 2020 with a degree in mathematics. She was planning on completing her student teaching through the School of Continuing Studies, but her plans kept getting pushed back due to the pandemic. It wasnât until she heard about the WW Scholars opportunity through a former professor that she decided to rethink her plans. 
âI never expected to go back and get my masterâs degree,â she says. âThis program is great, because I can get through my student teaching, get my certification and get a masterâs degree.â 
Forty individuals belong to the programâs third cohort. They attend Duquesne University, West Chester University and The University of Pennsylvania.

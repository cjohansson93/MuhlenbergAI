Muhlenberg dancers enjoy the best of both worlds: the artistic discipline and training of an intense studio program, and the intellectual rigor and scholarly breadth of a first-class liberal arts college.
All Muhlenberg students can take Dance courses. We offer beginning through advanced technique courses every semester in an expansive array of dance techniques including African, Ballet, Jazz, Modern/Contemporary, Tap, Hip Hop, Aerial Acrobatics, Partnering and Pointe, and Variations.
Dance Majors and Minors deepen their learning with wide-ranging course work in dance history, composition, dance science, performance, and dance education.
The program offers extensive opportunities for students to perform, choreograph, stage-manage, and teach within our co-curriculum. In addition to a nationally acclaimed and ambitious Mainstage production season, the Department supports a wide variety of student-initiated studio projects each year, offering wide-ranging opportunities for students to explore all of their interests and talents.
The college offers an extensive course catalog in a wide variety of Arts & Science disciplines, as well as a number of very strong pre-professional programs including pre-med and pre-law. Students in Theatre & Dance take numerous courses in the Arts & Sciences, and are encouraged to pursue all of their academic interests during their years at Muhlenberg.
Take a look at the College Course Catalog. Courses and requirements for the Dance major and minor can be found here.

Mission Statementâ
The Office of Disability Services at Muhlenberg College is committed to ensuring nondiscrimination and access to all programs, activities, and services for qualified students with disabilities. Students with documented conditions or disorders that rise to the level of a disability have access and opportunities to engage in the full range of experiences available to all students at Muhlenberg College including curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities. The Office of Disability Services is committed to working with students, staff, and faculty in developing and implementing the most appropriate strategies for a successful learning experience while maintaining the academic standards and integrity of the mission of the College.
Being a student-focused Department, the Office of Disability Services strives to reinforce to students a vision of post-secondary success, through the pursuit of academic achievement and the development of self-advocacy skills. Understanding that an informed college community is better able to address the multiple issues related to disabilities, the Office of Disability Services strives to keep all constituencies abreast of the most up-to-date information regarding related laws and regulations and the means to achieve compliance and beyond.

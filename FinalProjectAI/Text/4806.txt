women’s tennis breaks winless drought



Women’s Lacrosse Falls on Senior Day


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team could not get anything going on offense and lost to Ursinus, 12-3, in its final home game of 2010.

The Mules (8-6, 3-5), who came in averaging almost 14 goals per game, needed a win, another win Saturday at Washington and some help to qualify
for the Centennial Conference playoffs for the third straight year.

Muhlenberg’s four seniors – Alyssa Bascelli, Ashley Foltiny, Amanda McGovern and Danielle Scarrone –
were honored before the game. McGovern became the second player in program history to record 200 points with a goal and an assist in the game.
Her assist was on the first career goal for freshman Alexandra Gabriele.

A change in scenery led to a change in results for the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team, which snapped a seven-match losing streak with a 7-2
home win against Bryn Mawr.

The match was played indoors due to heavy rains in the afternoon. It was the first time this spring that a home tennis match was moved into the
Deitrich Fieldhouse.

The Mules, whose eight losses this spring are to teams with a combined record of 91-38 (.705), won two out of three doubles matches, then clinched
the match by posting victories at the top three singles spots. Junior Caitie Druker prevailed 7-6, 6-4 in a close, back-and-forth match at
No. 1, junior Sara Sutker pulled out the second set for a 6-0, 7-5 win, and junior Danielle Winston (left) had the most decisive win of
the match, 6-0, 6-1.

Juniors Lindsay Schmidt and Deniz Uzel added victories at fourth and sixth singles, respectively.

The Mules (4-8, 3-5) can finish at .500 in the Centennial Conference by winning their final two league matches, including the home finale against
Franklin & Marshall on Thursday.

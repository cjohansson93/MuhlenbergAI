About "2020 Vision: Contested Political Futures"
What is at stake in the 2020 Elections? More than a simple choice between candidates, the 2020 elections point to different possible political futures. What do these competing political futures reveal about American democracy, about the American presidency, Congress and the Courts? How will our choices at the ballot box reflect the prioritization of issues, such as those related to racism and discrimination, immigration, free speech and religion, international relations and global cooperation and the very electoral mechanisms on which American democracy depends? How will the outcomes of the 2020 election shape the future of economic development, social policy, health care, criminal justice reform, race relations and national and international security?
Cosponsorship and support for the 2020 series have been provided by the Forum Fund, awarded by the Faculty Committee on Lectures & Forums; the Office of the Provost; Pi Sigma Alpha (the political science honor society); and the Department of Political Science. The Department is grateful for opportunities to collaborate with the Center for Ethics and its 2020-2021 Speech & Action program, #bergvotes and the College Republicans and College Democrats student organizations.
For questions about the program, please contact Lanethea Mathews-Schultz, Chair and Professor of Political Science at mathews@muhlenberg.edu  or 484-695-1390.

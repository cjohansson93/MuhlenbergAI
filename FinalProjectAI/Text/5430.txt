field hockey keeps playoff hopes alive


Now this is change we can all believe in.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team continued to campaign hard for the Centennial Conference playoffs, defeating Franklin & Marshall at home, 2-0, for its fourth straight win.

With one week remaining in the regular season, the Mules (8-8, 4-4) still face an uphill climb. They are currently tied for

seventh with a 4-4 record and have to face two nationally ranked teams – No. 3 Ursinus, the incumbent CC champion, and No. 16 Gettysburg – both on the road.

“We’re the underdogs,” said sophomore Jess Kasza. “We’re going to celebrate this for a couple of hours and then get ready for next week.”

That Muhlenberg is a different team than the one that started out 1-5 is beyond debate.

“We’re bringing it all together now, making the small passes,” said Kasza. “We’re playing as a team. We keep talking all the time and work the ball up the field.”

The Mules spread the wealth against the Diplomats (5-11, 2-7), make connections on passes all over the field. They played like mavericks in the first half especially, liberally taxing the F&M defense with 17 shots and 12 penalty corners, but could not score.

With 15:19 left in the second half, sophomore Chessie Martinez finally inaugurated the scoring, proving that her lack of experience in the goals column was not a factor. She endorsed a cross from junior Nicki Notarianni for her first goal of the season, giving Muhlenberg a 1-0 lead on its 20th shot.

“You can take so many shots, and eventually they have to go in,” remarked Kasza. “That’s how we felt.”

Kasza put one in herself for an insurance goal with 3:03 left, much to the delight of all the hockey moms, dads, relatives and friends who came to honor the four Muhlenberg seniors at their final home game.

One of the four, Cara Rothacker, assisted on Kasza’s goal. Michelle Consiglio made three saves for her fourth shutout of the season, with Julie deLaurentis and Kristin Garbutt providing strong defense.

The team wanted to win the game for the seniors “really badly,” according to Kasza. “They’re the core of the team. We need to keep winning for them. This is their season.”

The Muhlenberg field hockey seniors approve that message.

Men's Soccer Wins Crowd-Pleasing CC Opener
 Saturday, September 15, 2012 - page 4







					 





Sophomore Lance Dotzman took two shots, helping the Mules to an 18-5 advantage.




The score was low, but the excitement sure was high as the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team defeated McDaniel 1-0 on the road. The crowd was “ooh-ing” and “ahh-ing” for the 
full 90 minutes.

After nearly 65 minutes of scoreless soccer, senior Cody Antonini dribbled to the center of the field and ripped a low shot into the left corner of the net for the lone goal of the game. It was his team-leading
fifth goal of the season, 

Throughout the game, Muhlenberg fired off shot after shot at the McDaniel goalie. The Mules (4-1, 1-0) had an 18-5 shot advantage over the Green Terror, and seven of Muhlenberg’s shots were on goal.

At the end of the first half, a shot by senior Kyle Plifka sent the McDaniel goalie flying before it rebounded off the crossbar. Antonini’s shot on an empty goal went high and out of play.

“We were frustrated at halftime. We needed to stay focused, keep putting pressure on them and keep taking it to them in the second half,” said Anotnini.

Less than three minutes into the second half, the McDaniel goalie almost knocked a corner kick by Chris Royer into the Green Terror goal, drawing another gasp from the crowd.



Women on Other Side of 1-0 Final

  
Despite a 14-6 advantage in shots, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team dropped its CC opener at McDaniel, 1-0. The Green Terror scored the lone goal early in the second half on a rebound after a free kick
hit the crossbar.

The game was hard fought and physical, with three yellow cards being handed out, two to McDaniel and one to Muhlenberg. The Green Terror’s card in the first half  led to three successive corner kicks by the Mules.

As in the game against Moravian, the Mules’ patience with the ball helped create a large number of offensive opportunities.

“We combined well in the midfield today. There were times when we were playing one touch around the field. Sometimes we forced our over-the-top balls too much and we need to 
remember to play the smart pass,” said Antonini.

One over-the-top ball, however, nearly led to a one-on-one opportunity for Antonini against the Green Terror goalie. He was two-thirds of the way down the field before being fouled from behind, ending the breakaway but
producing yet another gasp from the crowd.

“It’s tough on the road. They’re always tight games and we just have to win,” said Antonini.

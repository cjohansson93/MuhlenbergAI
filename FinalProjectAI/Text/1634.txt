	 Friday, September 16, 2005  01:59 PM

Performances are Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m; tickets may be reserved and purchased by phone at 484-664-3333 or purchased on the web at www.muhlenberg.edu/tickets.
Horovitz’s bold play is based on the explosive idea that Jews around the world might now be guaranteed citizenship and jobs in Germany – be granted their own living space. “As Chancellor of this great German republic, I extend an invitation to six million Jews from anywhere in the world to come to live their lives in Germany.” Announced to the world with apparent sincerity, the Chancellor’s outrageous political gesture launches a storm of confusion, protest, outrage, violence and hope.
“I speak to you, now: You will be given citizenship and full privileges in this great nation. You will be German. It is my heartfelt desire to re-establish a Jewish community in Germany, and to reduce, as much as humanly possible, the immeasurable shame we Germans feel each day of our lives for what this country did to our German-Jewish neighbors, 60 years ago. What I am saying to you six million Jewish people is quite simple, really. Please, come home. Please." --Rudolph Stroiber, Chancellor of the German Republic (from Lebensraum).
The Chancellor’s unthinkable yet visionary invitation generates dramatically disparate reactions that reverberate through the generations of German citizens at home and through the survivors, emigrants and descendents in America, Israel, Australia and around the world. This stunning exploration of history and forgiveness takes its audience on a thought-provoking journey in which actors switch quickly from one character to the next in near vaudevillian style. A cast of three actors plays over 40 characters in a rush of frenetic scenes that erupt out of the chaos of social, political and personal confusion. Horovitz chooses theatricality, invention and minimalism to tell a sharply-etched story, flooding audiences with sudden joy, dark humor and surprising humanity.
Actors are challenged to assume characters of differing ethnicities, accents, ages, exposing the charitable and the shameful things that all people do. An out-of-work Jewish dockworker from Gloucester, Massachusetts, chooses to bring his gentile wife and son to Germany in hope of prosperity; a survivor of Auschwitz returns to seek revenge on the woman who betrayed his family; a German minister preaches tolerance and understanding, while a German businessman capitalizes on the celebrity of his new Jewish workers. At the center of the play, an American boy and a German girl fall innocently and hopelessly in love, while their fathers struggle with the desperate shortage of jobs.
Against the backdrop of growing national tension, teenagers, parents and grandparents are forced to remember, listen and learn. From the youngsters who emerged in a culture that had erased its Jewish citizens, to parents who never dared to tell the truth about what they had witnessed, to grandparents who lingered in sadness and denial – how is Germany to prepare for this transformation? How do we handle the conflict between the need for forgiveness and the desire for revenge? How do we come to terms with history and, at the same time, put history behind us? Are reunion and integration possible? What happens when the Holocaust is no longer a distant echo of shame? Is redemption possible?
Funny yet devastating, this artfully drawn script from acclaimed playwright Israel Horovitz dares to risk exploring the path to atonement and asking the price of forgiveness. “All past is prologue,” writes Horovitz in his introduction to the play. “Such is the nature and condition of Hope. And, in the end, one cannot possibly have the fullest life without dreaming it, first. But, if we allow ourselves the dream, yes, oh, yes, all things are possible.”
Ironically, “Lebensraum” was Hitler’s promise to the German nation when he set out to conquer the world – such “living space” was believed to strengthen German unity, military power, and economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi Regime turned it into the rallying cry for expanding its European borders and overtaking Russia to ensure Germany’s greatness.
Director Noah Herman ’06 believes that at the play's very core is forgiveness and healing. The collective journey of Lebensraum is an exploration into what can be forgiven, what cannot, and what it takes to forgive. Herman calls the play “decidedly theatrical and decidedly comedic.” He explains that Horovitz has constructed this inherently comedic style of role-switching, in which an actor can have conversations with himself merely by changing hats, so that the play’s “devastating conclusion” is all the more poignant. “When the journey [of the play] is so much fun, the destination can take the audience anywhere,” Herman continues.
 Lebensraum is about the consequences and the power of decisions; it is about the past and the future, the young and the old. Doors are everywhere in this production as Herman asks the audience to consider the effects of each choice we make. The love story between two of the play’s younger characters, Anna and Sam, is also about the undaunted quality of hope that resounds eternally in the hearts of the young. Their fated romance represents “the hope that the older characters in the play do not have,” explains Herman.
 Lebensraum never lets the audience forget that this is a play, states Herman. The stage for this play will always be a stage as the actors often turn on and off their own lights and retrieve props from onstage prop tables. The transitions are quick and the set is minimalist; Herman says that an audience member can expect to see what “may look like the backstage of a theatre.” To carry this further, the production’s actual stage manager, Erica Hunt ’08, will come onstage to interact with the actors and the sound designer, Alex Garlen ’06, will be manipulating the show’s sound effects live onstage. Herman emphasizes that Horovitz does not intend for this to be “another Holocaust play.” Lebensraum has a new focus that enters more into the theoretical and the imaginative than the strictly historical. As Horovitz says in his introduction, “I felt that any play dramatizing Jews, Germans, the Holocaust, at this point in history, needed a fresh approach, both formally and substantially.”
Peter Pettit, Director of the Institute for Jewish-Christian Understanding at Muhlenberg College, will lead a conversation with the audience after the opening night performance on October 6. "The questions raised by the Shoa (Holocaust) are timeless, particularly when we look at how it came to be,” says Pettit. “MTA and Noah Herman courageously tackle some of those questions with Israel Horovitz' play, which considers whether justice can be simple and how ‘never again’ demands both societal and personal transformation.  This show will get you thinking, and then stay with you to think some more."

Becca Diamond '15

I graduated from Muhlenberg College in 2015 as a History major and Jewish Studies minor. Currently, I am a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, on track for ordination in 2022. Along with my studies, I work as the student rabbi at a congregation once a month, and I provide pastoral care to residents of an assisted living facility.
Studying history at Muhlenberg College has helped me in every stage of my professional journey. The amazing faculty of the history department supported me and guided me throughout my time at Muhlenberg, and their mentorship has helped me succeed beyond the classroom. The senior thesis and other research projects helped me develop writing and research skills that I use in every project I undertake, from sermon writing to fellowship applications. From my studies at Muhlenberg, I gained a deeper appreciation of the discipline of history and learned its application outside of academia; in the complex world we live in, understanding history has allowed me to view the world with greater awareness. I still refer back to the content I learned in my Muhlenberg classes, like African American Experience and Modern Middle Eastern History, to inform my perspectives on current events.

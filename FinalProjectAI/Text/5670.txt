women’s basketball howls past owls





Freshman Kelly McKeon appears to have wings coming out of her head as she zips a pass to Boyle for a jump shot that beat the first-half buzzer. McKeon totaled six points and six rebounds.


The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team hasn’t been beaten in two weeks, and the Mules aren’t about to beat themselves.

Muhlenberg committed only six turnovers and four personal fouls in winning its fourth straight game, 63-38 at Bryn Mawr. The Mules (16-5, 11-3) remained a game behind first-place Dickinson, a 51-48 winner at Gettysburg, in the Centennial Conference.

Although they have an unblemished (28-0) all-time record against the Owls and took care of the ball with such precision, the Mules were hardly perfect in this game. They were kept off the scoreboard for more than five minutes after the opening tip, falling behind 4-0.

A three-pointer by junior Lauren Boyle with 14:39 on the clock finally got the Muhlenberg offense untracked, kicking off a 14-0 run. The Mules led comfortably the rest of the game, extending their edge to as many as 28 in the second half.

Freshman Sheila Cook had an outstanding game, scoring a career-high 18 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Boyle finished with 13 points and a team-high eight rebounds. Sophomore Kaitlyn O’Malley contributed seven points, two assists and three steals.

Senior Abra Like dished out a game-high four assists to move into 10th place on the program’s all-time list with 187 for her career.

The Muhlenberg defense held Bryn Mawr (4-17, 1-13) to 28-percent shooting and forced 24 turnovers.

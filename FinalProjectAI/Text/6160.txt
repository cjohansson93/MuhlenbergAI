Eight Mules Named to All-Centennial Football Team
 Tuesday, November 15, 2011 - page 3







					 


Eight Muhlenberg football players accounted for nine spots on the 2011 All-Centennial Conference team.

Seniors Chris Hartzell (cornerback), Michael Porembski (center) and Patrick McDonough (linebacker) repeated on the first team. The Mules have a league 122 all-time first-team All-CC selections.

Senior Kenneth Cobb was a second-team defensive end, while senior Chase Nadell made the second team both as a cornerback and a kick returner. Seniors Mark Mounayar (nose tackle) and Scott Barton (offensive guard) and junior Terrence Dandridge (running back) earned honorable mention.

FIRST TEAM


Hartzell (left) leads the CC in interceptions per game and passes defended per game. He picked off four passes, one of which he returned 34 yards for a touchdown against Moravian, and led Muhlenberg with five pass breakups. He also recorded 27 tackles (22 solo), forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. Hartzell finished his career with 10 interceptions and tied for sixth on the Mules’ all-time list with 20 pass breakups.

Porembski (center) anchored an offensive line that hit its stride in the second half of the season. Over the last four games, all wins, the Mules averaged 218.5 rushing yards per game and 5.2 yards per carry. Porembski started eight games in 2011 and finished his career by starting the last 22 games in which he played.

McDonough (right) became the eighth Muhlenberg player to earn first-team All-CC honors in three seasons. Only 38 players in league history have accomplished that feat. McDonough leads the CC with 104 tackles, including nine tackles for loss and 5½ sacks.  The first Mule in 16 years to reach triple digits in tackles in back-to-back seasons, he finished his career with 333 tackles (third on the all-time list), including 189 solo (second).

SECOND TEAM


Cobb (left) earned All-CC recognition for the second consecutive season. In the CC, he is seventh with 6½ sacks and tied for second with three forced fumbles. He finished fourth on the Mules with 38 total tackles, broke up four passes and recovered two fumbles. Cobb ended his career fourth on the all-time list with 17½ sacks.

Nadell doubled up on the second team for the second year in a row, giving him five career All-CC nods (he was honorable mention as a defensive back in 2009). As a cornerback (center), he broke up four passes and was second on the Mules with 27 solo tackles. He also picked off a pass, recovered a fumble and forced a fumble. As a returner (right), Nadell averaged 23.2 yards per kickoff return, finishing his career second all-time at Muhlenberg in both kickoff return average (26.5) and yards (1220).

HONORABLE MENTION


Mounayar (left) earned honorable mention in just his second year as a defensive lineman after two years on the offensive line. The middleman in the Mules’ 3-4 was second on the team with 48 tackles.

Barton (center) was honored in his first season as a starter. The big left guard started all 10 games, filling in at center for two.

Dandridge (right) rushed for 741 yards and eight touchdowns. The sixth-leading rusher in the CC, he moved into fourth on the Muhlenberg all-time list with 2,314 yards

Glory
April 5-8, 2018
Adapted & Directed by Holly Cate from William Shakespeare's Henry VI tetralogyFaculty Spotlight Performance by Troy Dwyer
Teeming with larger-than-life characters, gripping action scenes, and plenty of violence, Glory chronicles the conflict between two competing royal houses that eventually erupts into the War of the Roses, one of the bloodiest periods in English history. This is Shakespeare at his most visceral and his most political, and Cateâs fierce, provocative adaptation harkens back to an era of crowns and crossed swords while still feeling startling contemporary â a world in which rule of law has collapsed and violence is the currency of state.
GLORY features violence, sexual content, and some nudity, and is recommended for mature audiences. 
Thursday, April 5, 8 p.m.Friday, April 6, 8 p.m.Saturday, April 7, 8 p.m.Sunday, April 8, 2 p.m.

Special Event:An Evening with Ellen McLaughlinFeminist Vision & Classic Greek Literature
Free Lecture & PerformanceSunday, April 8, 20188 p.m., in the Recital Hall, Baker Center for the Arts
âEllen McLaughlin â playwright, actor, and director â will discuss and perform segments from her adaptations of six Greek tragedies, commissioned by leading American theatre companies in response to political crises throughout the world. In particular, McLaughlin talks about her perspective on the Greeks as a female writer and scholar. McLaughlin is most well known for having originated the part of the Angel in Tony Kushnerâs Angels in America, appearing in every U.S. production from its earliest workshops through its Broadway run. She is also an award-winning writer and playwright, whose plays have received numerous national and international productions, including Days and Nights Within, A Narrow Bed, Infinityâs House, Iphigenia and Other Daughters, Tongue of a Bird, The Trojan Women, Helen, The Persians and Oedipus, and most recently, the critically acclaimed Septimus and Clarissa. As an actor, she has worked on and Off Broadway as well as extensively in regional theater.

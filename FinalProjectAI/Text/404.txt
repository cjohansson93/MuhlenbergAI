 William Zorach     (American, 1887-1966) Caprice, 1960 Bronze
 William Zorach is categorized among the group of American sculptors known as the direct carvers. They were popular in the early years of the twentieth century and worked predominantly in carved wood. Zorach along with Jo Davidson, John Flannagan, and Chaim Gross, produced many figural pieces in wood and metal. He looked to African sculpture for inspiration and aesthetic direction. His sculptures were beautifully handled and in most cases, as with Zorach’s piece at Muhlenberg, the female nude was the considered subject. Although Caprice is not as typical of Zorach’s career production as one of his early wooden pieces, this small bronze shows the artists ability to model forms.

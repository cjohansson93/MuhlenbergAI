Women’s Cross country beats the odds




Soccer, Volleyball Drop CC Openers


Men’s Soccer


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team dropped its Centennial Conference opener at Franklin & Marshall, 1-0.

The Diplomats (6-0), ranked 18th in Division III, scored their goal late in the first half. It was the first goal allowed by the Mules this season.

The F&M goalie made a huge save with 11:07 left to preserve the lead, and a header in the last two minutes went just wide.

Volleyball


The Muhlenberg volleyball team was swept at home by McDaniel in its first Centennial Conference match of the season.
Senior Megan Young acheived a milestone in the loss. Her 23 digs gave her 1,021 for her career, making her the ninth player in team history to reach quadruple figures.

Men’s Tennis


All three Muhlenberg men’s tennis players entered in the Centennial Conference Invitational went 0-2 in singles competition. The two doubles teams that won
their consolation matches on Friday are scheduled to play each other at Muhlenberg next week.

Somehow it was “odd” that the Muhlenberg women’s cross country team winning the Mule/Falcon Classic, and somehow it wasn’t.

Running with a split squad, and without their top four finishers from last week, the Mules finished a point ahead of Georgian Court to win the meet they co-host with
Cedar Crest for the seventh time. The Muhlenberg women have won the meet every odd-numbered year this decade: 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007.

The men, also lining up a split squad, came in second, 19 points back of Cabrini. The results showed the extraordinary depth of both Mule squads, who had only one runner
compete in both last week’s Lehigh Valley Championships and the Mule/Falcon Classic, yet ran excellent meets both times.

Freshman Kim Bier led three Muhlenberg women in the top 14, coming in sixth. Right behind her was junior Janette Adams, followed by sophomore Lauren Conicella, who held
off a Georgian Court runner heading to the finish line for what proved to be the difference. Freshman Hannah Mitchell was 11th, and senior Laura Clinton
overtook a Georgian Court runner late in the race to finish 14th.

Junior Stuart Udis (third) and freshman Bobby Torphy (seventh) placed in the top 10 for the men.

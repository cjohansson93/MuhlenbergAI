Baseball, Men's Tennis Fall to Fords; Women's Lacrosse Loses at Drew


For the second time in eight days, the Muhlenberg baseball team made a comeback from an early deficit at home, but this time the Mules couldn't quite catch up and fell to Haverford, 11-6.

Last Tuesday, Muhlenberg rallied from a 6-0 first-inning deficit to beat Ursinus, 9-8. The Fords, who are receiving votes in both national Division III polls, scored five times in the top of the first in this game.

Just like they did against Ursinus, the Mules (6-19-1, 3-4) chipped away. The scored once in the third, three times in the fifth and twice in the sixth to close to within one at 7-6.

In the bottom of the seventh, still trailing by a run, Muhlenberg loaded the bases with one out. Haverford (20-4, 5-2) turned a double play to end the inning, however, then tacked on four runs in the last two frames.

Junior Jesse Nusbaum was 2-for-5 with two RBI. Senior Bobby Spindler, sophomore Joseph Vila and freshman John Scuderi also had two hits. Scuderi also walked twice and is hitting .462 over his last six games.

Men's lacrosseoff targetat Haverford



Instead of a case of the Mondays, the Muhlenberg men's lacrosse team is suffering from a case of the Wednesdays. 

For the second time in a week, a hot opposing goalie cooled down the Mule offense to hand Muhlenberg a one-goal loss.

The Mules held a 38-19 advantage in shots and outshot Haverford in every quarter. But the Ford netminder finished with 19 saves to earn the 6-5 win. 




Last Wednesday, Muhlenberg outshot Swarthmore, 40-29, only to see the Garnet goalie make 20 saves in the Mules' 7-6 loss. 

Haverford, ranked No. 11 in the latest USILA poll, jumped out to a 3-0 lead midway through the first quarter. But thanks to back-to-back goals from sophomores Michael Carpetto and Doug Rheiner, the Mules closed the gap to one.

The Fords (8-3, 3-2) added two more in the second quarter before Corey Aferiat scored 1:30 before the break to make it a two-goal game at the half.

The two teams traded goals in the third frame, and Muhlenbergs defense tightened.

The Mules (3-7, 1-4) held Haverford scoreless during the final 27 minutes, and only allowed one goal in the entire second half. But Muhlenberg had trouble finding the back of the net on offense. 

Muhlenberg fired off 10 shots in the final quarter before junior Alex Ardolino finally ended the drought with 30 seconds to play. But it was too little, too late as Haverford won the ensuing faceoff and ran out the clock.

Senior Tom Brant (above) led the Mule defensive effort with six ground balls and two caused turnovers.

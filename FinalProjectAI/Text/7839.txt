Men's Basketball Falls on Last-Second Shot
 Monday, January 5, 2015







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team took King’s down to the wire, as Brandon LaRose finished a tough drive with a lefty layup to give the Mules a one-point lead with 36 seconds to go.

Unfortunately, the Mules would be on the wrong end of a banked floater with 0.4 seconds to go, losing in their first game since the calendar flipped to 2015 in a 56-55 nail-biter.

LaRose, a 6-4 sophomore, and junior Alec Stavetski led the scoring for the Mules with 11 points apiece.  Stavetski (right) hit one of his three triples early in the second half to give Muhlenberg a five-point lead. That would be the largest lead either team would hold on the evening, indicative of just how evenly matched the two teams were. Joining Stavetski with three treys was sophomore Jon Schreer, who also grabbed five boards and dished three assists.

Trading baskets in the first half, King’s took a 28-26 lead into the locker room. The Monarchs and Mules (6-5) combined to hit the first seven shots of the game, and early on the game was looking like it was going to be a track meet. John Hunter was one of the main reasons the scoring barrage slowed for Kingâs (7-5): He grabbed eight of his nine rebounds on the defensives, swatting away four shots and swiping three steals.
 
Muhlenberg seemed in good shape after Hunter stole an entry pass with nine seconds to go, but a missed free throw gave King’s one last possession to try and steal the win at home.

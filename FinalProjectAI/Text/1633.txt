The 2006 edition of the annual guide lists only about 15 percent of the four-year colleges in America and two Canadian colleges. Each school is featured in a two-page profile, and the top 20 colleges in various categories are listed, based on student surveys.  The Muhlenberg College profile includes high praise regarding its academics and extracurricular activities, especially highlighting its theatre department which Princeton Review ranks 18 th in the nation.
According to Robert Franek, vice president for publishing at The Princeton Review, "The main factor in our selection of schools in the book was our high regard for their academic programs. We evaluated them based on institutional data we collect about the schools, feedback from students at them and visits to schools over the years. We also considered the opinions of independent college counselors, students and parents we talk to and survey. Finally, we worked to have a wide representation of colleges in the book by region, size, selectivity and character.
The ranking is based on a survey of 110,000 students attending the colleges in the book. Students rated their schools on several topics and reported on their campus experiences at them. Ranking list categories range from best professors, administration and campus food to lists based on student body political leanings, interests in sports and other aspects of campus life.

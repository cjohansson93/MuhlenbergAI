Weekly Community Update from President Harring
Tuesday, April 14, 2020

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
This past week we continued to share information on our COVID-19 web page, including the posting of information regarding the room and board credit refunds. We also launched a new Community in Action web page that highlights our stories about students, faculty, staff and alumni and features a continuously updated collection of posts from social media that demonstrate how the Muhlenberg community is staying strong and helping those around us. You can also find 32 Muhlenberg background images to use during your Zoom meetings or classes.
In my first weekly email I introduced the presquestions@muhlenberg.edu email address and invited you to ask questions that I could answer via video on Thursdays of each week. Well, weâve needed to make a few adjustments to that plan. Beginning with this message, each of my weekly emails will also contain the video with answers to your questionsâhere is this weekâs video update:

When we review the questions you send, we look for themes so I can try and provide answers to some of the questions that many of you raise. If you have specific questions for a College office, please contact that office for a more detailed answer. Contact information for relevant offices can be found on the College website.
Before I share updates on recent decisions, I want to take a moment and thank the College personnel who continue to work on our campus to provide for those students still in housing. Our Campus Safety officers and staff have been absolutely amazing. Not only do they continue to patrol our campus, they also assist Housing & Residence Life staff to make sure urgent requests for items like medications or course materials are met. And the contributions of our staff in dining services and plant operations are deeply appreciated by myself and the rest of the senior administration. Thank you so much.   
Many of the decisions regarding this semester are now behind us and we are beginning to focus our thinking on the summer and beyond. I want to share some of the most recent information to make sure you are up to date.
I am so grateful for the dedication of all Muhlenberg faculty and staff and was glad that we were able to announce last week we have extended the commitment to pay wages for all employees, in accordance with standard work schedules, through May 23, 2020. 
We previously announced that we would postpone commencement and related activities. We have set a planned date of October 17 and 18 to hold an on-campus ceremony and baccalaureate program. We are also in the process of completing plans to celebrate the end of the academic year. For seniors and graduating students in our School of Continuing Studies, the College will provide you with your cap and gown at no cost, which we will mail to you along with a few other items to help celebrate your accomplishments.
Later this week, seniors and graduates of the School of Continuing Studies will receive an email with more details and a survey that will help us shape both the end of year and fall activities.
We have all seen the recent news articles about âZoombombingâ and some of us have even experienced these cyber-intrusions. The Muhlenberg Office of Information Technology (OIT) takes the security of Zoom and the safety of your virtual classroom spaces very seriously. OIT continues to review Zoom security, push out updates to college owned devices and make recommendations to our community aimed at keeping these virtual spaces as secure as possible. We will add OIT information of safe practices while using Zoom to the COVID-19 information this week. In the meantime, if you have any questions please contact the support desk at 484-664-3566 or supportdesk@muhlenberg.edu.
This past week we made the decision to move all summer courses online. Typically the summer sessions offer a mix of on-campus and online courses. By making the decision now, both our faculty and students can be better prepared for courses intended to be taught online. This summer catalog includes a selection of 80 courses from across the curriculum. 
Faculty and students who planned to conduct summer research can continue their plans if they are able to complete the work remotely. If the research needs to be conducted on campus, it should be postponed pending review of the campus situation.
Before I close, I want to acknowledge the members of our community who have been deeply impacted by the crisis. We have all had our lives disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but many among us are feeling personal loss. As a community, we share in the heartbreak that some of our students, faculty, staff and alumni have experienced within their own families or personal circle. Please know that our hearts are with you and that we are here to do all we can to support you.
Sincerely,Kathy HarringInterim President

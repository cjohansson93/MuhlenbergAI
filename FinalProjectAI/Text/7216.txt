The Muhlenberg track and field teams closed out their indoor season by sending three women to two meets in the Boston area.

On Thursday, seniors Stephanie Carnevale and Amber Lee Wojtkowski ran the 60-meter hurdles at the Tufts Last Chance Meet.
Carnevale finish fourth, running a season-best time of 9.08 in the preliminaries, and Wojtkowski (right) was sixth.

The two hurdlers then moved on to the ECAC Championships at the Reggie Lewis Center in Boston. Carnevale posted the eighth-best qualifying time and came in sixth
in the final. It was her second straight year placing at the ECAC Championships; last year, she was third.

Sophomore Claire Thornton competed in the 800 meters for the Mules, who are off until their outdoor season is scheduled to start on March 29 at Lafayette.

Instructions for In-Person Studies
 




Informed Consent Template for In Person Studies


Unless an exemption is explicitly discussed and approved in your Ethics Proposal, your study must include written informed consent.



 
 



Using SONA for LOC Studies


If your study awards LOC credit, you will solicit participants and grant credit by using SONA, the LOC Participant Sign-up website. Carefully follow the Sona/LOC System Researcher Instructions for In Person Studies.



 
 



Debriefing Template for In Person Studies


All participants in all studies must be provided with a written debriefing form that contains the experimenterâs on-contact information.



 

 




Record Keeping


Researchers should keep a record of the names of all participants and the date of participation. This record should be stored separately from participant data. Signed informed consent forms should be turned in to the Psychology Department office (Moyer 227) for safe-keeping

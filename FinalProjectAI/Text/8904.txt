          Biology
  








Biology 
Enrolling in BIO 160: Foundations of Biological Inquiry (preferably in fall semester) and in BIO 165: From Ecosystems to Organisms (typically spring semester) is strongly recommended and expected for first-year students planning to major in biology.  One section of BIO 160 is also offered in the Spring, if Fall scheduling makes it unusually difficult to enroll.
Concurrent enrollment in CHM 100: Introductory Chemistry or CHM 103: General Chemistry I is also strongly recommended.
BIO 165: From Ecosystems to Organisms may not be taken without BIO 160: Foundations of Biological Inquiry (as prerequisite or concurrently).
Chemistry 
CHM 103: General Chemistry I, CHM 104: General Chemistry II or CHM 100: Introductory Chemistry if MSAT is <600.   
Students who are considering a major in the natural sciences, and/or prehealth cousework will take a chemistry placement exam.  Inform students that they will not be able to register for CHM 100 or 103 until they have completed the placement exam.  A recommendation will be made for each student, and the student should be informed by their advisor whether they should take CHM 100 or 103; the student can ultmately decide which course to roster.
Most students will be recommended for CHM 103: the following are indicators used to recommend that a student take CHM 100 in the fall semester prior to taking CHM 103:  MSAT score < 600, MACT < 27, low chemistry placement score and/or low confidence in taking a college-level chemistry course, math placement lower than Calculus I.  Levels and grades in high school science and mathematics courses are also considered.
Note that if students take CHM 100 in the fall, they can take 103 in the spring semester of their first year.  They need to complete CHM 104 (General Chemistry II prior to taking Organic Chemistry, and some upper level biology courses (CHM 104 can be taken concurrently with BIO 175).  One option is to take CHM 104 over the summer to complete Organic in the sophomore year.
CHM 104 is a co-requisite or pre-requisite for BIO 175, meaning that CHM 104 and BIO 175 can be taken at the same time.  BIO 175 is now taught in both the Fall and Spring semesters, adding flexibility.

          Dance
  








Prospective Dance Majors and Minors SHOULD register for: 
DNC-186 Dance Practices 1
This course will only be offered in the fall and is specifically designed for first year dancers.  It is vital that students do not put the course off until their sophomore year.  All first year students considering a major or minor should register this as their first choice of courses.
BIO-102  Concepts of Biology: Biology of Movement 
This topic of Concepts only!  No other âConcepts of Biologyâ class counts toward the Dance major. Recommended fall of freshman year or fall of sophomore year. 
OR
BIO-160: Foundations of Biological Inquiry (fall) & 
BIO-165: From Ecosystems to Organisms (spring)
Dance students planning to double major in Biology should enroll in BIO-160 in the fall and plan to take BIO-165 in the Spring.  BIO 165 counts towards the Dance major.
First Year Seminar
Language or other GAR requirements
Notes to first year advisors 
Certain language classes conflict with DNC-186. If this is the case, it is better to delay the language start to spring semester or sophomore year. 
The (AR) credit may be earned by non-majors and minors by taking two dance technique courses in two different idioms during the same semester.  For example, ballet and jazz or modern and jazz tap. Dance majors may also want to add a (.5) technique class in addition to DNC-186 â this is fine. 
Dance technique class levels:
Level I â beginners or those with limited training Level II â lower-intermediate students with prior training Level III â intermediate for those with several years of training Level IV â advanced-intermediate for those with significant achievement  (requires chair approval) Level V â advanced (requires chair approval)

Economics majors are required to take one Calculus course.  Students who have not completed the Calculus requirement are encouraged to do so by the end of their sophomore year.  
First-year students contemplating majoring in economics should plan to take the intermediate theory courses, ECN 220, 221: Intermediate Microeconomic Theory and ECN 222, 223: Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory, and MTH 119: Statistical Analysis no later than the junior year.  
For students planning on taking graduate work in economics, it is strongly recommended that additional courses in mathematics, beyond Calculus I, be taken.  The following mathematics courses are especially recommended: MTH 122: Calculus II, MTH 223: Calculus III, MTH 226: Linear Algebra, and MTH 227: Differential Equations.
First-year students considering a major in Economics are encouraged to consult with an economics faculty member early in their first year.

A student considering medical school as a career path usually takes two science courses in both their first and second semesters at Muhlenberg.  There are two recommended paths for a studentâs first semester:
Path 1
BIO 160 Foundations of Biological Inquiry
CHM 103 General Chemistry I
or
Path 2
PHY 121 General Physics (Calculus I is a pre- or corequisite)
CHM 103 General Chemistry I
The major a student intends to study influences which path he/she takes. Students intending to pursue a major in biology, biochemistry or neuroscience should follow path 1.  For all other majors, either path is appropriate and should be chosen according to interest and experience. 
Sometimes a student is advised to take CHM 100 Introductory Chemistry in her or his first semester.  In order to stay on track for the MCAT in the junior year, this student should complete CHM 103 in the spring of the first year and CHM 104 in summer school before the start of the second year.  CHM 104 General Chemistry II is a prerequisite for CHM 201/CHM 203 Organic Chemistry I and a prerequisite or corequisite for BIO 175 From Organisms to Molecules - both courses are essential preparation for the MCAT.  Delaying CHM 104 beyond the summer before sophomore year could result in a delay in the medical school application process.
In rare instances an incoming student chooses to take just one science class in the first year.  Any student making this choice should be aware that he or she may not have time to complete all of the preparatory courses for the MCAT in spring of the junior year.

Students should be encouraged to choose any major that interests them. 
Traditionally, students admitted to law school have come from almost every academic discipline.  Students may choose to major in subjects that are considered to be traditional preparation for law school, such as history, English, philosophy, political science, economics or business, or they may focus their undergraduate studies in areas as diverse as art, music, science and mathematics, computer science, or education.  Whatever the major, students are encouraged to pursue an area of study that interests and challenges them, while taking advantage of opportunities to develop critical thinking, research and writing skills, and oral communication.  Students are also recommended to seek significant experiences in and outside the classroom which are devoted to improving fairness, the quality of justice, and a commitment to public service.

First-Year Seminar
Mathematics 
MTH 119: Statistical Analysis or MTH 121: Calculus I (or above)
To be taken fall or spring semester of the first year as a prerequisite for PSY 103: Psychological Statistics, which is typically taken in the subsequent semester.  PSY 103 should be taken no later than the first semester of the sophomore year followed by PSY 104: Research Methods, which should be taken by the end of the sophomore year.
PSY 103 is a prerequisite for PSY 104
Psychology 
PSY 101: Introductory Psychology
Could be taken either first or second semester. If taken first semester, the student may take some other psychology courses toward the major requirements in the spring.*
NOTES:  If schedule permits because of opting out of requirements, students might be encouraged to take courses in the natural sciences (e.g., biology or neuroscience), in other social sciences (e.g., sociology or anthropology), or in Humanities courses addressing the human condition.            
*Suggested courses include:
PSY 212: Learning and Behavior PSY 220: Social Psychology PSY 230: Child Development
(Students who have received Advanced Placement for PSY 101: Introductory Psychology should be advised to register for one of these courses).
Since the prerequisite for Psych Stats is either Math 119 or Cal I, students who place into Cal II or higher would be considered to have satisfied the math prerequisite for Psych Stats.  There are currently seats open for the course, and we believe that the students will have sufficient mathematical sophistication to handle the quantitative parts of the course.  HOWEVER, Psych Stats also has a major writing component, in which students are introduced to APA writing style and application. Thus, students considering taking Psych Stats in their first semester should be asked about their level of comfort with the amount and type of writing that they will be required to do. If the student isn't confident in their writing ability, they should consider delaying Psych Stats until they already have some college-level writing under their belts.
Students scoring a 4 or 5 on the AP Psych Test need not take Intro to Psych, depending on their golas and circumstances. They would be better served taking a 200-level psychology course from the list in the advising manual, or to focus on the general academic curriculum and take a psychology course second semester.

          Religious Professions
  








No specific major is required for education and training for a religious profession.  Study in Religion Studies, Jewish Studies, English, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Business, Media & Communication, and Education is recommended.  Some religions require that, while in college and before entering a graduate-level program, a student participates in a discernment and formation process. Contact your particular denomination for details.  For further information, contact Chaplain Kristen Glass Perez.

          Theatre
  








The top priority for all first-year theatre students should be THR 105: Performance & Society. This is the introductory, foundational course for the Theatre major. It includes both seminar and studio elements, so students need to enroll in both the Seminar section and the accompanying Laboratory.  All prospective Theatre majors should do their utmost to roster this course.  We beleive we have enough seats to meet demand, but if a student is shut out of the course (or just can't make the schedule puzzle work), the course will be offered again in the Spring.
If a student is unable to roster THR 105 or would like to take an additional Theatre couse, there are several good options.  All of thse count toward the Theatre major.
LLC 410: Early Modern Spanish Drama (1 unit, taught in English.  Despite the course number, this course would be a great option for First Year Students.)
THR 151: Voice and Speech for the Actor (.5 units)
THR 155: Movement for the Actor (.5 units)
THR 166: Stagecraft: Scenic Techniques (.5 units)
THR 167: Stagecraft: Costume Techniques (.5 units)
THR 183: Fundamentals of Musical Theatre Performance (.5 units)
THR 188: Stagecraft: Properties (.5 units)
THR 220: Stage Management 1 (1 unit; requires concurrent enrollment in THR 105)
Students who articulate an interest in Stage Management should be encouraged to takeTHR 220 their first semester.
WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, PROSPECTIVE THEATRE MAJORS SHOULD NOT ROSTER THE FOLLOWING COURSE:

THR 150: Intro to the Art of Acting â This course is not intended for Theatre majors, and it does not fulfill a major requirement. Experience suggests thatsome eager students will express interest in the course.  Please steer them away from it.  It would be appropriate ONLY for prospective majors who have had little prior experience with acting, and even then a better option would be any of the 100 level performance oriented courses listed above (THR 151, THR 155, and THR 183).
However, THR 150 is a great course for non-Theatre major interested in fulfilling the "AR" distribution requirement.  Highly recommended for this purpose.

If your advisees have questions about the Theatre major requirements, a helpful guide is available on our website.
If you have questions about a particular student on th day of advising, you are welcome to contact Jim Peck, incoming Chair of Theatre.  He will be available all advising days, and the best way to contact him is via a text message at 610-703-3777.






          Womenâs and Gender Studies (minor only)
  








Director: Dr. Francesca Coppa
The WST Program at Muhlenberg offers a six-course minor that students can combine with any major.  Recent WST graduates have majored in biology, psychology, mathematics, media and communication, philosophy, sociology, history, English, religion studies, and theatre.  
They will need to take WST 202. This core WST class teaches students the international history of Womenâs and Gender Studies and the latest thinking in these areas: feminism, sexuality studies, masculinity studies, and queer studies.  (This course is full for Fall 2021)
First year students curious about exploring Womenâs & Gender Studies (which encompasses topics of sexuality studies, intersectional analysis, cultural studies, queer theory and more) should try to take one of the classes on the WST Electives list during their first year.
Minor Requirements
To complete the Womenâs and Gender Studies minor, students must take WST 202, Topics in Womenâs and Gender Studies (or an equivalent course designated by the Director) and five additional courses from the list of approved classes. A WST internship, study abroad, and independent study classes can also count toward the minor.  In addition to the Womenâs & Gender Studies courses (listed below), special topics courses cross-listed with WST are available on a semester-by-semester basis. 
Courses from WST Electives list that DO NOT have prerequisites and DO have seats for incoming first-year students:
AAS 383: Global Black Lit (may be full)
AFS 101: Intro to Africana Studies
ATH 250: Anthro of Gender & Sexuality (may be full)
ENG 287: Spc Top: Trans & Gender Variant Literature
HST 281: Special Topic: Eliza Hamiltonâs America (may be full)
NCS 389: Special Topic: Neurobiological of Sex Differences (requires permission of instructor, but interested students should email leahwilson@muhlenberg.edu for more information or for permission to register)
PHL 227 Philosophy of Feminism (may be full)
Students with previous gender studies experience might try PSC 383: Spc Top: Critical Race Feminist Theory, which recommend but does not require past courses.
*Note for any students who express an interest in a Self-Designed Major in Gender & Sexuality Studies: The students should contact Dr. Coppa. There are several students currently completing a Self-Designed Major in Gender and Sexuality Studies through the Womenâs and Gender Studies program with advising by WST faculty.

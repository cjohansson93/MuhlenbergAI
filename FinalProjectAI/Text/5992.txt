The Muhlenberg womens tennis team opened its 2011-12 season at the TCNJ Lions’ Fall Kickoff on Saturday. The event was a three-way competition between the Mules, The College of New Jersey and 
New York University.

Sophomores Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman (left) had the most success for Muhlenberg, winning two of their three doubles matches.

Senior Zack Meyers shot in the 70s in both rounds to lead the Muhlenberg men’s golf team at the Guy W. Kuhn Invitational, hosted by Allegheny.

Meyers shot a 2-over 74 on Sunday and followed that up with a 78 on Monday.

The Mules sent only three golfers to the tournament, so they did not have a team score.

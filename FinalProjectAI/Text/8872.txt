Kelly Powell, RN ‌
Staff Nurse
Background Kelly joined the Muhlenberg College Health Center in September 2000.  She received her nursing education from The Allentown Hospital School of Nursing.  She completed her sciences, sociology and psychology credits right here at Muhlenberg… never thinking she would someday call this campus home!  She worked full time at Sacred Heart Hospital in staff and management positions from 1986-2000.

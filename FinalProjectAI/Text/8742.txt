Lindsey Nagy, assistant professor of economics, works with a Muhlenberg student.
Muhlenberg College announced an agreement with American Universityâs Kogod School of Business that allows Muhlenbergâs outstanding students to pursue scholarships and receive preferential access to Americanâs masterâs of science in finance (MSF) program.
The collaboration gives Muhlenberg economics and finance studentsâwho complete required courses, meet specific academic criteria and have the recommendation of a designated faculty memberâpreferred access to Americanâs MSF program and eligibility for a $10,000 tuition scholarship.
âThis is a wonderful opportunity for our top students in economics and finance,â said Art Raymond, professor of economics and finance. âThis agreement provides Muhlenbergâs best economics and finance students preferential access to a highly competitive masterâs program in finance geared towards various professional certifications. Due to Americanâs location in the nation's capital, students also have access to significant internship opportunities available during study.
Americanâs MSF program offers an innovative and intellectually sophisticated curriculum that prepares graduates for leadership positions in the financial sector. Students have the opportunity to craft their own degree with courses in investment banking, financial intermediation in emerging markets, investment analysis and more. The focused curriculum also prepares students for professional certifications, such as Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA), among others.

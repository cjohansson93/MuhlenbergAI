We now offer two ways for alumni to help students discover career paths or reinforce interest in an industry - as a Shadow Host or as an Externship Host.As a Shadow Host, you host a student for one work day over winter break, spring break or summer to give a glimpse into your workplace. As an Externship Host, you host a student for 3-5 work days over the first week in January to provide a more in-depth experience for students by involving them in projects, research, etc. in order for them to learn what itâs like to work in your industry.Experiencing the inside of an industry first-hand provides new perspectives and helps students to either discover new career paths or reinforce existing interest in an industry. 
If you have a shadow or project opportunity that students could participate in or work on, please email Jessica Deemer '21 jessicadeemer@muhlenberg.edu

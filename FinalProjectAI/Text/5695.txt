Home Match Preview

Catch ’Em While You Can —
Wrestling Home Schedule Limited


After weighing in for its match against Scranton on Wednesday, the Muhlenberg wrestling team might want to drive around the block a few times so it feels 
ready for a real competition.

Wednesday’s contest will the first home match of the season for the Mules, and they have only one other, next Thursday against King’s. By contrast, the team is scheduled to wrestle at Ursinus four

times, twice in dual meets and twice in tournaments, including the Centennial Conference Championships.

“It’s nice to not have to travel and be on the bus for so long,” said senior heavyweight 
Joe Tartar. 

In spite of the constant road tripping, Muhlenberg is off to a good start. The Mules have competed in five tournaments and two dual matches, crowning nine champions in the tournaments and wrestling 27th-ranked New York University close in a dual.

Junior Rob Kein leads the team in wins with a 19-4 record and placed in the top six in all five tournaments, winning at King’s and Williams. He is ranked eighth in Division III and lost a two-point decision to the third-ranked 149-pounder in the championship final of Saturday’s Washington and Lee Invitational.

Junior Billy Hall, who like Kein moved up a class after qualifying for nationals last year, has an 18-3 record at 141 and placed third or higher in all five tourneys. Tartar, the team’s third returning national qualifier, is 16-5 with eight wins (including five pins) in his last nine bouts.

A pair of juniors also have impressive records. Matt Horn (184) is 16-4 with two tournament titles and is tied with Tartar for the team lead in pins (eight). Justin Fitch won his first career title at Washington and Lee to run his season record to 15-4.

“We’ve done well in the tournaments,” remarked Tartar. “It seems like everybody’s in the hang of it and has their weight under control, and getting ready to finish out the season.”

But not before putting in a rare appearance at home, first against a Scranton team that finished fifth, two places behind Muhlenberg, at Washington and Lee.

“[Fans] only have two chances  to come see us at home,” said Tartar. “People come to support all the other Muhlenberg teams; they might as well show the wrestling team some support.”

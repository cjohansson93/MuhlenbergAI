Campus Community Message from Health and Counseling Services
Monday, February 10, 2020

Dear students, faculty, and staff,
With ever-developing information emerging about the novel Coronavirus, we wanted to inform you of the collegeâs response to date.  We will continue to send you updates as needed.  Thank you for your support with keeping our campus healthy.
Actions Muhlenberg College has taken:

The collegeâs Emergency Preparedness Committee is actively monitoring developments around the coronavirus and coordinating campus resources, responses and communications. 
 In addition to following the recommendations of the CDC, we continue to consult regularly with the Allentown Health Bureau.
General Flu activity is high in the U.S. and expected to continue for weeks. The Health Center is evaluating and treating students with influenza symptoms.  Anyone who has not received a flu vaccine this season should consider getting the vaccine.
Individuals visiting the Health Center are being screened for recent international travel.
Plant Operations has increased cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces, buildings, and residence halls.
We have reminded our community that anyone who is ill or thinks they may be ill to stay home from class and from work and seek medical care, as necessary.

Preventive actions our community should take to help prevent the spread of respiratory infections:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Finally, as we are soon approaching Spring Break, we encourage you to review any travel plans you might have.  Check into any travel restrictions, travel advisories or any other recommendations being offered.  
If you would like to consult with someone about your travel plans or need to consider adjusting your plans or staying on campus, please consider contacting Tom Janis in International Support Services to discuss.
Thank you,Brynnmarie DorseyExecutive Director, Health and Counseling Services

 Womens tennis preview
 Mens tennis

 womens lacrosse downed by devils


	


Trailing by five midway through the second half, the offense picked up for the Muhlenberg womens lacrosse team as the Mules made a late run at FDU-Florham.

But the comeback bid came up short as the Mules ran out of time and suffered just their second non-conference loss in the past six seasons, 16-13, to the Devils.

After the two teams combined for five goals in the first 2:30, the respective offenses slowed from their breakneck pace. FDU-Florham (3-1) took control and opened up an 8-5 lead with less than 10 minutes to play in the first half.

But the Mules (4-1) responded when senior Danielle Rosen and sophomore Molly Davin scored back-to-back goals to pull Muhlenberg to within one at the break.

The Devils came out hot after halftime and scored six of the next eight goals before the Mules started their comeback.

Rosen scored twice in less than three minutes to pull the Mules to within three before FDU-Florham added a quick insurance goal.

Junior  Angela Napoletano scored six minutes later and Rosen added another tally to make it 15-13 with two minutes to play. But Muhlenberg would not find the net again, and the Devils added a free position shot in the final five seconds to seal the game.

Rosen tied her career high with six goals and also added two assists, while Napoletano (right) finished with five goals and an assist for her fifth hat trick of the season

Defensively, Alexandra Franck picked up a team-high four ground balls, and freshman  Kaitlyn McCaffrey caused three turnovers.

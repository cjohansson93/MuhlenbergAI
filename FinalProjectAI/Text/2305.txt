Dorothy Roberts, George A.

Roberts will address issues of biopower, race and gender; health disparities among racial minorities; sexuality and law; and socioeconomic regulation of sexual health.
Roberts' most recent publications include Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Recreate Race in the Twenty-first Century and Sex, Power, and Taboo: Gender and HIV in the Caribbean and Beyond. Her groundbreaking work in law and public policy focuses on urgent contemporary issues in health, social justice and bioethics, especially as they impact the lives of women, children and African-Americans. She is the author of more than 80 scholarly articles and book chapters, as well as a co-editor of six books on such topics as constitutional law and women and the law. She has expertise in the areas of family law, criminal law, bioethics, civil rights law and juvenile justice.
This lecture is part of the Center for Ethic's Sex, Ethics, and Pleasure Politics, a series of special events and thematic lectures that aims to develop a comprehensive sexual ethics for the campus community. This lecture is free and open to the public. For more series information, visit the Center for Ethics.

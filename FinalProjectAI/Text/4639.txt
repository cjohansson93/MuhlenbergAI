horowitz named player of the week



Junior Mike Horowitz of the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Horowitz made a season-high 13 saves to help the Mules beat Swarthmore, 9-8, despite a 44-33 deficit in shots. 
He also stopped nine shots in Muhlenberg’s 10-9 overtime win against No. 13 Haverford – the program’s first win against a nationally ranked team.

For the season, Horowitz has an 8.49 goals-against average and .532 save percentage.

The two one-goal wins gave the Mules their first 3-1 start in the CC ever. They are currently tied with Ursinus for second place in the CC, behind only third-ranked Gettysburg.

Asian Students Association
Asian Students Association (ASA) is an organization that celebrates the Asian cultures represented by Muhlenberg students and we are open to the Muhlenberg community.
 
In the past, our club has attended conferences, such as ECAASU, and organized campus-wide events. Many of these events highlight Asian holidays, including the Mid-Autumn Festival, Lunar New Year, and Diwali. ASA also plans trips to explore Asian culture and diversity off-campus such as the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. and visiting the MET Art Gallery in NYC. 
ASA is also established to welcome international and exchange students. We hope to share and learn from one another's experiences, while developing a social haven for those away from home.

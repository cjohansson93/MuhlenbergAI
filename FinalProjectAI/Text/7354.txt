Women's Tennis Season Ends in CC First Round
 Wednesday, April 30, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team’s season came to an end with a 5-0 loss at Swarthmore in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs.

The fifth-seeded Mules, making their first postseason appearance since 2011, finished the spring campaign with a record of 8-5.

Muhlenberg defeated Swarthmore, 6-3, eight days ago but was unable to gain a foothold in the rematch, played indoors due to the torrential rainstorms that washed out the region on Wednesday. The fourth-seeded Garnet advanced to meet top-seeded Johns Hopkins, ranked third in Division III, in Saturday’s semifinals. 

Senior Nina Sanders won the first set, 7-5, at second singles moments before the Garnet reached five wins to end the match. 

Senior  Gabriela Contino (right) and junior Jennifer Goldberg put up a fight at third doubles. The tandem trailed 7-4 before staving off two match points to close to within 7-6, but Swarthmore was able to hold serve to close out the doubles sweep.

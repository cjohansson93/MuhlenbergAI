Professor of History Ettinger 300B 484-664-3538
Education: Ph.D. in History with Honors, Indiana University, Bloomington 1996 M. A. in History, Indiana University, Blomington, 1989 B. A. in History and Economics, Trinity University, San Antonio, 1987.
Teaching Fields: Modern European History France Germany Italy World Wars Cultural History
I am a cultural historian of France and Italy. My earliest publications were a series of articles on the popular press in France and Italy. Bucknell University Press published my first book on the popular press in 19th-century France, Murder in Parisian Streets, in 2006. My most recent work deals with the representation of World War II in cinema and national memory. This work has resulted in papers and articles and it will lead to the completion of a larger book project. In all these works I have been particularly interested in the ways that media shape our perceptions of our world and more specifically of its political and social institutions, our gender relations and our ideals.
I teach a broad range of courses at Muhlenberg College, including two introductions to history and a series of surveys of European history that span from 1787 to the present. I also offer focused courses on many subjects, ranging from the French Revolution and Napoleon to Sex and Gender in Europe. When I teach our advanced Reading and Research Seminars for our majors and minors, I focus the courses on World War II in national memory and cinema. My courses sometimes reflect my research interests, but they range far beyond those to address political, intellectual, diplomatic, military, social, gender and cultural history.
Courses Taught: Revolution & the Birth of Modern Europe (c.1787-1919) Civil War, Holocaust, Crisis: Europe 1900-1945 From Cold War to Unification: Europe 1945-Present The French Revolution and Napoleon France from Napoleon to the Great War, 1814-1914 Gender & Sex in European History World War II in Cinema

Field hockey shuts out bryn mawr



Muhlenberg-Moravian Women’s Soccer – Nothing to It


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team left Varsity Field with a scoreless tie against Moravian for the third time in the last six meetings.

Moravian had a chance to score early in the first half off a corner. The ball was in the net, but junior Ashley O’Grady was standing in the back right corner and saved the Mules as she headed the ball out.

The Mules (7-3-1) dominated regulation, outshooting the Greyhounds 20-6, and had ample opportunity to score.

The overtime was much closer with Muhlenberg taking four shots to Moravian’s two.

The series between the two now stands 7-5-3, in favor of Moravian. Only one of the 15 games was decided by more than one goal (Moravian’s 2-0 win in 2005) and neither team has scored more than two goals in a game.

The Matte Award contest for 2008-09 now stands at 3½ for Muhlenberg and ½ for Moravian.

The nip in the air can only mean that playoff season is right around the corner for fall sports, and the Muhlenberg field 



Notarianni’s seven-point night brought her career total to 52 on 24 goals and four assists.



hockey team geared up for the stretch run with an impressive 8-0 win against Bryn Mawr.

The Mules (4-7, 1-3) scored four times in each half and outshot 

the Owls (1-10, 0-6) by a 35-4 margin. The comfortable margin was very welcome for Muhlenberg, which had come out on the short end of close games in its first three Centennial Conference contests.

Junior Nicki Notarianni turned a close game into a one-sided one singlehandedly, scoring the first three goals in a span of 4:31 midway through the first half. It was her first career hat trick and the second by a Mule player in three weeks. Junior Tara Cohn, who recorded her hat trick against Moravian, contributed two goals and an assist to the Bryn Mawr effort.

Junior Kristen Sabia and freshman Jillian Katz each chipped in with a goal and an assist as Muhlenberg defeated Bryn Mawr for the 12th straight year.

The 8-0 final represented the Mules’ biggest shutout win since 2000, when they beat Bryn Mawr by the same count.

Banner Day for Women's Lacrosse: Ranking, Honor, Win
 Monday, March 17, 2014 - page 2







					 




Luck – of the Irish or any other type – had nothing to do with a tremendous St. Patrick’s Day for the
Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team.

In the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association Division III poll released in the morning, the Mules 
received votes. About an hour later, junior Stephanie Umbach was named offensive player of the week by
the Centennial Conference.

Muhlenberg capped off the day with its third straight win, a 20-4 defeat of undermanned Smith.

The Mules (5-1) were the seventh team listed under “also receiving votes” after the top 20 in the IWLCA poll, which
includes half of the 10 CC teams: Franklin & Marshall (No. 4) and Gettysburg (No. 5) are in the top five, and
Dickinson and Haverford joined Muhlenberg in receiving votes. It is the Mules’ first time receiving 
votes since 2009, when they were recognized after an 8-1 start. The website laxpower.com has Muhlenberg 
ranked 25th out of 246 teams in Division III.

The lone loss for the Mules is to Montclair State, which is receiving votes in the IWLCA poll and is eighth in the
laxpower computer rankings. Muhlenberg owns a win over Lebanon Valley, another team receiving votes.

McTamany honored her Irish heritage by wearing a green mouthpiece. Her paternal great-grandmother was the first of her ancestors to make the journey from Ireland to America in 1912. She was supposed to be on the Titanic, but couldn't get a ticket and journeyed on the next ship.




Umbach (right) scored 16 points on 15 goals and an assist in two Muhlenberg wins last week to earn the CC honor for the second time in her career. She tied her career high 
with seven goals, including the 100th of her career, against FDU-Florham, then set a new high three days 
later with eight vs. RIT. Umbach also totaled six ground balls, nine draw controls and nine caused turnovers 
in the two games.

Umbach added six more goals against Smith, which suited up only 10 players due to injuries. The Mules led 9-1 after 10 minutes and substituted 
freely for the rest of the game as every player saw action.

The Mules’ victory, their third in six days, was also their seventh straight at home, breaking the school record set in 2007 and 2008. Muhlenberg scored 16 goals in the first half, eclipsing the mark of 15 set three times previously, the most recent against Eastern last year.

Umbach, who scored four consecutive goals during a stretch of less than three and a half minutes early in the first half, netted at least six for the third straight game. Once again, she got plenty of help from senior Michelle Certosimo and sophomore Casey Armstrong. The former finished with three goals and an assist, while the latter added three goals and two assists for her third consecutive game with at least five points.

Freshman Stephanie D’Ascoli scored two goals, while senior Ally Shaffer and junior Kayleigh Thies each recorded a goal and two assists. Junior Sarah McTamany chipped in with a goal and an assist, and freshmen Kelsey Nagle and Nora Fisher each scored a goal. 

Senior Rachel Chinman capped the scoring with her third career goal, and sophomore Arielle Sherman recorded her first career assist.

Senior Kaitlyn McCaffrey led the defense with three caused turnovers and added three draw controls, while freshman Sara Allison stopped three shots in the second half, including an impressive kick-save on a free position shot.

Trexler Library Owned Materials
For enhanced safety and convenience, Trexler Library has implemented a Contactless Checkout and Pick-up service for our students, faculty, and staff members to obtain physical library materials. 
Our online catalog, Encompass Search enables patrons to virtually browse our shelves and explore what we have to offer. This makes it easy for you to place a hold on items you would like to check out. Placing a hold through Encompass Search must be done before items can be checked out. Please view the PDF instructions or video overview for a detailed look at this quick and easy process. Once the hold has been placed, a Library staff member will retrieve your item for you.
After your item has been prepared and checked out to you, you will receive an email, sent to your Muhlenberg email address, explaining three options for receiving your item.
1. Come to the Library with your Muhlenberg ID and pick up the material yourself from the Muhlenberg Room on Level A. Please view the building hours and schedule your arrival accordingly. 
2. Respond to the email with a preferred shipping address if you are currently residing off-campus and would like your material mailed to you
NOTE: We will not be mailing material to those who live locally.
3. Request a scan of selected pages, sections, and/or chapters of the item to be sent to your Muhlenberg email address.
NOTE: In accordance with the Fair Use doctrine, only 20% of a work can be scanned and emailed to you.
You will have 7 days to either pick up your material or respond to the email before it will be checked back in and reshelved. 
If you require any further assistance, please contact Lending Services (circulationdesk@muhlenberg.edu).
Interlibrary Loan
For items Trexler Library does not own, we are still filling all interlibrary loan requests (books and articles) as normal. As some libraries are still not loaning books, it may take more time to receive book requests or we may be unable to receive a book request.
Interlibrary Loan due dates can be found directly on the book strap or in your My Library Account. If you have an Interlibrary loan book coming due, please email illd@muhlenberg.edu to request a renewal or return it using the library Book Drop. If you are not on campus, you can email illd@muhlenberg.edu to request a postage-paid return UPS label.  You can then package the book(s) in a padded envelope or box and drop it off at your local UPS Store.

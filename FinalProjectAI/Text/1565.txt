Pianist Cecile Licad will perform as part of the piano recital series at Muhlenberg College on Friday, March 4, 2005 at 8:00 pm in Paul C. Empie Theatre. Licad’s artistry blends daring musical instincts with the superb training of a “musician’s musician.” She first came to international attention in 1981 as the first musician in a decade to receive the prestigious Leventritt Gold Medal and shortly thereafter appeared in a nationally televised performance of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto in B flat with Sir George Solti and the Chicago Symphony. One of the most sought-after-soloists of her generation, Licad has appeared regularly in recital and with the major orchestras in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, London, Munich, Geneva, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Licad’s summer festival appearances have included Tanglewood, the International Music Festival of Seattle, Mostly Mozart Festival (in both New York and Tokyo) and the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival. Internationally, Licad has played in Europe and Asia, and has collaborated with more than 15 conductors across the globe.

Women's Soccer Wins, Field Hockey Loses at Washington
 Friday, October 7, 2011 - page 2







					 





Gonzalez' assist was the first point of her career.


While birds may fly south for the winter, the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team went south to get back on the winning track.

The Mules (5-5-2, 2-2-1) traveled to Maryland’s Eastern Shore and beat Washington, 2-0, to snap their five-game winless streak and move to 14-0 all-time against the Shorewomen. 

Muhlenberg got on the board in the 44th minute when senior Nicolette Miller was tripped up in the box. She converted the ensuing penalty kick to put the Mules ahead, 1-0. It was the 30th goal of her career; she is just the sixth player in program history to reach that mark.

Then in the 60th minute, junior Jessica Gonzalez found senior Meghan O’Grady on a breakaway, and O’Grady beat the Washington keeper for the final tally. Her second goal of the season pushed her career point total to 61, good for ninth in school history.
 
Senior Michele Toher turned away three shots to record her 18th career shutout. Muhlenberg did not allow a shot during the first half and has not surrendered a goal to Washington (2-8-1, 0-5-1) since 2003.

Field Hockey


The Muhlenberg field hockey team had its three-game winning streak snapped at Washington, 5-1.

Freshman Kayleigh Thies scored the lone Mule goal off an assist from senior Renee Norton in the 67th minute. It’s her eighth goal of the season, which is tied for the most by a Mule freshman since 1991.

Senior  Brittany DeAngelis tied the school record when she registered the 16th defensive save of her career in the 26th minute.

 Kimberly Laurino The Psychology of PropagandaWhen initially given this assignment, my class was asked to analyze a specific form of propaganda. I chose to explore the Nazi propaganda of the Second World War. My research proved that this was not typical propaganda. Instead it was an inescapable force created by two men and driven by psychological forces. The influence of Adolph Hitler on his Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, undoubtedly shaped the propaganda created. The project outlined the methods, reasoning, and reactions of the German people to Hitler, Goebbels, and their mediated messages. The re-examination of this paper seemed appropriate in this time of war. Today's propaganda is indeed different than that of the Nazi Regime, and it is for this reason that I have chosen to present this work.

Student Research and Honors
All Majors and Minors in the History Department participate in two semesters of independent student research in the senior seminar. While the thematic focus of these seminars changes based on the faculty memberâs area of expertise, every Major and Minor undertakes independent research with primary and secondary sources and creates a project in the studentâs geographical and/or thematic areas of interest.
History Majors who are rising Seniors (or Juniors who are completing the research portion of their CUE during their 6th semester) who have earned a 3.75 grade point average in History and a 3.50 grade point average overall have the opportunity to participate in the Departmentâs Honors Program. Students work with three faculty members (at least two from the History Department) to review their work over the course of the semester, which culminates in an oral defense of their independent research project. Students who wish to pursue honors are eligible for one of three honors categories: Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors.

Digital Dopamine

Digital Dopamine is a student choreographed dance concert directed by Gianna Carnevalino and Natalie Gotter that explores the ups and downs of our inherent dependence on technology. It exemplifies a digital place that feels like reality and is designed to draw us in more than the one we were born on. Will reality ever be the same again?

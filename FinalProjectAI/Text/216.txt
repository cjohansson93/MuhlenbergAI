Instructions for Online Studies
 




Informed Consent Template for Online Studies


Unless an exemption is explicitly discussed and approved in your Ethics Proposal, your study must include informed consent. Read the template carefully for instructions, and be sure to fully edit out the instructions on the finished product.




To recruit LOC participants, we recommend you use Qualtrics.


For studies granting LOC credit, you must recruit participants through the SONA system and we recommend you use Qualtrics. To obtain a Qualtrics account, ask your professor to send the name of one member of your research group to timothyclarke@muhlenberg.edu.
If you also want to recruit non-LOC participants, you will need to create a separate copy of your survey with a different distribution link for this purpose. In this copy of your survey, you should not mention LOC credit in the informed consent and debriefing. In fact, if Muhlenberg students might see this version of your survey, you should mention on the first page that the study does NOT grant LOC credit. If Muhlenberg students will see your non-LOC recruitment message (for example, a Facebook post), then it must specify that the study does NOT grant LOC credit.




To recruit LOC participants, you must post your study on SONA.


Setting up your study in SONA isn't difficult, but there are many important details. Read these instructions in full before beginning. Even a small mistake can prevent you from collecting usable data: Link Your Online Study to SONA




Debriefing Template for Online Studies


All participants in all LOC studies must be provided with a debriefing using the online template. Read the template carefully for additional instructions, and be sure to fully edit out the instructions on the finished product.

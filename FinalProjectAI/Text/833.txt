Requirements & Courses
The Media & Communication major provides a systematic scholarly approach to the analysis of media and society. Knowledge of how media and media industries function is essential for responsible citizen participation in a democratic society. Courses in the major provide students with conceptual and analytic tools to assess the social impacts of media as well as to explore media production as a form of creative expression and critical civic engagement. All courses are informed by concerns for the value-related issues and controversies raised by media practices. The major prepares students for graduate study and provides education for careers in digital media, journalism, broadcast media, publishing, advertising, public relations, political advocacy, media law, teaching, film, video, and new media production.

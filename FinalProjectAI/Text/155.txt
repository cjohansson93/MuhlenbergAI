Welcome to the 2022 Innovation Challenge!
Do you have an idea for an innovative new product or service? With just your idea (and a great pitch) you could win $1,000 cash!  
Click here to enter the Innovation Challenge! 
 Idea Briefs (Google Form) must be submitted by March 4th, 2022
 
The 12th Annual Innovation Challenge has officially launched!
The Innovation Challenge is a student pitch competition (think Shark Tank - but for idea-stage ventures) where teams will create a video pitch for their ideas that they will present to a panel of alumni, local business leaders, and investors for a chance to win up to $1000 in prize money (think $Cash$)!
This year's Innovation Challenge will be fully virtual. All teams will submit a video of their pitch for the judges to view and then attend a virtual Q&A with the judges. 
The Innovation Challenge is open to ALL students in ALL majors at ANY level. This competition encourages creative thinkers to develop an innovative idea that satisfies a particular market, social, or environmental need. All ideas are welcome!

Not Much Sleep, But a Sweep for Softball
 Saturday, March 2, 2013 - page 3







					 





Senior Devon Barber stole her 50th career base in the first inning of the Johnson & Wales game. She also swiped a bag as part of a double steal vs. Coe.


The Muhlenberg softball team flew out of Philadelphia yesterday evening, arrived in Florida at 10:00, got settled in around 11:30 and had to wake up to play two games beginning at 9:00 this morning.

The lack of rest didn’t seem to bother them. The Mules opened the season with a pair of wins, shutting out Johnson & Wales, 6-0, before ending the whirlwind 24-hour period with a wild 8-7 walkoff win against 2012 NCAA Tournament invitee Coe.

Senior Angie Sisco pitched her fourth career shutout in the opener. She struck out two and scattered eight hits, getting big outs when she needed them. J&W got the first two runners on in the second, but neither of them advanced.

In the fifth, the Wildcats loaded the bases with nobody out on consecutive singles by the 7, 8 and 9 hitters. Sisco got the top three hitters in the lineup out on a short flyout and two infield popups, starting a stretch of nine straight batters retired to end the game.

As she was throughout 2012, junior Kelly Kline was the big bat in the Muhlenberg lineup, hitting a two-run single to cap a three-run second and doubling in a run in the sixth. Senior Jessica Costa had two hits and scored two runs.

In the nightcap, the Mules came back from an early 2-0 deficit and took the lead in the bottom of the inning after the Kohawks had tied the score in the top in each of the final three innings. Freshman Taylor Trifiolis put an end to the back-and-forth game with a two-out walkoff double in the bottom of the seventh.

Last year, Coe was 36-13, received an at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament and was ranked 20th in the final Division III poll.

Freshman Brittany Dzieciolowski made a big splash in her collegiate debut, going 4-for-4 with four RBI. She hit go-ahead two-run singles in both the third and the sixth, and her hits in the second and fifth contributed to runs.

Muhlenberg was one out away from a 7-6 win when the Kohawks tied the score with a single in the top of the seventh. With one out in the bottom of the inning, Kline singled for her fourth hit of the day. She was forced at second for the second out, but junior Colleen O’Donnell kept the inning alive with a single, and Trifiolis brought home the winning run with a double.

Although she allowed seven runs (five earned) on eight hits, sophomore Kelsey Jones struck out a career-high 12. Like Sisco, she did not walk a batter.

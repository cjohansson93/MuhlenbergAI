Women's Basketball Outlasts F&M to Remain Undefeated
 Thursday, January 12, 2012







					 


 Men’s basketball


Style points don’t count in basketball. Real points do.

So while a 62-54 win at Franklin & Marshall by the ninth-ranked Muhlenberg women’s team – and the basket that put the Mules ahead to stay – may not have been the most artistic, the end result could not have been better.

“At the end of the day, a win’s a win,” said junior Alita Zabrecky, who led all scorers with 22 points.

The game was the closest of the year for Muhlenberg (12-0, 7-0), which was held to its lowest

point total and didn’t grab its first double-digit lead until the final two minutes. In each of the Mules’ first 11 games, they led by at least 15 points at some point in the second half.

“It’s a great experience for us to play in games like this,” said Zabrecky. “Give them a lot of credit – they executed well and

got good shots, and they were tough on the boards.”

The Diplomats (9-5, 6-3), who have lost three of four since starting out 5-0 in Centennial Conference play, led for most of the first half. They 
had their biggest advantage, 20-14, with eight minutes to play, before Muhlenberg went on a 9-0 to take the lead for good. Zabrecky’s banked-in three-pointer from the wing made it 21-20.

“No comment on that one,” she joked.

The Mules tried to pull away in the second half, extending their lead to seven three times, but F&M closed the margin to one, at 44-43, with 11:06 left.

On Muhlenberg’s next possession, senior Alexandra Chili drove the baseline for a reverse layup. Then she grabbed a defensive rebound and led a fastbreak that ended with a layup by Zabrecky.

The next time down, Chili made two free throws to push the spread to seven once again, and the Diplomats never got closer than four the rest of the game.

Chili had an outstanding all-around game, finishing with 14 points, seven rebounds, six assists, two steals and no turnovers.

The Mules are now just one win away from tying the school record for longest winning  streak.

“We just kept executing and kept running our stuff, and that’s what won us the game,” said Zabrecky. “Twelve-and-oh is a great start, but there’s a lot of stuff we still need to work on.”

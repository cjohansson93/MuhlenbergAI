Men's Basketball Drops Second Straight
 Thursday, January 12, 2012 - page 2







					 




With 3:59 to play in the first half of the Muhlenberg men’s basketball game at Franklin & Marshall, a shot clock malfunction forced the scoreboard to be reset.

Unfortunately for the Mules, the score itself was not reset.

Muhlenberg (9-4, 3-4) fell behind the No. 7 Diplomats (14-0, 7-0) early, and while the Mules showed some life at the start of the second half, they could never get within striking distance as they fell, 87-55.

Freshmen Malique Killing and Gabriel Mercer led the Mules with 12 points apiece. It's the fifth time this season that Mercer (left) reached double figures.

Senior Spencer Liddic added 11 points and a team-high seven rebounds, and sophomore Austin Curry chipped in nine points, all on 3-pointers.

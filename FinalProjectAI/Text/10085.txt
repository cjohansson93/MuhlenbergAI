Our English Literatures majors requires students to enroll in 9 ENG courses (or approved cognate), as follows:
At least 1 Reading X course
1 CUE: Senior Seminar in English
At least 3 courses from our Social Justice offerings, at least 1 of which must center on authors who are Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC)
At least 1 course each in the three forms of Poetry, Prose, and Drama/Transmedia.
At least 4 courses (including the CUE)  at 300-level or above
Note that a single course may count towards up to three of these requirements. For example, a 300-level course on Global Black Literature would be at once a Prose course, a social justice (BIPOC) course, and a 300-level course. Similarly, a course such as Reading Caryl Churchill would satisfy the Reading X requirement and count as a Drama/Transmedia course and a Social Justice course (WST, but not BIPOC). Up to 2 Creative Writing courses may be counted towards any of the requirements for the English major.
For additional information on our courses, please see Muhlenberg's course catalog (Search English LIteratures & Writing catalog page)

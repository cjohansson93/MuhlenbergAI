men’s lacrosse loses heartbreaker



The Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team played yet another one-goal game – its seventh in eight games this season – but this time it came out on the wrong end.

The Mules lost a heartbreaker to Franklin & Marshall in triple overtime, 7-6, on a man-up goal. No. 5 Dickinson beat Haverford to move into a tie for second in the Centennial Conference with idle Ursinus, dropping Muhlenberg (4-4, 3-2) into sole possession of fourth place.

Sophomore Corey Aferiat provided the late-game heroics for the Mules, tying the score at 6-all with 




Ardolino’s third-quarter goal was his 10th of the season.



just 6.5 seconds remaining. Muhlenberg turned the ball over with 
1:26 to play and the Diplomats (5-4, 2-2) appeared poised to run the clock out. But senior Matthew Schroeder caused a turnover with 40 seconds left, giving the 
Mules one last chance to send the game to overtime.

After Aferiat did just that, junior Mike Horowitz shut the door repeatedly on F&M in the first overtime. On the first possession he made a save high, then on the 
next made two remarkable stops from point-blank range. The goalie added one more with 15 seconds left in the extra session to keep the Mules alive.

He finished the game with 26 saves in all, a career high.

The Diplomats just missed ending the game in the second overtime when they hit the post, but finally netted the winner 18 seconds into the third while man-up.

The Mule offense opened the game firing on all cylinders. Junior Brent Siebold started the scoring with a man-up goal 2:18 in, and senior Ari Jacobson made it 
2-0 six minutes later.

But F&M would shut out Muhlenberg the rest of the half, and the Diplomats would climb back in despite Horowitz’s remarkable play between the pipes. They finally tied it 
with 1:14 left in the half and nearly took the lead into the break before Horowitz made a huge stop with fewer than 10 seconds left.

F&M took a 4-3 lead heading into the fourth quarter before the Mules tied it with precision passing. Jacobson fed Aferiat to the left of the goal mouth, and Aferiat 
immediately passed across the crease to a wide-open Siebold for an easy finish.

Senior Al Carpetto then gave the Mules the lead 1:50 later, and sophomore Alex Ardolino nearly made it a two-goal game shortly thereafter, but his shot 
deflected off the post.

The Diplomats would score the tying and go-ahead goals just 41 seconds apart, and Horowitz came up with yet another huge save on the ensuing faceoff in a 
one-vs.-one situation to keep it a one-goal game and set the stage for Aferiat’s dramatic tying goal.

Muhlenberg’s last trip to Lancaster also went to triple overtime, with the Mules winning, 9-8.

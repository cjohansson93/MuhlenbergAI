Bittersweet Ending for Antonini, Men's Soccer

Volleyball Sweeps Finale; Field Hockey Ends with Loss

 
The Muhlenberg volleyball team ended its season with a 3-0 sweep of Ursinus.

The Mules, who had no seniors and played the second half of the season with only one junior, finished with a record of 17-11, reaching the 17-win mark for the
first time since 2008.

Freshman Katherine Boll had a match-high 13 kills to end the season with a team-leading 223. Two other freshmen – Vanessa Pulice
(19 assists) and Joanne Josephson (three blocks) – also added to their team-leading totals. Freshmen led Muhlenberg in every statistical category
for the season.

Another team on the rise with young talent, field hockey, closed out its campaign with a 2-1 loss to eight-time defending Centennial Conference champion Ursinus.

The Mules (9-7, 4-6), who had just two seniors in their starting lineup, did not lose a game by more than two goals all season.

Sophomore Kayleigh Thies scored Muhlenberg’s lone goal off a penalty corner 7:57 into the game, erasing an early Ursinus lead. The playoff-bound Bears
(10-7, 6-4) scored early again in the second half, and this time the Mules could not get the equalizer.

Senior Kristen Dornenburg made three saves in the final game of her career. She finished with 488, good for second place on the Mules’s all-time list.
Junior Ashley DeAngelis set a school record with her 13th defensive save of the season.

If there was a chance that the Muhlenberg men’s soccer season was going to end, the team was going to go out in a big way.

Although the Mules knocked off Ursinus, 5-1, they were eliminated from the Centennial Conference playoffs a few hours later 
when Johns Hopkins defeated Washington College 2-0 to push them out of the fifth and final playoff spot.

Senior Cody Antonini scored a hat trick for the Mules (11-5, 5-4). It was the first hat trick of his career – the perfect way to cap off four years of standout soccer for the forward – and the first by a Mule since 2008.

“It’s funny that it happened in what could be my last game,” said Antonini. “I’ve had multiple-goal games before, but never actually got the hat trick until now.”

Antonini (right), who took last year off, wrapped up his career with 112 points, good for fourth place on Muhlenberg’s all-time list. His 49 career goals put him in a tie for fourth in school history.

“Being at Muhlenberg has been a great experience,” stated Antonini. “I love all of my teammates. I really owe a lot to them and especially to my coach because I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him.”

Muhlenberg got on the scoreboard in the 23rd minute with a goal by sophomore Lance Dotzman, the first of his Muhlenberg career. Classmate Bryan Attanasio picked up the assist.

The Mules’ other non-Antonini goal came on a penalty kick by senior Nate Squire as the first half came to a close. It was the first goal of the season for Squire, who led the team with three assists this year. 

 “It’s out of our hands,” added Antonini with regard to Muhlenberg’s then-uncertain playoff situation. “We just had to get the job done tonight and then pray for the best.”

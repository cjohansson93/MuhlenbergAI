Volleyball Finishes 2-2 in Memphis
 Sunday, October 13, 2013







					 





A trip to Memphis would not have been complete without a visit from Elvis, who stopped by to watch the Muhlenberg volleyball team play its final two matches of the Rhodes Fall Break Classic.

By the time Elvis left the building, the Mules had defeated Millsaps in five sets and lost to Rhodes in four to finish 2-2 in Memphis.

The close first match was tied 1-1 in sets and 16-16 in the third set before the scoreboard got all shook up by Muhlenberg’s 9-2 run. But the momentum didn’t carry over to the fourth set, which the Majors won, 25-23, by scoring the last two points.

In the huddle before the decisive fifth set, the Mules (14-7) said “it’s now or never” – or something to that effect. The set was tied four times, but after the last one (11-11), Muhlenberg reeled off the next three points. And when junior Holly Hynson put down a kill at 14-12, it was heartbreak hotel for Millsaps, which also lost to Rhodes in five sets in the first match of the day.



Sophomore Katherine Boll recorded a match-high 18 kills – including three in the fifth set – with only two errors in 28 attempts. She was one of four Muhlenberg players with double figures in kills: sophomore Joanne Josephson hit .500 on 12 kills in 24 attempts, and Hynson and sophomore Sarah Weyhmuller recorded 10 kills apiece. Junior Lindsey Gambocurta (right) added eight.



Josephson said “return to sender” with her six blocks. Sophomore Vanessa Pulice became the first Mule since 2007 to record 20 assists and 20 digs in a match, finishing with 22 and 25, respectively.

Freshman Elizabeth Garrison also was a hound dog on the back row, notching a career-high 18 digs. Junior Chelsea Kaser added 12.

Unfortunately, the King was no good luck charm in the second match. Rhodes led 2-1 after three sets and jumped out to an 18-4 lead in the fourth, putting an end to any Muhlenberg plans for playing another five-set match.

Gambocurta had eight kills and 15 digs (one short of her career high), and Kaser added 16 digs.

The Mules have a full day to explore Memphis on Monday before flying home on Tuesday. For reading this article, thank you, thank you very much.

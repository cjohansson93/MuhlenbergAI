Jessica Beebe Voice
Background
Lauded for having a âhoney-colored toneâ and âthe most radiant solo singingâ from Opera News, Soprano Jessica Beebe is steadily gaining international attention as an affecting interpreter of repertoire spanning over four centuries, ranging from Renaissance music to contemporary American opera. In recent seasons, she has appeared in concert with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (under the baton of Raymond Leppard); the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra; the Princeton Festival Orchestra; the New York City Chamber Orchestra (at Carnegie Hall); Piffaro, the Renaissance Band; the Folger Consort; the Philadelphia Orchestra (under the baton of Yannick NÃ©zet-SÃ©guin), and several other ensembles.
 
Ms. Beebe's vast classical concert repertoire includes Monteverdi's Vespro della beata vergine; Vivaldi's In furore iustissma irÃ¦; Pergolesiâs Stabat Mater; J. S. Bach's Mass in B minor, St. Matthew Passion, St. John Passion, Magnificat, and a wide range of cantatas; Handel's Messiah,  Dixit Dominus, Jepthe, and Judas Maccabaeus; Mozart's Mass in C minor, KrÃ¶nungsmesse, and Requiem; Haydn's Die SchÃ¶pfung, The Seasons, and Harmoniemesse; Brahms' Ein deutsches Requiem; FaurÃ©'s Requiem; Delius' Requiem; and Orff's Carmina Burana. She has also performed late 20th & 21st-century works such as Clearfield's Alleluia; McCullough's Song of the Shulamite; John Rutter's Mass for the Children; and Richard Einhorn's Voices of Light.
 
In the realm of classical opera, Ms. Beebe has performed roles such as Barbarina in Le nozze di Figaro (thus marking her 2015 debut with the Princeton Festival), Zerlina in Don Giovanni, Despina in CosÃ¬ fan tutte; Euridice in Orfeo ed Euridice with Ensemble Oregon, Gretel in Hansel and Gretel, First Niece in Peter Grimes, First Daughter in Akhnaten, La Gloire in Lully's Alceste, and Dido in Dido and Aeneas. Ms. Beebe most recently made her Opera Philadelphia role debut as Luna in David Hertzbergâs The Wake World in 2017.

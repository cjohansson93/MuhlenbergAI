Women’s Lax Falls at Swarthmore


A 9-0 run sent the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team to its fifth straight loss, 16-10 at Swarthmore.

The Mules (5-7, 0-6) led 5-4 midway through the first half, but the Garnet (9-4, 3-3) netted the final six goals of the half and the first three of the second half.

Sophomore Stephanie Umbach led Muhlenberg on offense with five goals and an assist. Senior Molly Davin added two goals and two
assists.

The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team made another push toward a Centennial Conference playoff berth with a 6-3 win at Ursinus.

The Mules (5-8 overall) have won three straight to move into fifth place in the CC with a 5-3 mark and two matches remaining against nationally ranked Johns Hopkins (6-0 CC) and regionally ranked Dickinson (6-1 CC). A win in either match would put Muhlenberg in no worse than a tie for the fifth and final playoff spot.

For the second time this season, the Mules came back to win on the road after dropping two of three doubles matches. Juniors Nina Sanders and Emily Szulman continued their recent strong play at No. 1 doubles, winning 8-1 for their fifth straight victory, but the Bears took the other two doubles matches.

Muhlenberg won handily at the top four singles positions to claim the match. Only one of the sets was closer than 6-2, with Szulman (left) posting a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 2. She has lost a total of only one game in her last three singles matches. 

Sophomore Sharen Resnikoff extended her singles winning streak to five with a 6-4, 6-1 win at No. 4, and classmate Jennifer Goldberg improved her CC record to 7-1 by winning 6-2, 6-1 at No. 3.

Senior Amanda von Taube played the only close singles match, winning the first set 6-4, losing the second in a tiebreaker and taking the third in a supertiebreaker.

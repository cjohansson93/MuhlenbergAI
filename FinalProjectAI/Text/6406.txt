Softball Powers Up in Win vs. Eastern
 Tuesday, April 10, 2012







					 

 Baseball


The Powerball winning numbers for the Muhlenberg softball team in its doubleheader at Eastern were 4, 10, 16, 21 and 40, and the red number was 25.

The Mules flexed their muscles in winning the first game, 8-1, before dropping the nightcap, 7-6.




O'Donnell has three home runs this season, matching her total from last year. She is tied for third in team history with six four-baggers.



4: Muhlenberg (13-13) set a school record with its four home runs in the opener. The previous mark of three was achieved four times, once earlier this season at Swarthmore. Sophomore Colleen O’Donnell hit the jackpot twice, belting a two-run homer in the fifth and a solo shot in the seventh.

O’Donnell’s multiple-home run game was the third by a Mule this season, matching the program’s total from its 33-year history entering the season.

Sophomore Chelsea Benjamin hit her first career home run in the fifth, and sophomore Kelly Kline blasted a three-run shot in the first.

The four home runs provided plenty of offense for reigning Centennial Conference pitcher of the week Kelsey Jones, who extended her personal winning streak to four with a five-hit complete game. She struck out four and was one out away from a shutout before giving up an RBI double.

10: Kline’s home run was her 10th of the season and the 13th of her career, tying the school record. She is only the second player in Centennial Conference history to reach double figures; the league record is 11.

16: Muhlenberg has hit 16 home runs this season, two short of the school record set last year.

21: Although she had her streak of consecutive games with a home run snapped at four, Kline added a two-out three-run double in the third inning of Game 2. It was her 21st extra-base hit of the season, breaking the school record of 20 set by Ashley Brewer last year.

Kline’s bases-clearing hit gave the Mules a 3-1 lead. It was 4-2 before the Eagles (14-11-1) took the lead with three in the bottom of the fifth. Muhlenberg tied it in the sixth on a two-out RBI single by junior Devon Barber, who had three hits in the opener, but Eastern answered with two runs in the bottom of the inning.

Senior Shelby Smith singled in a run in the top of the seventh to cut the deficit in half and advanced to scoring position on freshman Jaimie Klotz’ third hit of the game, but she was stranded there.

40: The two three-RBI games for Kline gave her 40 on the season, the second-highest total in program history. Kline, who entered the week ranked in the top 10 in Division III in slugging percentage (second), home runs per game (third) and RBI per game (ninth), is averaging 1.60 RBI per game.

25: Matching the number on her jersey, Kline has now hit safely in 25 straight games, continuing to distance herself from the previous school record of 18.

Kline isn’t the only Mule on a hitting streak – the whole team is. Over the last 13 games, Muhlenberg is averaging 8.7 runs and hitting at a .348 clip.

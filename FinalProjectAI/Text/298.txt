In promoting inclusive and flipped programming, as well as because we like to share, ITMS now has a repository of our workshop materials content, whether presentation slide decks, worksheets, or supplemental content. 
We are providing this for Muhlenberg faculty and staff, so make sure to log-in as you go to review the content.
Do note that materials are not guaranteed to be provided, as the decision to provide in advance or in the archive is that of the presenter(s), although best effort will be made.
Additionally, we have our recorded session videos in this second repository. You may launch this in a new browser tab by using the square and arrow icon in the far upper right corner of the embedded playlist below. Do note the scroll bar on the right side of the playlist as well as the search in folder for finding items. Alternatively, you may access by launching the Panopto ITMS Training Videos link here for full screen interactivity with our recorded session content.

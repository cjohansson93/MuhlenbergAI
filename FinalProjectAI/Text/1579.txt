 Lures and Snares  will be presented in the Studio Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance of Muhlenberg College from April 1-10, 2005. Performances are Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m; tickets may be purchased by calling 484-664-3333.
The Muhlenberg Theatre Association stage production of Lures and Snares is an original musical adaptation of several stories introduced by American melodramas of the 19 th century. Lures and Snares is about the dreams and values of America – both then and now. Drawing upon Dion Boucicault’s masterpiece The Poor of New York and Augustin Daly’s Under The Gaslight, director Dr. Beth Schachter and co-writer Troy Dwyer have adapted and rewritten these texts in collaboration with composer Mike Krisukas to create the new musical, Lures and Snares.
Why revisit the stage melodrama in this political climate? America was created as “the land of opportunity” and is still often thought of in this way, no matter how wistfully. In traditional melodrama, good always wins and evil always gets its punitive due. Nineteenth-century Americans wanted heroes and heroines, villains and underdogs; they wanted to believe that the poor and righteous would always win out over the rich and corrupt. What happens to these stories when those simple dualities (good and evil) meet more complex contemporary psychological and economic interpretations? Lures and Snares explores this question.
 LURES AND SNARES 
“This is a story about money. And daughters. And money and power. And fathers and fear and finding things out,” characters tell the audience in the opening scene of Lures and Snares. Simultaneously recreating and breaking through the formulaic style of American melodrama, this production reveals new imaginings of romantic love, heroics and villainy. The plot of Lures and Snares whirls around a cast of nearly thirty characters who spring from familiar stage types. The show also offers alternative models to the stereotypes of the villainous “Shylock” and the untrustworthy Irish immigrant “charmer.” Many of the figures on the stage in this musical take actions that are surprisingly far a-field from their traditional fainting fits, simple villainies, or good-hearted altruism. 
There are the Fairweathers, an “old” and established family of New York society with Protestant roots. Then, in a complication on the centuries-old stage tradition of evil usurious Shylock-figures, the Jewish banker Gideon Bloodgood challenges other characters and the audience to understand his experience. He is a Jewish immigrant who risks everything to be an American success - despite the anti-Semitic rebuffs he suffers. And, as a next generation American, his daughter, Rachel, struggles to find her own life and love. In another part of the not-quite-white world of nineteenth century America, the Irish immigrant Badger fights his own socioeconomic battles. And at the center, Laura, the traditional ingénue character, searches for ways to weather hardships of the heart and of the wallet in the cutthroat climate of New York during the financial panics of 1837 and 1857.
These characters each have their specific roles in melodrama, their expected situations and consequences, but Lures and Snares does not simply fulfill a formula. It disrupts this world and explores what happens when the formula explodes. As director Dr. Beth Schachter says, “ What happens when the innocent ingénue discovers that she is NOT, in fact, the truly born daughter of the upper-class father she has idealized - what happens to the story when the fairy-tale mistaken identity turns out to be the truth after all?” Lures and Snares, though an adaptation of a past form, comes from the climate of our own time. As Schachter describes, “I seem to be very invested in teasing out the underpinnings of American myths of progress and fairness - those nostalgic conservative narratives of nuclear (in all senses) families with suburban houses and picket fences - those fairy tales wreak havoc on many Americans.”
“America has moved to the right politically, away from certain possibilities arising from the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, and other cultural-political efforts to create greater access and fairness, and I’m interested in exploring forms [such as melodrama] that carry within their stories our national fantasies of America as a totally fair meritocracy.”
The process of creating Lures and Snares involved a team of performers, artists and scholars. Troy Dwyer, who teaches acting, directs productions, and coaches voice at Muhlenberg, played a key role in the adaptation and rewriting of the melodramas. Dr. Schachter describes his role: “ Troy's genius with plots has enabled us to keep the complex plots flowing as they might in a traditional melodrama while still making space for social critique and more realistic psychological character depth.  His wit and humor sparkle in scene after scene.” Lures and Snares will also have its own original score, composed by Michael Krisukas, an Allentown composer, producer and founding member of the legendary band Zen for Primates.
Schachter applauds Krisukas’ complex melodic compositions for creating "surprising and powerful events through song.” Charles Anderson, artistic director of Philadelphia-based company “dance theatre x” and dance faculty at Muhlenberg College, has provided period-inspired movement work for the actors. Alisa Sickora Kleckner, who teaches costume design and puppetry at Arcadia University, is designing original costumes which creatively mix contemporary and period styles – revealing corsets over t-shirts, for instance. Brian Slocum, Managing Director for the Design Arts program at Lehigh University, is scenic and lighting designer. His design for integrating the architecture of the Studio Theatre with a functioning urban fire-escape offers an evocative and stunning physical world for the project.

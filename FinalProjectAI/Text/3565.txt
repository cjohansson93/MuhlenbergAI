men’s basketball shoots lights outin win at haverford



As Evan Tozer was driving to the basket during pregame warmups, the lights inside Haverfords Gooding Arena went black.

Enough auxiliary lights came on that the two teams continued warming up in relative darkness, but the players on both teams appeared distracted.

But when the game got underway, Muhlenberg was unfazed, delivering 




Junior Justin Greenstone scored all 6 of his points in the last 6:10 of the game.



one of its best shooting nights of the season to down the Fords, 77-69. 

The win moves Muhlenberg into a tie with Haverford for fifth place in the tight Centennial Conference race. The five teams in second through sixth places
are separated by just one game.

It was actually a little scary; I didnt know what was going to happen at first, Tozer said of the blackout. Ive never experienced anything like that.

Tozer was one of three Mules (10-8, 6-5) to score in 
double figures as Muhlenberg shot 53.1 percent from the field.

The Mules rode that hot shooting to take a 15-point lead at the break. They then controlled the tempo throughout much of the second half and stretched the lead to 19 on a Matt OHara 3-pointer with 7:50 to play.

But when the Fords (9-8, 6-5) began to foul to stretch the game, Muhlenberg suddenly chilled at the line. The Mules missed five straight free throws as Haverford cut the lead to nine when Tozer was fouled with 1:16 to play.

While Tozer was walking past the Mule bench to get to 




Curry's was fouled while making a 3-pointer early in the second half. The rare four-point play gave the Mules a 17-point lead.




the line, Muhlenberg coach Scott McClary tried to ease his senior guard.
 
Do you want me to call a timeout to ice you? McClary asked sarcastically.

Tozer looked up, laughed and smiled. Nah, I got this, he replied.

Appearing relieved and calm, Tozer knocked down both 
shots to push the lead back to double digits.

On the very next play, freshman Austin Curry pulled down a defensive rebound and fired a pass to OHara, who appeared to be going for an easy layup 
when a Ford defender closed quickly.

But OHara faked the layup, which drew the defender into the air. With the Haverford player out of the way, OHara delivered an easy pass to junior 
Spencer Liddic, who slammed home a powerful dunk to provide an exclamation point for the win.

Liddic finished with a team-high 23 points and 11 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season. Curry added 17 points, including four 3-pointers, and 
Tozer chipped in 13.

Defensively, freshman center Kevin Hargrove turned away a pair of Ford shots to set a school and CC record for blocks by a freshman with 48.

And for Tozer, the game was huge for many reasons. Not only did the Mules get a huge win in the conference race, but he was able to do it in front of his hometown fans. 

We just played really well as a team. We worked the ball around and were able to get some open looks. And fortunately tonight we were able to knock them down, said Tozer, who grew up a little more than 10 miles from Haverfords campus. I had a lot of my high school coaches, friends and family here tonight, so it felt really great to play well and get a win in front of them. And for the team, this was a really big win for us.

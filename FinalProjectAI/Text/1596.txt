In celebration of the 400 th anniversary of the publication of “Don Quixote,” a marathon reading of the text will take place on Friday, April 22, from 5 p.m.- 3 a.m. The reading, which will be divided into 15-minute reading slots, will begin in the Seegers Student Union of Muhlenberg College. Upon the completion of the Muhlenberg event, the reading will continue at St. John's Lutheran Church from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. Readings will then move to Bethlehem, where from 12 p.m. - 3 p.m. they will take place in Campus Square at the South Bethlehem Neighborhood Center, and 6 p.m. until the end of the book at the Touchstone Theatre in Bethlehem.
Every year April 23 rd is celebrated as the International Day of “Don Quixote.” This day was selected to commemorate the date on which two of the world's greatest writers --Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra and William Shakespeare-- died in 1616. Many Hispanic and Spanish towns celebrate this day by hosting public readings of the book. This year, the day is especially meaningful as it marks the 400th anniversary of the first half of Don Quijote de la Mancha.
Throughout the year, Muhlenberg College and Touchstone Theatre have partnered to celebrate the classic novel’s anniversary through community readings of the text. These groups, held throughout the Lehigh Valley, are open to everyone from long-time fans, to those new to Miguel Cervantes’ most famous work.

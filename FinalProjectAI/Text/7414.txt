It may not be his home course, but Christopher Lucarelli certainly feels right at home at the Blue Ridge Country Club. 

The senior on the Muhlenberg men’s golf team tied for second in a field of 77 golfers to help the Mules finish sixth at the Messiah Falcon Classic, the final tuneup before the Centennial Conference Championships. Lucarelli (left) earned medalist honors with a career-best 71 on the same course in the fall.

Lucarelli carded a pair of birdies and shot an even-par 36 on the back nine to tie with six other golfers at four over par, three strokes back of the individual champion. The Mules finished just six shots behind CC foe Franklin & Marshall, which came in fourth among 15 teams.

Freshman John Froberg signed for an 84, sophomore Jonathan Graulich an 86 and senior Chris DiMaio an 87 for Muhlenberg.

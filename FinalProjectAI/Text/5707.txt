The Muhlenberg football team climbed to eighth place in the final D3football.com poll of the 2007 season.




Celebrations, like this one between Dan Aitkens and Brandon Doyle, were common for the Mules in 2007.




The ranking is, by far, the best for the Mules in an end-of-season poll. They were 17th in the final American Football Coaches Association poll of 2002. 
The D3football.com poll began the following year, and Muhlenberg received votes in the final poll in both 2003 and 2004. Only one other Centennial Conference
team in the five-year history of the poll finished in the top 25 — Johns Hopkins at No. 25 in 2003.

The Mules went undefeated in the regular season and entered the NCAA playoffs ranked 13th. They defeated then-No. 10 Salisbury, 31-21, in the first round, before losing
at Wesley, 38-21, in the round of 16. Wesley, which finished fifth in the poll, lost in the next round to No. 3 Mary Hardin-Baylor, whose only two losses were to 
Division III national champion Wis.-Whitewater.

In the final poll (at right), Muhlenberg was ranked ahead of one team that advanced further in the playoffs, Wabash.

The rankings confirm that Muhlenberg was one of the biggest surprises in Division III football in 2007. The other nine teams in the final top 10 were all ranked in the
preseason top 25, with seven of them in the top 10. The Mules, coming off a 5-5 campaign, did not receive any preseason recognition in the poll.

During the regular season, the Mules were consistently ranked higher in the AFCA poll, but not so at the end. Muhlenberg finished 10th in the 

final AFCA rankings, the
second-best final ranking for a CC school since the AFCA national poll was inaugurated in 1999. Western Maryland was ninth in the final 1999 poll.

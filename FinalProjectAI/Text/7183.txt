Three Mules Teams Drop Openers

Field Hockey, Women’s Soccer Fall on Road


The Muhlenberg field hockey team looked to be headed for a repeat of last year’s season opener against Scranton when it was tied 1-1 late in regulation. 
A year ago, the Mules scored in the first minute of overtime for a 2-1 win, but this time it was the Lady Royals who had the late magic, converting a penalty
stroke with 2:37 left for the game-winning goal.

The Mules opened the scoring when junior Kayleigh Thies scored on a blast off a penalty corner less than 10 minutes into the second half. Scranton
tied the game less than three minutes later, however.

Junior Sierra Lenker made a career-high seven saves, but it was her teammates who saved her when she received a green card midway through the
second half. Muhlenberg allowed one shot (which went wide) while playing without a goalie and killed off the rest of the time.

A flurry of second-half goals broke open a close game as the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team fell to Brockport State, 3-0, in the first round
of the Lady Colonel Classic at Wilkes. The Golden Eagles, coming off a 15-3-2 season, scored all three of their goals in a span of nine minutes. Sophomore
Jen Mermelstein, playing in her first career game, made seven saves.

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team gave nationally ranked Rutgers-Camden all it could handle in the season and home opener, but dropped a hard-fought, 2-1 decision.

The Scarlet Raptors, ranked No. 14 in the NSCAA preseason poll, took a 1-0 lead into halftime before the Mules’ Travis Wantchekon came back with a dramatic equalizer. 

With just over 33 minutes to play, the junior defensive midfielder scored his second career goal on a long rocket. Wantchekon (left) took a touch well outside the 18-yard box and fired a right-footed shot on goal, the ball deflecting off a Rutgers-Camden defender and over the outstretched arms of the Scarlet Raptors’ goalie to tie the game at 1.

Rutgers-Camden took the lead for good less than two minutes later, though, and the Mules never recovered. Muhlenberg, playing in new uniforms on a field with new banners on the bleachers, a new scoreboard and a new press box, did its best to put pressure on the Scarlet Raptors for much of the second half, but was unable to find another equalizer.

Junior Oliver Katz made a crucial stop with about 20 minutes to play to keep the Mules in the game. Katz sprinted back on a breakaway to deflect the ball away from a Rutgers-Camden attacker who had a look at an empty net, preventing the Scarlet Raptors from taking a two-goal lead.

Senior forward Jeff Reinhart nearly equalized for the Mules with eight minutes remaining, but his on-target blast was deflected just over the bar.

Baseball Falls in Last Game of Trip

Despite getting a solid starting pitching performance for the fifth straight day, the Muhlenberg baseball team lost the finale of its Spring Break trip
to South Carolina, 4-2 to undefeated Johnson & Wales.

Junior Christian Ferlan allowed only six hits and struck out three in a seven-inning stint. After giving up three runs in the bottom of the
first, he blanked the Wildcats for the rest of his outing, retiring hitters with a runner on third in the third, fifth and seventh.

In the last five games, Mule starters have given up just six earned runs in 36 1/3 innings.

Muhlenberg (5-5) got a run back in the top of the third on a double by junior Jimmy Cody and cut the gap to one on an RBI pinch-single
by sophomore Andrew Rava in the seventh. The Mules went down 1-2-3 in the eighth and ninth, however, and Johnson & Wales added an
unearned insurance run in the bottom of the eighth.

Junior Kurt Johnson had two of the Mules’ four hits and scored a run. Junior Vince Nardone (right), making his first start
of the season in right field, recorded two outfield assists, picking off one runner who rounded second too much after a hit and doubling off another after
catching a live drive.

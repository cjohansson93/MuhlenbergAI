Volleyball Bounces Back; Field Hockey Hangs Tough


The Muhlenberg volleyball team had a Capital day, stepping away from its Centennial Conference playoff pursuit to defeat
two teams from the Capital Athletic Conference.

The Mules (22-3) beat Marymount in three sets and host York in four, bouncing back nicely from Thursday’s loss to
Haverford that snapped a 13-match winning streak.

Muhlenberg was particularly impressive against a Marymount team that came in with a record of 23-5. Only the second set (25-23)
was close, and the Mules wrapped the match up with a 25-5 win in the third set.

Junior Katherine Boll had a match-high nine kills, and junior Joanne Josephson added
seven kills in only 11 attempts. Both also recorded four blocks for a defense that held the Saints to a negative hitting percentage.

Sophomores Elizabeth Garrison and Allison Glass had long service runs in the fourth set,
each finishing with four aces. (corrected 10/20)

Muhlenberg won the first two sets against York before the teams split a pair of two-point sets. Boll and Josephson again led
the attack with 11 kills apiece, and junior Sarah Weyhmuller added 10.

Senior Nikki Dickson notched a double-double with 25 assists and 10 digs. She also served three aces to move
within six of the school record of 69 in a season.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team hung tough with sixth-ranked Franklin & Marshall but had its five-game winning streak snapped
with a 2-1 loss.

The Mules (9-3, 5-2) overcame an early 1-0 deficit when sophomore Rachel Strow tipped in a rebound
off a penalty corner late in the first half for her first goal of the season.

Senior Sierra Lenker kept the score tied by saving a penalty stroke five minutes later, but the
Diplomats (13-1, 6-1) controlled play in the second half, holding Muhlenberg without a shot and putting in the winning goal with
16:15 left.

The loss dropped the Mules into a virtual third-place tie in the CC with three league games remaining.

The Muhlenberg cross country teams had a successful day at the Gettysburg Invitational, their final tuneup for the Centennial Conference Championships.

The women, running at full strength for the first time all season, finished fourth out of 35 teams and the men sixth out of 34. Division I Bucknell won the team titles for both women and men.

Junior Melanie Tramontina led the women across the finish line, coming in 18th in a field of almost 400 runners. 
Junior Claire Thornton was 44th with a time that was 21 seconds better than what she ran in the same meet last year.

Freshmen Alex Tendler (46th), Mallory Snyder (52nd) and Emily Davidson (55th) followed close behind.

The Mules were just one point behind Susquehanna, ranked eighth in the Mideast Region, and two points ahead of host
Gettysburg, a team it finished behind at last year’s regional meet. They also finished ahead of two teams ranked
in the South/Southeast Region (Eastern Mennonite and Washington and Lee).

Sophomore Jaryd Flank (right) was the top Muhlenberg finisher, coming in 12th in the men’s race.
His time was a 34-second improvement from last year’s Gettysburg Invitational.

Senior Luke Munyan placed 25th, and classmate Josh Elkan was 49th.

Two of the four Division III teams that finished ahead of the Mule men are regionally ranked. Eastern Mennonite, which came
in two spots behind Muhlenberg, is ranked fifth in the South/Southeast Region.

Women's Basketball Returns to Beat McDaniel
 Saturday, January 5, 2013 - page 2







					 





Junior Colleen Caldwell recorded five assists and committed only one turnover. She also pulled down a career-high six rebounds.



The word around Memorial Hall following a 66-48 win over McDaniel was that it was the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team’s most impressive postbreak performance in a while. And it wasn’t just the fans saying it.

“This was one of the best games we’ve played after break in a long time and we knew that even at halftime,” said junior Erin Laney, who led the team with seven rebounds, including five on the offensive end

Although they only led by seven, 25-18, at the half, the Mules (8-3, 5-1) scored 41 points in the second half to get the win.

Leading the Mules was senior Alita Zabrecky, who finished with 23 points, 15 of them in the second half. She also added six rebounds, four assists and three steals.

Zabrecky came out of the halftime break on fire, scoring eight points in the first four minutes to help extend the Mules’ lead to 14. But she wasn’t just scoring. She had a steal, a block and another steal on consecutive McDaniel possessions in the opening minutes of the second half. Following two of her three steals, she found the open player down the court and assisted on layups. 

“Alita is the rock on this team,” said Laney, who finished with 10 points on 5-for-8 shooting from the field. “When she gets fired up, we all get fired up and that’s definitely what happened in the second half.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen her get as many ‘and-ones’ as she did today,” she laughed.

Zabrecky finished a perfect 9-for-9 from the line, three of those free throws capping off three-point plays. As a team, the Mules drained 16 of 17 free throws.

Although McDaniel cut the Mules’ lead to four with 12:08 remaining, that was the closest the Green Terror would get. After converting on their next four possessions, including a three-point play by Zabrecky, the Mules closed the game on a 13-2 run.

Junior Leeann Lanza added 10 points and six rebounds. Muhlenberg held a 48-33 advantage over McDaniel (5-5, 2-4) on the boards.

The Mules had 13 turnovers, just three in the second half, against a Green Terror squad that forces an average of 30.8 turnovers per game.

“The 13 turnovers show that our guards did a great job,” added Laney. “We knew that they were a good perimeter team and we would have to defend the outside shot, but the guards also stepped up and took care of the ball on offense.”

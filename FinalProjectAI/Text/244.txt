Life at Muhlenberg is more than all work and no play. The College has over 110 student clubs and organizations recognized by Student Government and even more groups that operate on an informal basis. And if you donât see a club or organization you want, feel free to start one.
From community engagement to athletics, from the arts to academic honor societies, thereâs no limit to the ways you can get involved at Muhlenberg. Come and see what goes on behind our red doors!

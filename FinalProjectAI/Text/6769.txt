Women's Basketball Suffers Rare Home Loss
 Thursday, November 29, 2012 - page 2







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team could not recover from an early hole and suffered its first Centennial Conference loss of the season, 66-56 to Swarthmore.

The Garnet (4-0, 2-0) scored the first 13 points of the game and never looked back in winning for only the second time in 29 trips to Memorial Hall.

Trailing by 19 at halftime, the Mules (2-2, 1-1) opened the second half on a 12-2 run to cut the deficit to nine. But Swarthmore responded by scoring the next five 
points and maintained a double-digit lead until the final two minutes of the game.

Muhlenberg allowed only four second-half field goals but struggled with its own shooting throughout the game, hitting on just 31.7 percent of its field goal tries and 
making only five of 24 three-point attempts.

Senior Alita Zabrecky led the Mules with 13 points, and junior Erin Laney added 10. Sophomore Hannah Rush recorded
a career-high seven assists.

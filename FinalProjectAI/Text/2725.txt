Muhlenberg bounced back from a 9-1 loss in the first game to defeat Centennial Conference regular-season champion Ursinus, 8-5, and gain a split of its second-to-last doubleheader of the season.

The Mules (7-27, 3-13) scored all eight of their runs in the second inning. Junior RiRi Ferrigno led off the frame with a single and capped it with her second career grand slam. 

In between, freshman Alyssa Epstein delivered a two-out RBI single, and three more runs scored on errors. Freshman Jess Kasza also had two hits in the inning, a single and a double, then helped preserve the win by starting a 6-3 double play with nobody out and the tying run on deck in the bottom of the seventh.

Freshman Ashley Brewer pitched a six-hitter to earn her first career win.

Track & Field



The Muhlenberg track and field teams warmed up for next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships with a non-scoring meet at Lehigh University. 

Freshman Abby Simons qualified for the ECAC Championships in the 800m, improving her personal best by almost three seconds to finish fourth in 2:20.74. Sophomore Lauren Conicella also set a personal record in the same event, crossing the finish line seventh in 2:22.35.

The 4x100m relay team improved its ECAC-qualifying time to 51.91, taking fourth spot. Sophomore Debra Crockett also met the qualifying mark for ECACs with a personal-best toss of 117-4 in the discus.

For the men, junior Timothy Van Syckle was victorious in the 5000m run with a time of 15:19.84.

championship.

The Mules shot a 305 in the second of three rounds at the CC tourney to maintain the lead they established the first day. The margin shrank from seven strokes to four, however, as second-place McDaniel came into the clubhouse with a 302, setting the stage for an exciting final round.

Closer to home, the Muhlenberg women’s golf team, hosting the CC Championships for the first time, was fourth out of five teams after the first of two rounds. Senior Dana Lynn Bielecki shot a career-best 85, four strokes off the lead.

For the men, junior Bill Snow moved into sole possession of first place after sharing it through 18 holes. His two-day total of 150 is two strokes better than the nearest competitors.

For the second day in a row, the Mules had four players shoot in the 70s. This time, senior Garrett Carpenter, who posted Muhlenberg’s worst score in the first round, led the way, tying for the low round in the tournament by improving his score by 11 strokes to 73.

Sophomore Biff Slocum (78-77) and freshman Zachary Oyer (78-78) stayed consistent from the first round to the second.

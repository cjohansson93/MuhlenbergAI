madeira retires after 22 years


The winningest coach in Muhlenberg College athletic history, Dave Madeira has announced his retirement.

Madeira compiled a career record of 311-247 in 22 seasons as head men’s basketball coach. 

He surpassed current athletic director and former baseball coach Sam Beidleman on the school’s all-time list with his 256th win on Jan. 15, 2005, at McDaniel. Madeira’s 300th win came against Hood on Jan. 3, 2009, and his final win was a 52-50 victory against Haverford in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs on Feb. 25 – part of a 16-11 season for the Mules.

“God has blessed my wife and I with 22 years of employment as the head coach of basketball at Muhlenberg College. I’ve worked with tremendous support from our administration, faculty, assistant coaches and of course the players,” said Madeira.
 
“We are moving on to another phase of our lives where we will move closer to our son, daughter-in-law and five grandchildren. We are very thankful to have had this opportunity at Muhlenberg and will be MULES the rest of our lives.”
 
Under Madeira’s coaching, Muhlenberg won two Centennial Conference championships and won or shared CC East Division titles in eight of the 10 years in which the CC had divisions. The Mules received bids to the NCAA Division III Tournament in both 1995 and 1998.

Madeira led the Mules to double digits in wins in each of his first 16 seasons. His team qualified for conference playoffs 13 times and conference playoff tiebreakers on two other occasions.

Including his five years as an assistant coach before becoming head coach, Madeira was on the bench for 402 Muhlenberg wins.

Before coming to Muhlenberg, the 62-year-old Madeira piloted the highly successful basketball program at Lakeland High School, Lackawanna County, from 1974 to 1981, where he earned a District II PIAA championship in 1977. Madeira was an assistant for four years at Abington High School, Montgomery County, and for one year at Melbourne (Fla.) High School.

Madeira is a 1969 graduate of Concord College in Athens, W.Va., where he played varsity football and baseball. He earned his master’s degree in physical education from West Chester University.

“Dave has had a long and distinguished career at Muhlenberg,” said Beidleman. “His impact on the hundreds of young men he coached goes far beyond the basketball court. I’m sure I speak for the entire College community in wishing him a long and healthy retirement.”

Muhlenberg will conduct an immediate search for a replacement.

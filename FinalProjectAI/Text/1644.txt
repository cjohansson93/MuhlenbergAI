âBerg Center For Ethics Holds Forum To Discuss Hurricane Katrina 



On Thursday, October 6, The Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics will host a forum titled Hurricane Katrina: What Can We Learn? from 3:30 â 5:30 p.m. in Moyer Hall, Miller Forum. 


	 Tuesday, October 4, 2005  01:59 PM

The forum is open to students, College faculty and staff and the community-at-large. 
Some of the questions that will be raised and discussed are:  •What are the social justice issues raised by the poor response to the disaster?  •What part did and should the media play in this tragedy? What can be learned from this event?  •What are ethical considerations for those who were displaced and for those communities receiving the displaced?  •Can this tragic event also be a moment of opportunity for opening a new public dialogue on race and class?  •What are our ethical considerations, as an academic institution, when we use events like this as a place or moment for teaching, learning, conversing?
All are welcome to attend and participation is encouraged. A microphone will be available for attendees to use to share ideas, ask questions and respond to others.
The College’s Center for Ethics is in the midst of its year long series, The Ethics and Politics of Identity, which addresses the ethical challenges that surround the changing categories of social, national, and global identities. For more information on the series, or to view the schedule of events for the fall semester, please visit:

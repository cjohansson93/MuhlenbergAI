field hockey flies with hawks





Junior Kristin Garbutt made her team-leading third defensive save of the season in the second half.



The Muhlenberg field hockey team threw a scare into undefeated, 13th-ranked Montclair State, but was shut out for the first time this season and lost, 1-0.

The Mules (5-3) outshot the Red Hawks (8-0), 13-12, and had several good chances to score. Less than 10 minutes into the game, Muhlenberg had three consecutive shots 
saved in a flurry around the goal.

Early in the second half, a Montclair defender made a defensive save to keep the game scoreless. The Red Hawks netted the lone goal moments later.

Muhlenberg’s best chance to tie the game came with less than eight minutes remaining. A lofted shot off a penalty corner hit the crossbar, and a shot off the rebound
was cleared off the line by a back.

All three of the Mules’s losses are by one goal, two to teams ranked in the top 15 at the time of the game.

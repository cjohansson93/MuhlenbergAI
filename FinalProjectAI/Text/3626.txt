pair of football playersselected to all-region team



Two members of the Muhlenberg football team’s defense, senior linebacker Patrick McDonough and junior defensive end Kenneth
Cobb, were named to the All-South Region team by D3football.com.

McDonough (left) was a first-team selection. The Centennial Conference defensive player of the year, he led the Mules with 105 tackles in 10 games to become the


first Muhlenberg player to average more than 10 tackles per game since 1997. McDonough recorded 5½ tackles for loss, including 3 sacks, and forced a fumble.
He led the CC in total tackles and is tied for 30th in Division III in tackles heading into the national semifinals.

A second-team pick, Cobb (right) enjoyed a breakout season for the Mules, setting a school record with 11 sacks and leading the team with 16½ tackles
for loss. He finished with 52 total tackles and added 7 pass breakups, 3 forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. Cobb tied for the CC lead and is tied for 14th in
Division III in sacks.

Muhlenberg finished the season with a record of 7-4 and shared its ninth CC championship, earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament. The defense on which 
McDonough and Cobb excelled allowed fewer than 300 yards and 20 points per game for the 10th year in a row.

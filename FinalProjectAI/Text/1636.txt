	 Friday, September 9, 2005  01:59 PM

A discussion moderated by Lora Taub, assistant professor of communication, will follow. This event is free and open to the public.
“Banana Split,” by Kip Fulbeck, interweaves narratives, stories and media clips to explore biracial ethnicity and Asian self-identity. The filmmaker examines his parents’ relationship (his father is Caucasian and his mother is Asian) and also explores ethnic dating patterns and media stereotypes of Asian American men. He combines improvisation, stand-up comedy, political activism and personal stories to questions where Hapas (people of mixed race with Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry) belong in a country that ignores multiracialism. 
 The Ethics and Politics of Identity is a year long series of programs, sponsored by the Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics , about the ethical challenges that surround the changing categories of social, national, and global identities.

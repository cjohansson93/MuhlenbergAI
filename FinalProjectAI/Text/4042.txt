women's lacrosse gets pumped up and dispatches McDaniel





For the fourth time this season, freshman Kaitlyn McCaffrey caused at least four turnovers.



Before every Muhlenberg women's lacrosse game, a different group of players is assigned to pump up the squad during the week.

Sometimes it's with music, other times the players are given ribbons to wear in their hair as a show of unity.

But before Muhlenbergs game against McDaniel, the Mule seniors took a different approach, using an impassioned speech to get their teammates amped up. 

The Mules responded by scoring five of the first seven goals and snapping their six-game losing streak with a 17-6 win over the Green Terror.

 "We pretty much told them that this is our final season and we don't want it to end on a bad note," senior Danielle Rosen said. "We told them we were going to come out from the opening draw and do everything we could to stop the losing streak.

"We played like a much more focused team from the start, and I'm so proud of the way the girls played as a true team today."

While it was the seniors who shared the inspiring words, it was junior Angela Napoletano who went right to work ensuring the skid would end.

Napoletano scored on a free-position shot 21 seconds into the game to put the Mules on the board.

The Green Terror tied it 40 seconds later, but the Mules responded by scoring seven of the next nine goals, including two each from Rosen and sophomore Alexandra Gabriele, to lead, 8-3, at the break.




Gabriele finished with a career-high four points, including her first hat trick as a Mule.




As if the five-goal halftime lead wasn't enough, Muhlenberg's offense continued to attack, and quick fashion, to start the second frame.

Senior Maggie Sullivan and Rosen scored 34 seconds apart, and the Mules added three more unanswered goals in the next nine minutes to open up a 10-goal lead and essentially put the game away.

Rosen scored at least five goals in a game for the third time this season and added two assists to pull to within two points of third place on Muhlenberg's all-time list.

Napoletano added four goals and two assists, while sophomore Alex Bellini collected the second hat trick of her career.

While Muhlenberg's offense lit up the scoreboard, the defense did its part by limiting the Green Terror to just three goals in each half. 

It was the first time the Mules held a team to less than 10 goals since the end of their four-game winning streak to open the season. And according to senior goalie Allisyn Vachon, the defense could be the key to the Mules putting together a run to close out the season.

"We've been really close the last couple games, but today everybody was on the same page," she said. "We have so many players that can score on offense that we as a defense need to keep on shutting teams down. We have the talent, and today we put it all together with a great team effort."

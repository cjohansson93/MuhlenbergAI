BREWER OPENS SEASON WITH NO-HITTER 


The Muhlenberg softball team brewed up something truly special in its first game of the season.

Junior Ashley Brewer tossed a no-hitter and drove in the game-winning run in the Mules 1-0 victory over Rensselaer. Brewers no-hitter is the eighth in school history and the first to come in the season opener.




Muhlenberg had gone more than 18 years without a no-no until last year, when current junior Alyssa Bruckner pitched one against Dickinson. The Mules now have two in their last 15 regular-season games.

And this one came against a team that was 21st in Division III in scoring last season and 36th in batting average.

I just mixed up my pitches a lot and tried to keep them off balance, said Brewer (left). I was lucky enough to have all my pitches working today. 

Brewers pitches werent quite working against the Engineers first batter, however, as she plunked her. But she worked out of the inning and did so again when she allowed the leadoff hitters to reach base in the third and fourth innings as well, the first by hit-by-pitch and the second via a walk.

Muhlenberg could not muster any offense for Brewer in the early going, as it went down in order in the first three innings. But then fortune intervened. Freshman Devon Barber led off the fourth by reaching first after a dropped third strike, and classmate Jessica Costa sacrificed her over to second, setting the stage for the pitcher to give herself all the help she needed.

Brewer did just that, belting a double into the left-centerfield gap and plating Barber.

I was just trying to work the at-bat, and I knew I had to put it in play, she said. It was pretty much right down the middle. I trusted myself and just swung at it, and it turned out great.

The Mules threatened again in top of the seventh. Senior Jenna Van Waalwijk hit a one-out single, stole second and advanced to third on an error.

Her teammates couldnt drive her in, but it didnt matter. In the final half-inning Brewer twice in a row induced grounders to herself, then struck out the final batter looking. She struck out seven total in the no-hitter, two off her career high.

Honestly, I was just trying to spot my pitches and have a good game, she commented. It worked out pretty well.

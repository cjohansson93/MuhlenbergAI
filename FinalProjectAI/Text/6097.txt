Women's DMR Highlights Solid Track Showing at Armory

The women's distance medley relay team is the first in school history to break the 12-minute mark. (From L to R: Cronin hands off to Kuchera, Bash and Mayden) 



Some of Muhlenberg’s top runners saved their best for last at the New York City Armory.

Looking to post qualifying times for the Division III Indoor Championships, the Mules entered four events at the Columbia Last Chance Qualifier and came away with two school records, one personal best and a season best.

The women’s distance medley relay got the weekend off to a fast start by shattering the school record on Friday night.

The team of sophomore Nicki Cronin, freshman Kirsten Kuchera and juniors Erica Bash and Samantha Mayden shaved more than 11 seconds off the Mule mark with a time of 11:57.95. That time ranked in the top 20 in Division III in results reported as of Saturday morning.

Sophomore Stephanie Carnevale followed that up with her own record-breaking performance on Saturday. She finished the 60-meter hurdles in a time of 9.30, besting her own mark by .01 seconds.

Senior Peter Rice finished third in the 400 in a season-best time of 48.85, which converts to 49.35 for the banked track, and Mayden knocked more than a second off her personal best time in mile, finishing in 5:00.38.

The qualifiers for the national chamionships will be announced on Monday.

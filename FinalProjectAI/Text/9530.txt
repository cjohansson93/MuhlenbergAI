Into the Woods
Oct. 25 - Nov. 3, 2019
Music and lyrics by Stephen SondheimBook by James LapineDirected by Beth SchachterMusical Director: Ed BaraChoreographer: Samuel Antonio Reyes
Sondheim and Lapine bring your favorite fairytale characters together for a timeless, relevant, darkly comic modern classic. The story starts with a wish: the baker and his wife wish for a child; Cinderella wishes to attend the Kingâs Festival; Jack wishes his cow would give milk. When the baker and his wife learn that a witchâs spell is to blame for their troubles, they set off on a journey to break the curse. All the characters get their wish â for a time. But as they soon learn, a wish granted is no guarantee of happinessâ¦
One of Sondheimâs most beloved musicals, Into the Woods boasts a Tony Award-winning score and book that are both complex and enchanting. âFollow the music. It will take you somewhere wonderful.â âNY Times

Volleyball, Field Hockey Fall at Home
 Tuesday, September 20, 2011 - page 2







					 





Freshman Holly Hynson record 4 kills and assisted on a pair of blocks.


The Muhlenberg volleyball team scrapped and clawed and had plenty to feel good about despite getting swept by Moravian.

The result tied the Matte Award standings for the 2011-12 year at 1-1. The Greyhounds (9-4) were making 

their second trip to Muhlenberg this season; in their first, they won the Buttermaker Tournament.

Even in the first set, a 25-11 loss, the Mules (3-9) did not make things easy for their Lehigh Valley rivals. Muhlenberg recorded 30 of its season-high 81 digs in the first set, with sophomore Morgan Duggan leading the way with 10.

The Mules had leads of 9-3 and 15-10 in the second set before Moravian came back to tie and eventually win, 25-22.

In the third set, it was Muhlenberg that did the rallying, coming back from an early 5-1 hole. Down to their final point at 24-22, the Mules came back to tie the score and then fought off three more match points before the Greyhounds finally won, 29-27.

Duggan finished with a career-high 23 digs to go along with 14 assists. Freshman Alyssa Schell also set a career high in digs, with 19. Senior Brooke McQueen narrowly missed a double-double with a team-high 10 kills and 9 digs.

Field Hockey



Despite jumping out to an early lead, the Muhlenberg field hockey team fell to Haverford, 5-1.

Freshman Kayleigh Thies scored the second goal of her career when she drove home a 




Freshman Heather Porrini made a diving defensive save in the final minute.



pass from senior Renee Norton into the right side of the cage to put the Mules up 
1-0 eight minutes into the game.

But that goal appeared to awaken the Fords, whose only loss this season is by one goal to No. 7 Rowan. They responded less than four minutes later and added another goal before the break before taking control in the second half.

Senior Brittany DeAngelis made a pair of defensive saves in the first half to move into a tie for second on the school’s all-time list with 15. She needs just one more to tie the career mark.
Junior Kristen Dornenburg made a season-high 14 saves in goal.

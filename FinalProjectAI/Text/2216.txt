Jordan Ahnquist  Class of 2005 Major in Theatre
Actor





 
I learned on graduation day that I was accepted into Milwaukee Repertory Theatre’s internship program, and one month later I was on a plane bound for the Midwest. Working as an intern gave me an opportunity to test drive my Muhlenberg-fashioned acting skills in small roles and understudy assignments and to see how those skills translated to the professional theater world.
As it turned out, they translated extremely well. Milwaukee Rep staged Molière’s Tartuffe the year after my internship, and I was invited back to recreate a role I played in Francine Roussel’s production during my senior year at the ‘Berg. Working with Milwaukee Rep opened doors and led to acting jobs with some great companies, including Montana Shakespeare in the Parks, The Utah Shakespeare Festival, The Skylight, and First Stage Children’s Theater. Recently, I moved to Boston and have been fortunate to work consistently with Shear Madness, a long running comedy in Boston’s theatre district, as well as with The Lyric Stage Company, SpeakEasy Stage Company, New Repertory Theatre, and Boston Playwrights' Theatre.
Muhlenberg provided me with a great foundation from which to grow in the professional theatre world. The liberal arts structure at Muhlenberg challenged me to be a flexible and thoughtful artist, which fostered the required ability to adapt in this ever-changing career. In addition to earning a living through stage and film work, I have also led workshops, hosted talkbacks, directed productions, and helped create a pilot education program.  Muhlenberg’s training has allowed me to reach the goals I had as a freshman and continues to prove invaluable as new aspirations emerge.

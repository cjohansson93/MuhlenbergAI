The Muhlenberg track and field teams closed out the regular season with a solid showing at the Lehigh Games.


Three Mules turned in ECAC-qualifying performances: Seniors Nicki Cronin in the 800 meters and Stephanie Carnevale in the 100-meter hurdles and junior Tyler Bauer, who represented Muhlenberg in the javelin at the Penn Relays.

Ahead of next weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships, the Mules turned in 25 new or improved conference qualifying marks to go along with nine marks that landed on the program’s all-time performance list.

Three of those top-10 performances were from the shot put group. Freshman Michelle Gaykowski jumped into third with a throw of 36-4Â¼, the best mark in six years. Sophomore Jessica Thimmel and junior Cora Wallace moved into eighth and 10th, respectively. Gaykowski also cracked the all-time list in the javelin, checking in at ninth.

Sophomore Ashley Riley landed on the performance list in both the long jump (ninth) and triple jump (fifth), and classmate Katrina Faust did so in the 100-meter hurdles (sixth). 

Junior Vanessa Chambers (right) moved into 10th on the performance list in the 200 meters, while Cronin’s mark in the 800 was good for seventh in program history.

Carnevale posted the best finish of the day, placing second in the 100-meter hurdles. Gaykowski was third in the shot put, while Thimmel took fourth in the discus. Junior Cody Geyer finished fourth in the 100 meters and eighth in the 200, while freshman Jack Zurlini placed seventh in the javelin with a new personal best.

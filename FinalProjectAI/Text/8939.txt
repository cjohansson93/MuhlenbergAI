PSI CHI National Honor Society, Muhlenberg College

Psi Chi is the National Honor Society in Psychology. Membership in Psi Chi denotes overall academic excellence, a dedication to psychological study, and high standards of personal behavior.
Psychology majors or minors who meet the requirements for membership are tapped for induction in the fall and spring of each academic year.
Eligibility requirements include: overall GPA of 3.5, psychology GPA of 3.5*, declared Psychology major, top 35% of class, at least a second semester sophomore, and a minimum of 3 completed psychology courses (1 of the 3 may be a transfer course).
*Note, the psychology major GPA is calculated using all psychology courses a student has taken at Muhlenberg. (The degree audit feature in Capstone only uses 10 courses.)

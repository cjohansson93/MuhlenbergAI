          Disability Plan (Short-Term)
  








After 1 year of service - Available to employees in positions budgeted for at least 1,248 hours per year:
The Collegeâs short-term disability plan provides for replacement of all or part of income due to an employeeâs temporary disability stemming from a non-work related illness or injury.
In order to receive short-term disability benefits, an eligible employee must apply for leave under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA) by contacting the Office of Human Resources. Short-term disability benefits will be paid on approved claims during the employeeâs FMLA leave. All short-term disability absences require a physicianâs certification, submittal of a leave application, and physicianâs clearance to return to work. 
Full-time employees receive 10 days of short-term disability upon hire and accrue five days at the start of each additional year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks (130 days). Note: This accrual is pro-rated to reflect annual budgeted hours for those working less than 2,080 hours per year or on an hourly basis. 
Short-term disability benefits commence on the sixth business day for approved claims (employees are required to use sick leave, if available, for the first five days.)  Based on the duration of an approved, physician-certified absence, salary is paid at 100% of the budgeted base salary during a short-term disability absence for the number of working days (or hours) that have been accumulated in the employeeâs short-term disability leave bank. Once accumulated short-term disability time has been exhausted, the College will continue short-term disability pay at 60% of the individual's current base salary, up to a maximum of $4,000 per month (whichever is less). Short-term disability pay may not exceed 26 weeks.  The College reserves the right to request periodic updates to the physicianâs certification of disability.
Benefits (health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, retirement contributions, etc.) may be continued during a short-term disability absence as long as the employee remains eligible under the terms of the benefit plan document. The College will continue to make the regular employer contribution for benefits as if the employee were in active service during any month in which leave is being used under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and in which the College is continuing salary payments under the terms of the short-term disability plan. Employee contributions equal to those paid by active employees will be withheld from short-term disability checks issued by the College, while employees on unpaid FMLA will need to remit payment monthly in the amount equal to the normal payroll deduction for benefits they elect to continue.






          Disability Plan (Long-Term)
  








Coverage begins on the 1st of the month following completion of 1 year of service - Available to employees in positions budgeted for at least 1,248 hours per year:
The Long-Term Disability plan of the College is an insurance plan provided by an external vendor.  The College pays the entire long-term disability insurance premium, with no required employee contribution.
If an absence is expected to continue beyond 26 weeks, application for benefits must be initiated prior to the first day of the fifth consecutive month of disability. Applications filed for long-term disability require a physicianâs certification. Eligibility for benefits is determined by the insurance company, subject to the provisions of the plan.  Approved long-term disability claims are paid by the insurer, not the College.
If a long-term disability claim is approved by the insurer, benefits begin on the first of the month following 26 weeks of total disability and continue for the duration of such disability until the attainment of age 65. However, if the disability commences after age 60, benefit continuation is governed by the terms of the policy; benefits will continue no longer than twelve months if the disability commences at age 69 and over.  Continuation of long-term disability payments require periodic physician certification of continued disability in satisfaction of the carrier's policy guidelines. Complete details are available in the Human Resources Office.
No College contributions will be made toward benefits during a long-term disability absence and all College benefits will cease upon conversion to long-term disability. Employees may be eligible for continuation of benefits through COBRA and/or policy conversions.  Any questions, please contact Human Resources at ext. 3165.

You may make changes to your health insurance plan when a qualifying event takes place (i.e. marriage, birth of a child, divorce, change in spouse's employment status, etc.), and/or during the annual open enrollment period, which typically runs in the November time frame, with changes taking effect January 1.
(Medicare Part D Creditable Coverage Notice 2021)
You may choose to cover just yourself or you may add your spouse and/or eligible dependents to your health insurance coverage.  The College pays approximately 80% of the premium each month. The remaining 20% of the cost of coverage is deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis so that this portion of your income is not subject to federal income tax or social security tax.  If your spouse is eligible for medical coverage elsewhere, either through their own employer or Medicare, we encourage your spouse to enroll in that coverage. You may add your spouse who is eligible for their own employerâs coverage (or eligible for Medicare) to your health insurance by paying a spousal surcharge. To request a waiver of this surcharge, complete the Request for Waiver of Spousal Surcharge form, listed below.

Up to Age 40 - 2.50 times salary
Age 40 to 49 - 2.00 times salary

For more information, please review the Summary of Group Life Insurance Plan.
II. Optional Life Insurance: After meeting eligibility requirements, as part of a one-time âguaranteed issueâ enrollment window, newly eligible employees may elect to enroll in Optional Life Insurance (with or without Accidental Death & Dismemberment coverage) for yourself, your spouse and/or your dependent children. Newly eligible employees will have 30 days to elect up to $250,000 in optional life coverage and up to $50,000 in optional spouse coverage without providing evidence of insurability. Thereafter, any employee who chooses not to enroll during the guaranteed issue enrollment window, will be limited to benefit elections of no more than $20,000 (employee coverage) and $10,000 (spouse coverage) during the annual open enrollment period. Any coverage requested above these amounts will require evidence of insurability. Note: To elect spousal life insurance, the employee must also elect employee coverage.  Premiums vary based on age and coverage amounts.

Note: This is not a College benefit. The following is provided for information purposes only: Do you have federal direct student loans? Muhlenberg College is a tax-exempt employer under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which means the College is a qualifying employer under PSLF. Under this Program, if you work for the College in a position budgeted for at least 1,560 hours per year, you may be eligible to participate in PSLF. If you qualify, the Program forgives the remaining balance on your eligible Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for Muhlenberg College.
Only certain types of student loans are eligible. For information on which loans qualify, eligibility details on the program, and how to begin, please visit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF).

Available to employees working in positions budgeted for at least 1000 hours per year:
The College offers a 403(b) retirement plan admininstered by TIAA. Click TIAA Summary Plan Description for the summary plan description.
Employee Contribution: Employees working in positions budgeted for a minimum of 1,000 hours per year are eligible to contribute to the College's Supplemental Retirement Plan (SRA) immediately upon hire. Employees may contribute through pre-tax payroll deductions, up to the maximum IRS annual limits. Effective September 1, 2021, all new employees who are eligible to contribute to the Plan will be automatically enrolled to contribute 3% of base compensation on a pre-tax basis. This contribution will be invested in a Lifecycle Target Date Fund unless moved to another fund or funds by the employee. Employees are encouraged to contribute more than the minimum contribution, if possible, because every dollar makes a difference. Any new employee who wishes to opt out of auto-enrollment may do so by contacting Human Resources.
Employer Contribution (After 2 years of employment - minimum 1,000 budgeted hours/year): The College contributes to the  retirement plan following completion of the waiting period of two consecutive years (at 1,000 budgeted hours each year). This waiting period may be waived if your previous employer contributed to a fully vested retirement plan on your behalf within 90 days of your first day of employment at Muhlenberg.  Effective September 1, 2020, the College's retirement contribution decreased from 10% to 4% in response to the economic impact of COVID-19. Effective September 1, 2021, the College's retirement contribution increased from 4% to 5% of base salary, up to the current Social Security wage base, and 9% of any salary beyond that base.
Contact Human Resources at  HR@Muhlenberg.edu or ext. 3165 for information regarding individual appointments with a TIAA representative.

Available to employees working in positions budgeted for at least 850 hours per year:
Employees accumulate ten days (pro-rated based on annual budgeted hours) of sick time annually.

Employees who are eligible for the short-term disability plan may roll a maximum of five days of unused annual sick leave accumulation into their short-term disability bank each year. 
***Temporary Expansion of Sick-Leave Benefits, Effective March 12, 2020: Employees who need to stay home to care for a family member due to COVID-19 concerns or reasons such as school/daycare closings, and are unable to work remotely, may use time from their sick leave bank. If sick leave has been exhausted, you may request an advancement of up to 10 additional days by contacting Human Resources. Absences for those not eligible for paid sick leave will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  This is a temporary expansion to policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and will end on June 30, 2022 for non-exempt staff and August 31, 2022 for exempt employees. Normally, sick leave may only be used for the employeeâs own illness or injury.

Available to Staff working in positions budgeted for at least 850 hours per year: 
 
I. STAFF ASSOCIATES & SERVICE PERSONNEL: Non-exempt Staff paid on a biweekly basis earn vacation, as follows:
CURRENT VACATION ACCRUAL POLICY - EXPIRING 6/30/22:

A part-time staff member who normally works 4 hours a day in a position budgeted for 1000 hours per year, would charge 4 hours to vacation. (50% of the full-time equivalent) 
A full-time staff member who normally works 7 hours a day in a position budgeted for 1820 hours per year, would charge 7 hours per day to vacation. (87.5% of the full-time equivalent)
A full-time staff member who normally works 8 hours a day in a position budgeted for 2080 hours per year, would charge 8 hours per day to vacation. (100% full-time)

As always, requests for vacation leave require your managerâs pre- approval.
Accumulation of vacation leave for staff associates and service personnel runs from July 1 of one year through June 30 of the next year. Carryover each July 1 is capped at the amount of vacation time earned in the preceding 12 months plus 10 additional days. For example, a staff member earning 15 days of vacation per year may carry-over a maximum of 25 days vacation into the next year.

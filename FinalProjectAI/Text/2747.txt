chorney lowerssteeplechase record


David Chorney ran his third career steeplechase at the Swarthmore Last Chance Meet, and for the third time he broke the school record.

The Muhlenberg junior finished fourth in his last competition of the season with a time of 9:24.48. Although he fell short of the NCAA provisional
qualifying standard of 9:23.00, he did take more than three seconds off the school record he set at the Centennial Conference Championships.

Chorney was one of four Mules to win places at Swarthmore. Sophomore Alex Faust finished third in the pole vault (10-6), sophomore Caitlin Heffern was sixth
in the javelin (99-7), and sophomore Joseph Dyer was seventh in the triple jump (41-3).

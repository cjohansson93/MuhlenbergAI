Galletta Wins Bracket at Mount St. Vincent
 Saturday, January 19, 2013 - page 3







					 





Galletta, who was 3-11 when he last wrestled for the Mules as a freshman, is 7-4 this season.


With none of his teammates or coaches on the Muhlenberg wrestling team within 100 pounds of him, senior Chris Galletta has a bit of a problem when he learns new moves: He doesn’t have anyone his size to practice them on.

“The first time I get to try these moves live is in a match,” he said. “I have no idea how my opponent is going to react. I’m just like, ‘I hope this works!’”

It certainly worked at the Mount St. Vincent Invitational, where Galletta swept through four matches to win the heavyweight bracket. It was the first tournament title for a Mule this season.

Galletta’s first match was his most competitive. Against an Ursinus wrestler who had beaten him the week before, Galletta trailed 2-1 late in the third period before getting an escape with seven seconds left to tie the score. His opponent then took his second injury timeout, conceding a point that gave Galletta the 3-2 win.

“It was nice to get a little revenge,” said Galletta. “The coaches showed me how to use my size to my advantage. I wanted to go neutral, but they told me to take bottom and it worked.”

From there it was smooth sailing for Galletta, who won his first tournament since high school. He pinned an opponent from Waynesburg, then repeated the pattern of his first two wins by decisioning different wrestlers from Ursinus and Waynesburg, winning 5-0 in the final.

The title was extra special for Galletta, who lives about 20 minutes away from Mount St. Vincent.

“It was awesome,” he said. “My parents were there, and one of my friends came to see me. I can’t thank my coaches and teammates enough.”

Two of those teammates also enjoyed success in the non-scoring tournament. Senior Matt Parker won three of his five bouts to place fifth at 149. And freshman Jimmy Coiley went 2-2, scoring both of his wins by fall.

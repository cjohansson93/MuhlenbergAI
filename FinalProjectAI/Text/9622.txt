The recent floods in Texas and Louisiana have impacted students from the Lehigh Valley who are enrolled at colleges and universities in the flooded areas. Muhlenberg, along with other Lehigh Valley colleges, is participating in a temporary enrollment program to support those local students whose college educations would otherwise be disrupted by these events.
In addition to Muhlenberg, Cedar Crest College, DeSales University, Lafayette College, Lehigh University and Moravian College have agreed to offer students that are enrolled in colleges affected by the flooding the opportunity to take courses on a space-available basis. This temporary enrollment will provide these students the opportunity to continue their education until they can return safely to their college or university in the flooded area.
For more information on whom to contact at each campus and to discuss temporary enrollment options, affected Lehigh Valley residents should visit lvaic.org/hurricane-harvey.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential, liberal arts college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, humanities, natural sciences and social sciences as well as selected pre-professional programs, including accounting, business, education and public health. A member of the Centennial Conference, Muhlenberg competes in 22 varsity sports. Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

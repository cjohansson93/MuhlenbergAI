Psychology Department Mission Statement
The Psychology Department at Muhlenberg College aims to create a culture of informed engagement. Our students will interact differently with the world as a result of studying psychology and will understand psychology differently through engaging with the world. We cultivate an appreciation for a liberal arts education, including psychologyâs contributions to other disciplines and the contributions of those disciplines to psychology. Students are encouraged to be intellectually curious and adventurous; wrestling with challenges leads to a better understanding of their own and othersâ perspectives.
 
Goals for the Psychology Curriculum
Our engaged faculty members seek to prepare students for meaningful careers and to foster excitement for life-long learning. Our curricular goals are grounded in best practices articulated by the American Psychological Association. We expect psychology students to:

Build a strong knowledge base in psychology through learning core scientific models, findings, and theories.
Develop strong scientific and critical thinking skills through the use of diverse methods of inquiry.
Understand the role of cultural and individual differences and commonalities in order to meet their ethical and social responsibilities in a diverse world.
Develop strong interpersonal and communication skills including writing, speaking, and listening.    
Optimize their professional development by responsibly balancing independence and teamwork.

See how our curriculum is aligned with these goals here.

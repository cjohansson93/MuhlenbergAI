Men's Soccer Speeds Past Bullets

Faster than a speeding bullet? Maybe not. But that didnt stop the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team from scoring two goals in the second half to notch a 2-0 win over Gettysburg at Varsity Field.

With two conference games remaining, one against second-place Dickinson and one against last-place Ursinus, the Mules are now tied with Franklin & Marshall for fourth place in the Centennial Conference. The top five teams earn spots in the CC playoffs.



“We know that these last few games are all must-win, so this is basically getting that started for us,” said senior co-captain Nate Squire. “We need momentum going into the end of the season, especially against Dickinson on Wednesday.”

Squire had an assist on the Mules’ second goal of the night, which came in the 64th minute. He hit junior Jonathan Schauer with a centering free kick from the right side of the field, and Schauer put it away over the goalie’s head for his first goal of the season. Squire leads the team with three assists on the year.

The Mules’ first goal came less than 45 seconds after the halftime break when junior Jeff Reinhart drew the Gettysburg goalie off his line with a cross into the box. Senior Cody Antonini settled the ball and tapped it into the right side of the net for his 13th goal of the season.

“We seemed ready to go right after halftime. Maybe Coach Topping is giving us good halftime speeches,” laughed Squire.

The Mules (10-4, 4-3) reeled off 25 shots throughout the game, outshooting the Bullets (6-8-1, 1-5-1) by 11 in their first win by more than one goal in almost a month.

Sophomore Danny Pinto (left) made a career-high six saves to get his first shutout as a Mule in his second start.

“Anytime you get a shutout that’s an accomplishment. He made a couple of big saves that not every keeper would have gotten to,” stated Squire.

It was only fitting that two of Muhlenberg’s seniors played a part in the goals on Senior Night. In addition to Squire and Antonini, the senior class also includes Jon Majoros, Kyle Plifka and Danny Way.

“We’ve all worked so hard for the program and this win is representative of what we have put in during our careers here,” said Squire.

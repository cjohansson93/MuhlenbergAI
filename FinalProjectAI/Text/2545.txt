For the third time in his career, senior Connor Winter of the Muhlenberg football team was named special teams player of the week by the Centennial Conference. 
Winter booted two field goals, including a career-best 45-yarder, and punted four times for a 37.8-yard average in the Mules’ season-opening 34-0 shutout at Wilkes. He also was a perfect 4-for-4 on extra points.
The 45-yard field goal, which gave Muhlenberg its first points of the season, came with 5:23 left in the first quarter and was a yard longer than his previous best, kicked last year at Johns Hopkins. Winter added a 33-yard field goal to cap the scoring early in the fourth quarter.
Winter’s long punt of 42 yards was downed at the 5-yard line late in the first quarter, and after the defense held on three plays, the Mules took possession on the Wilkes 34 and scored their first touchdown six plays later.

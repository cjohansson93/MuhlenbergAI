Sarah Kersh, a 2003 graduate of Muhlenberg College senior, has received a Jacob K. Javits Fellowship for the 2005-06 academic year. Kersh, who plans to enter a doctoral program in English in the fall, will receive up to $41,800 per year for four years of graduate study.
Kersh, an Allentown resident, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Muhlenberg with an English major and an art minor. Since graduation, she has been employed at the Crime Victim’s Council. She is the daughter of Ronald and Nancy Kersh of Westchester, Pa.
Originally designated the National Graduate Fellowship Program (NGFP), introduced into law by Senator Jacob K. Javits (R-NY), the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship Program provides financial assistance to students of superior ability, as demonstrated by their achievements and exceptional promise, to undertake study at the doctoral and Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) level in selected fields of the arts, humanities and social sciences. After Senator Javits’ death in 1986, his Congressional colleagues redesignated the NGFP the Jacob K. Javits Fellows Program in his honor.

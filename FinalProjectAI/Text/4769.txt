faust, lynch headed back to nationals



For the third time in 15 months, Alex Faust and Jennifer Lynch will be taking a road trip to the middle of the country together.

The two members of the Muhlenberg women’s track and field team, who graduated yesterday, received bids to the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championships. The three-day
meet is scheduled to begin Thursday at Baldwin-Wallace College in Bera, Ohio.

Faust and Lynch both qualified for the NCAA indoor meet in 2009 and again in 2010. Faust also competed in the outdoor meet last year and is the first athlete (male or female)
in Muhlenberg track and field history to make the NCAA field four times. This will be the the fourth time in the NCAAs for Lynch, but only the third in track: She was part of
the women’s soccer team that earned an NCAA bid last fall.

Faust will be looking to become a three-time All-American in the pole vault. She finished seventh outdoors in 2009 and sixth indoors in 2010; she had the sixth-best pole vault
in Division III this season.

Lynch is the lowest-seeded of the 19 qualifiers in the 1,500 meters. She finished 15th and 13th in the mile in her first two NCAA runs.

Both events are slated for Thursday, with Faust vaulting at 1:00 and Lynch running at 4:15. The final of the 1,500 is scheduled for Saturday at 1:20.

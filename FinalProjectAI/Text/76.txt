Broad-Ranging. Innovative. Boundary-breaking. World-class.
That's the Muhlenberg Theatre & Dance Departmental Season. Dance performances from intimate contemporary solos to grand-scale ballet. Theatre productions from experimental blackbox to Broadway-style musicals â all delivered with the professionalism and vision of a professional repertory company.
As of March 2022, patrons are no longer required to be vaccinated in order to attend performances. Masks must be worn into and throughout the performance.

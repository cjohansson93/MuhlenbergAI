track teams sprint into final day


The Muhlenberg track and field teams received outstanding performances from their sprinters in the preliminaries on the second day of the Centennial Conference Championships.

Although the Mule women were in fifth place and the men 




Senior Patrick Thornton ran on the 4x800-meter relay team that came in fourth.




were tied for fifth, both are poised to move up in the final standings after qualifying multiple athletes for the finals.

The men in particular enjoyed a stellar day, filling half the field of the 200-meter final. Sophomore Peter Rice posted the fastest qualifying time, just ahead of 




Senior Janelle Mentrikoski qualifed for the final in the 400-meter hurdles for the third time in her career.






freshman Isaiah Vaughn.  Senior Jeremiah Lachaud and freshman Kyle Sullivan also qualified for the final.

Vaughn, Lachaud and Sullivan all advanced to the final in the 100 
meters, and Rice qualified for the 400 final.

Junior Bobby Torphy had the second-fastest time in the 800 trials, and seniors Brendan Kirk and Matt Stein qualified for the final in the 400 hurdles.

In events that were completed, sophomore Marc Brookland earned a silver medal in the long jump. Sophomore Michael Baer was fifth in the decathlon, improving the score from his first career decathlon two weeks ago by 239 points.

The womens competition featured more noteworthy performances from senior Alex Faust, who notched the fastest qualifying time in both the 200 and 400. She broke her own school record in the 200, clocking a 25.55 to knock three-tenths of a second off the mark she set earlier this season.

Despite finishing only fourth, the 4x800 relay team of sophomores Kimberlee Yalango and Nicolette Miller, freshman Erica Bash and senior Jennifer Lynch shattered the school record set two years ago by nearly 15 seconds. Yalango qualified for the 800 final.

Freshman Amanda Brennan placed fourth in the long jump and qualified for the final in the 100 hurdles.

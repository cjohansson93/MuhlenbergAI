Young Volleyball Players Show Promise in Buttermaker

Despite dropping its first two matches at the Buttermaker Tournament, the Muhlenberg volleyball team showed considerable promise in the second match.

After falling in three sets to Messiah – the only team to go through the first day of the Buttermaker without losing a set – the Mules took on a Kean team that had just finished a five-set match against Neumann. Muhlenberg pounced all over the Cougars, scoring the first two points and never looking back.

The score was 10-7 before the Mules ran off 14 straight points behind the serving of freshman Nikki Dickson, who had two aces, two assists and a kill in the big run. After her streak was finally interrupted by a service error, Kean committed a service error of its own to end the first set at 25-8. It was the teams biggest margin of victory in a set since a 25-6 win against Bryn Mawr in 2009.

Kean came back to capture the next two sets and looked to be in charge when it opened up a 17-11 advantage in the fourth. But the Mules, playing a young lineup with four freshmen on the floor most of the time, stormed back to take a 23-20 lead. Muhlenberg served for the set at 24-22, but the Cougars scored the next three points and eventually won, 27-25.

Dickson, playing setter for the entire match, finished with career highs of 20 assists and 13 digs. Senior Davi Gordon led a balanced attack with 7 kills, while Dickson and two other freshmen, Holly Hynson (left) and Alexis Inselberg, had 5 apiece. Inselberg added 11 digs, and yet another freshman, Alyssa Schell pulled up a team-high 14 digs.

<p></p>Muhlenberg tabbed <b>Megan Eddinger</b> to fill the vacant position of senior woman administrator.
<p></p>
Eddinger has been head coach of the Muhlenberg field hockey team since 2004, compiling a record of 59-49 and leading the Mules to the first back-to-back Centennial
Conference playoff appearances in their history. A 2001 graduate of Gettysburg, Eddinger served as an assistant coach at Muhlenberg for three years before taking over the
head reins.

alt="Alexa Keckler">
<b>Alexa Keckler</b>, the coach at Centennial Conference rival Gettysburg for the last five years, is the new head volleyball coach at Muhlenberg. She replaces Jenny Warmack-Chipman, who left in March after 10 years to become head coach at St. Mary&#8217;s (Texas) University.
<p></p>
Keckler compiled a record of 96-55 (.636) in her five seasons at Gettysburg, including a 40-10 (.800) CC mark. The Bullets posted at least 18 wins in each of her five seasons and captured their league-best 11th CC championships in 2005. In 2008, Gettysburg was 9-1 in the CC, earning the right to host the conference playoffs.
<p></p>
Last year, the Bullets&#8217; 19-9 record included a 7-3 CC mark. In Keckler&#8217;s five years as 
head coach, 19 Gettysburg players landed on the All-CC team, including six on the first team.
<p></p>
Keckler inherits a Muhlenberg team that went 11-13 and earned its first CC playoff berth in eight years in 2009. Ironically, the Mules

beat Keckler&#8217;s Gettysburg squad in the final match of the regular season to qualify for the playoffs.
<p></p>
In addition to her volleyball duties Keckler will serve as Muhlenberg&#8217;s assistant director of recreation and teach fitness and wellness classes. 
<p></p>
Before taking over at Gettysburg, Keckler piloted her alma mater of Smithsburg (Md.) High School to an 18-2 record in 2002 and guided Littlestown (Pa.) High School to an 18-5 mark and a district playoff appearance in 2004. In between those assignments, she served as head coach of the Tri-State FCA Volleyball Club&#8217;s 15-and-under girls team, leading that squad to a 49-25 record in 2003-04. 
<p></p>
An all-region most valuable player and junior college All-American at Hagerstown Community College, Keckler earned her associate&#8217;s degree in 1998 before graduating from Trevecca Nazarene (Tenn.) University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in sports and exercise science in 2000. She was a two-year letterwinner with the TNU volleyball program, earning TranSouth Athletic Conference academic honors both seasons. 
<p></p>
She acquired a master&#8217;s degree in human performance from Frostburg State University in 2002 and also has CAP 2 coaching certification from USA Volleyball. In addition to her coaching duties, she has served as the director of the Mid-Maryland Volleyball Camp since 1996. 
<p></p>
Keckler and her husband, Drew University men&#8217;s basketball head coach Darryl Keckler, have two daughters, Olivia, 4, and Camryn (8 months).

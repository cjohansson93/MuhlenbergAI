Past Events
Vincent Who? Documentary screening and talk with Curtis ChinIn 1982, at the height of anti-Japanese sentiments arising from massive layoffs in the auto industry, a Chinese-American named Vincent Chin was beaten to death in Detroit by two white autoworkers. Chinâs killers got off with a $3,000 fine and three years probation, but no jail time. Vincent Who? asks how far Asian Americans have come since then and how far they have yet to go.

Her ongoing work in the border provinces of Kashmir analyzes the relationship between dams, environmental and ecological imaginaries, and Indiaâs counterinsurgency politics.
Lecture: Atiq Rahman, âResilience Building in the Anthropocene: Lessons from BangladeshâAtiq Rahman is a prominent environmentalist, scientist, and development expert from Bangladesh. He is well-known worldwide for his pioneering role and contribution to environment and nature conservation, climate change, poverty alleviation and sustainable development.

âAcademic Freedom and the Study of Religionâ, Dr. Wendy Doniger
The religion studies department is pleased to host Dr. Wendy Doniger, University of Chicagoâs Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions. Her visit will include a public lecture and faculty workshop, as part of the Mellon Visiting Scholars in the Humanities series.
Donigerâs book The Hindus: An Alternative History, published in 2009, was challenged by Hindu conservatives and the original publisher, Penguin India, eventually agreed to cease publication of the book and destroy any remaining copies. The book has since been republished in India by a new publishing company. In an op-ed published in The Chronicle of Higher Education in April 2016, Dr. Doniger argues that her own experience and that of other scholars reflect a double threat to academic freedom: religious actors attempting to control both who can speak about a religion and which aspects of the religion should be represented. Her talk will address issues of academic freedom and freedom of speech as well as the role that religion studies plays in both thinking through these issues and in dealing with a planet in the death grip of religious hatreds.

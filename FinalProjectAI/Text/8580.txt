Mission
The environmental science program at Muhlenberg College strives to engage students through an interdisciplinary curriculum firmly grounded in the natural sciences. Through classroom, laboratory, and field experiences, students use science to assess, quantify, and analyze human impacts on natural environments. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills are strengthened through investigations of environmental problems and their solutions. Students also take courses in politics, economics, and the humanities to learn about the complex social context within which environmental scientists conduct their work. Opportunities to carry out independent research projects, serve as an intern in industry, advocacy, and educational organizations, and study abroad, complement traditional classroom experiences and promote a practical understanding of earthâs natural systems.






A major in environmental science prepares students for a wide range of careers in industry, government, and academia. Many recent graduates have pursued work in environmental consulting, environmental regulation, non-profit organizations, and education. Others have continued to graduate school in a wide range of fields including environmental science, ecology, oceanography, forestry, urban planning, law, medicine, and toxicology.

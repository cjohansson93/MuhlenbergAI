judges sentence women’s basketballto end of season 


A 20-0 run in the first half spelled the difference as Brandeis defeated Muhlenberg in the Round of 16 of the NCAA Division III Tournament, ending the Mules’ fantastic season with a record of 26-4.

Muhlenberg led 10-9 with 15:32 left in the first half, then went almost eight minutes without scoring. The Mules missed nine shots and committed three turnovers in the drought, which ended with the Judges ahead 29-10 and less than eight minutes left in the half.

Senior Erin McSherry ended the dry spell with 



McKeon scored 21 of her 25 points in the second half. She finished the year with 254 rebound – the fourth-highest single-season total in team history.



a jumper, and although Brandeis  (20-7) extended its lead to 20, Muhlenberg closed the first half on an 8-0 run to go into the locker room down 12, 36-24.

The Mules threatened in the second half but could not get the deficit to single digits until senior Lauren Boyle’s jumper with 7:41 left made the score 59-51. The gap got as low as seven, but the Judges made 12 of their last 13 free throws to put the game away.

“It seemed like we were on the edge so many times - we get one stop and one score, and we’d be over the hump,” said Muhlenberg head coach Ron Rohn. “They always came up with the big play.

“We did not execute as crisply as we would have liked in that stretch where they got the big lead. There’s a lot of emotion in a game like this and we were just trying a little too hard. Once we settled down, we were fine.”

Brandeis shot better than 50 percent from the field and had all five scorers in double figures. 

Sophomore Kelly McKeon led Muhlenberg with a career-high 25 points. She also pulled down 11 rebounds and dished out five assists without a turnover in 39 minutes. Freshman Alexandra Chili scored 15 points, setting a school record with 480 points for the season.

Boyle, in the final game of her career, scored 11 to surpass the 1,500-point mark. She finished with 1,505.

“It’s bittersweet,” said Boyle on the end of her career. “We made it so far – to the Sweet 16 – and that’s a great accomplishment in itself. We made a lot of history this year. I wouldn’t change it for anything.”

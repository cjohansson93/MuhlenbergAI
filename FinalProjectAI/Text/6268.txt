Championship Preview: Wrestlers Looking to Earn Their Places
 Wednesday, February 22, 2012 - page 3







					 


For the Muhlenberg wrestling team, the trip to Saturday’s Centennial Conference Championships is all about quality, not quantity.

The Mules may be sending only four wrestlers to Gettysburg, but senior Kevin Homan believes all four have a chance to make the podium. And coming off their final tri-match of the season in which Muhlenberg wrestlers went 5-0 in contested bouts, he believes they are peaking at the right time.




Homan is tied for the team lead with seven pins. His 28 wins are the most by a Mule since 2009.



“We’ve been wrestling pretty well all season,” Homan said. “Coming off a weekend when we went undefeated, I definitely feel like we’re ready to make some noise. I expect us to have a couple placers.”

Homan leads the Mules with a 28-7 record this season, the best mark amongst CC 149 pounders. He has knocked off the second seed each of the last three seasons and looks to get back on the podium after placing second two years ago and third as a freshman.

Classmate John Sternlicht boasts the Mules’ top mark in CC matches (7-1) and looks to replicate his performance from last season when he won three straight bouts, including two by pin, to place third. Seven of his 10 wins this season have come by fall.

Speaking of falls, senior heavyweight Nick Pallotta has the potential to pick up a pin almost every time he takes the mat. He leads active Mules with 34 career falls, including five of his eight wins this season.

Junior Matt Parker rounds out the Mule contingent at 141 pounds, where he has posted six wins this season.

Mathematically, Muhlenberg could not win a CC dual this season, but the Mules went a combined 18-11 in conference bouts. With forfeits no longer a factor, they hope to repeat their performances from the past two seasons when after going winless in CC duals, they beat teams at the championships.

And with what Homan called four strong wrestlers, he believes they have the ability to make some noise. This meet is what they’ve been working toward all season, he added, and he and his two classmates want to go out in style.

“We’ve got a lot of potential this weekend,” Homan said. “If we can go in there and have all four guys place, which I think is very possible, that would really make a statement.

“A lot depends on whose day it is and who is wrestling well on that day, but I definitely think we’re going to do pretty well this weekend.”

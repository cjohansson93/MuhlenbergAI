Records keep falling for women’s lax


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team continued updating the record books in a 16-12 road victory against York. 

The win was the 11th of the season for the Mules (11-3), breaking the school record of 10 set in 2006. The 16 goals gave the squad 213 for the campaign, unseating the mark of 208 set in 2003.

Senior Taylor Armstrong broke the single-season record for assists, as she dished out four against the Spartans. Thus the Mountain Lakes, N.J., native has accumulated a total of 44

The Muhlenberg softball team was swept in its final non-conference doubleheader of the season, 5-0 and 9-7 by Messiah.

In the second game, the Mules knocked out the Falcons’ top pitcher by scoring five runs in the bottom of the first. Freshman Ashley Brewer hit a two-run single, and freshman Jess Kasza and sophomore Jenna Van Waalwijk later added RBI doubles to the left-center gap.

Messiah (18-14) crept back, tying the score with two out in the top of the seventh to send the contest into extra innings. The Falcons plated four runs in the top of the eighth. Muhlenberg responded with two of its own before the game ended with the potential tying runs on base.

Women’s Golf



The Muhlenberg women’s golf team finished fifth at the Dickinson Invitational in its final competition before hosting the Centennial Conference Championships.

Junior Hayley Cush shot a 97, one stroke off her career low. Sophomore Sarah Mellick also shot in double digits, carding a 99.






for the 2008 campaign, leaving in second place former record-holder Shannon Donohue, who amassed 42 helpers during the 2006 season. 

“I worked really hard for this record,” Armstrong said. “It was 



Morrongiello recorded her 18th career hat trick and also snagged five draw controls.



a huge challenge for me to assist behind the goal, especially when most defenders are taller than me.”

Junior Ruth Morrongiello reached the 100-goal plateau, becoming only the seventh player in school history to hit the century mark. 

“[Scoring the 100th goal] had been on my mind the last few games and I just couldn’t finish it off,” said Morrongiello, who was stuck at 99 after not scoring a goal Saturday at Swarthmore. “But today I just decided to play my game and not to think much about it and it happened.”

The Mules also remained undefeated in non-conference clashes for the third straight season. The success against York was their 22nd in a row against non-league opposition, a stretch during which Muhlenberg won by an average margin of 7.8 goals.

However, the encounter against York (11-5) wasn’t one of the easiest for the Mules.

Muhlenberg opened an 8-4 cushion at halftime, but the Spartans needed less than 11 minutes to tie the score at nine with 19:04 remaining.

After the two teams traded two goals apiece, Jaclyn VanLuit made the score 12-11 for the hosts, giving them their first and only lead of the game with 14 minutes left. From that moment on, Muhlenberg regained its first-half intensity and went on a five-goal run to close the encounter, 16-12. 

“We talked that it was going to be a hard game, and even when we trailed in the second half, we knew we could do it,” Armstrong said. 

Sophomore Amanda McGovern scored three of her team-high five goals down that game-turning stretch, including the game-winning goal at the 11:59 mark. Her last three goals came after free position shots.

Morrongiello and Alyssa Bascelli, who also finished the game with a hat trick, added one goal apiece in the dying minutes.   

The triumph was a warmup for Saturday’s Centennial Conference clash against McDaniel, which will be decisive for the playoff spots distribution in the league.

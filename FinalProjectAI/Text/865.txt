Rebecca Romano ’14 ran for student body president as a sophomore in the fall of 2011 with the odds stacked against her. At the time, she had only served one previous term on the Student Government Association (SGA), and her opponent was an upperclassman. Yet after a week of dorm storming, hanging up posters and giving speeches to every major organization on campus, she won the election. Romano had taken her first step towards a two-year legacy. 
Following in the footsteps of her friend and former student body president, Jonathan B. Landau ‘12, Romano immediately entered the position with passion and enthusiasm.
“First and foremost,” Romano says, “the goal of SGA representatives is to make sure we are representing and advocating for students on campus to positively impact campus life. That was what I wanted to do, to represent those agendas.”
Romano pursued projects that she knew would benefit the student body and campus as a whole. She helped bring digital signage to Seegers Union as well as off-campus dining options for students, two projects that had attracted student interest. But Romano considers her greatest triumph to be working with College management to bring coffee to Trexler Library. 
For years, students had expressed enthusiasm for the possibility, so Romano faced the challenge head on. She addressed the proposal and planning stages with campus administration, Seegers Union and Dining Services staff and Carol Shiner Wilson, former dean of academic life, to resolve logistical issues in the procurement, placement and installation of a beverage service. Thanks to that hard work and collaboration, there is now a Starbucks iCup machine in the library for all guests to enjoy.
Romano’s two-term presidency has come to a close. Now, she passes the baton to Brandon Hamilton ‘16.
 “An important lesson I learned as student body president is you’re never going to make everybody happy,” she says. “You just have to do the best you can, and really just take it in stride, one day at a time.”
Romano reflects positively on her presidency as an invaluable leadership and life experience.  She walks away with her head held high, knowing she improved the campus the best she could.

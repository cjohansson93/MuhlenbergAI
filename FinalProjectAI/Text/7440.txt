Baseball Falls to DeSales in Last Game Before Playoffs
 Monday, April 28, 2014 - page 3







					 




DeSales defeated Muhlenberg, 9-5, in a game between two baseball teams looking ahead to this week’s conference playoffs.

The Bulldogs (25-13), the top seed in the Freedom Conference playoffs, and Mules (16-18-1), the third seed in the Centennial Conference
playoffs, combined to use 11 pitchers, none for more than three innings. Muhlenberg used many players who haven’t seen much
action recently.

After falling behind 4-0, the Mules rallied, as has been their recent habit. Freshman Thomas Yohe (left) drove 
in the first run with his first career hit, a two-out single up the middle in the fourth. 

Muhlenberg tied the score with three in the fifth, an inning that included back-to-back bunt singles by freshman John Icaza
 and senior Tyler Latrenta. Seniors John Scuderi and Max Litvak brought in the first two
runs with a single and sacrifice fly, respectively, and junior Kurt Johnson singled in the tying run.

DeSales scored in each of the last four innings, however, and went on to its 10th straight win.

Sophomore Josh Scheon pitched a strong two innings in relief, striking out four of the six batters he faced. Junior Chris Flynn
came off the bench to go 2-for-2.

Sunday at 1:00 with a berth in the Sweet 16 at stake. (times corrected 11/10)

This is the 14th NCAA Tournament berth for the Mules and their first since 2007, when they received an at-large bid and lost to Virginia Wesleyan in the first round. Muhlenberg has not won an NCAA Tournament game since 1997, going 0-4-1 since defeating Messiah in the second round that year. The Mules did advance to the second round in 2003, winning on penalty kicks after tying Gordon.

Muhlenberg (11-2-6) played four of the other 59 teams in the field, going 1-2-2 with a win against DeSales, two one-goal losses to Swarthmore and ties with New York University and Johns Hopkins. The Centennial Conference is sending at least three teams to the NCAA Tournament for the third time in four years. Last year, Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore were both eliminated in the round of 16.

Keene State (14-4-2) was an automatic qualifier after winning the Little East Conference championship. The Owls are in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2006, when they went 1-1. They made eight NCAA appearances between 1997 and 2006.

Keene State also played four of the other NCAA qualifiers, going 2-1-1 with wins against Kean and Eastern Connecticut State, a 5-0 loss to Babson and a scoreless draw with Salem State.

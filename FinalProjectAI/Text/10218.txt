Rachel Mansfield â12âwhose Instagram account, @rachlmansfield, has more than 350,000 followersâturned her online influence into a book deal: Her first cookbook, Just the Good Stuff, came out in February. We asked the media & communication and business administration double major about her journey from food and lifestyle blogger (at rachlmansfield.com) and Instagrammer to published author.
Muhlenberg Magazine Why did you start your blog?Rachel Mansfield I began sharing recipes when I was working full-time at a consumer packaged goods brand. I felt I was undervalued and undercompensated, and my passion for all things food and wholesome recipes was really taking off. A few months later, I was fired from my job and pursued my side hustle full-time.
MM How did you amass such a large Instagram following?RM It took a lot of hard work, a lot of mindless hours staring at my phone and engaging with others on the app to grow my account. I also share recipes that my readers crave and are feasible to make in their own home.
MM Have you always been into cooking?RM I learned how to cook at 23 from my mother-in-law. I have no culinary experience, and I think thatâs been the number-one reason why people enjoy my recipes: Theyâre simple. Theyâre made with easy ingredients and minimal steps.
MM How did the cookbook come about?RM I felt it was time to branch out of the digital space. I love Instagram and my blog, but I wanted something offline, something that my community can take home. I sought out an agent, then I wrote a proposal and it went out to publishing houses. My book was in a bidding warâI was totally shocked! It is surreal to me that I am in bookstores now.
MM How long did it take you to get the book ready, and how was that process different from the work youâd done before?RM It took me about a year to develop and perfect all the recipes. Iâm so used to creating recipes in my kitchen, posting them and getting an immediate reaction. Now itâs 100 recipes that people havenât seen yet. Writing a book is isolating, in a way, but it is so rewarding now seeing my readers love all of the âgood stuffâ I made for us.

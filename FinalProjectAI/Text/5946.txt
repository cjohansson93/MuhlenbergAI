Men's Soccer Plays Scoreless Tie

Chojnowski made six of his seven saves in the second period, when the Lions took 15 shots.


There were plenty of shots when the men's soccer teams from Muhlenberg and New Jersey met in a non-conference game, but no goals.

The Mules (6-2-1) and Lions (4-5-3) combined for 45 shots in an

entertaining game that featured end-to-end action throughout. 
The scoreless tie was the first at Varsity Field since 2004. 

Muhlenberg’s best chance to score came in the 67th minute, when the Lion goalie came out of the net to block a shot. The Mules took three shots with him out
of the goal, but TCNJ defenders prevented them from going in.

With junior Ari Nutovits banged up after a collision late in the first half, Muhlenberg turned to sophomore Jas Chojnowski
to start the second. Chojnowski had to make a save just 24 seconds into his first career varsity appearance and was solid throughout his debut, playing the final
65 minutes and recording seven saves.

Muhlenberg has not allowed a goal in its last 423 minutes at home.

TCNJ was playing its sixth game of the season against a team that was in the NCAA Tournament last year. Last week, the Lions played a 1-1 tie against Rutgers-Camden, which
is ranked 14th in Division III by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, and earlier in the season they beat Johns Hopkins.

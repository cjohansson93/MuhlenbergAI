Women's Golf Second at Home Tournament; Baseball Falls to Fords
 Monday, April 21, 2014 - page 2







					 




The Muhlenberg women’s golf team tuned up for the Centennial Conference Championships with some home cookin’.

The Mules turned in one of their best performances of the past six years, riding a balanced effort to a second-place finish at their spring home tournament. Their team score of 398 was just five shots off the pace set by team champion Eastern and marked the second strong outing of the year on their home course – the Mules carded a 395 in the fall, their lowest mark since the 2008 CC tournament. 

Muhlenberg wound up six strokes ahead of Manhattanville and 19 in front of fellow CC squad Ursinus.

Muhlenberg’s top four scorers finished within six strokes of each other in the final regular-season match ahead of this weekend’s conference championships. Freshman Emily Unrue led the way with a 96, good for a sixth-place tie in a field of 20 golfers. 

Senior Kristin Lang (right) placed eighth with a 99, and junior Laura Glogovsky rounded out the top half of the leaderboard with a career-best 101, three shots better than the previous low she set a month ago. Glogovsky recorded a birdie on the par-4 eighth hole.

Junior Christina Bryde was right behind Glogovsky with a 102 – including a 43 on the back nine – and sophomore Kerrilynn Lanza signed for a season-best 107.

The Muhlenberg baseball team lost a makeup game at home to Haverford, 11-4, further clouding the already murky Centennial Conference playoff picture.

With four games to play in the regular season, the Mules (15-15, 8-6) are in a three-way tie for second place – just three games ahead of two teams tied for last place. After first-place Gettysburg, which has already clinched a berth, the other nine teams all have a shot at playing their way into the playoffs with a strong finish.

Muhlenberg closes out with a home-and-home series against Dickinson and a home doubleheader against Johns Hopkins.

As in the first meeting, Muhlenberg fell into an early hole against the Fords (15-15, 8-6) and started a comeback with the long ball. With his team down 5-0 in the third, senior John Scuderi cranked a no-doubt-about-it three-run home run to left, his third round-tripper of the season. But 5-3 was a close as the Mules would get this time.

Scuderi also made some history with a pair of assists, tying the school record of 391 career assists.

Senior Brett Rosen and junior Danny Usewick each had two hits. Freshman Adam Pracher (left) threw three innings of one-hit relief.

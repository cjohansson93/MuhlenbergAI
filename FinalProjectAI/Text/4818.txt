cc strong in women’s tennis, men’s golf




As if they needed it, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis and men’s golf teams got more proof of just how tough the compeition in the
Centennial Conference is.

The women’s tennis team lost a hard-fought 5-4 decision to Haverford, ranked 11th in the Atlantic South Region. It was the fifth straight CC
loss for the Mules (3-7, 2-5), with four of them coming to teams ranked 13th or better in the region.

Muhlenberg won two of three doubles matches, but Haverford came back with four singles wins, two of which were very close. Junior Lindsay
Schmidt (left) was a winner at both doubles and singles.

Men’s golf finished fourth at the Ursinus Invitational – and fourth among CC teams. The tournament was held at the site of next
weekend’s CC Championships, and all seven CC squads participated in the tuneup. 

Sophomore Zack Meyers (right) led the Mules with an 80, one stroke ahead of three teammates.

Men’s tennis opens play at CC invite




Two Muhlenberg doubles teams and one singles player began competition at the first Centennial Conference Fall Invitational. The CC used to conduct an individual tournament in the spring, but switched to a team tournament in 2006. 

The doubles team of sophomore Robbie Goldwein and freshman Dan Zakheim won its consolation match against a Franklin & Marshall duo. The other doubles team 
(sophomore Jonathan Farber and freshman John Osborne) also went 1-1, defeating a pair from host Haverford in the consolation round. Osborne fell to the second
seed in the lone singles match of the day.

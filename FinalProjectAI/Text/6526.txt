Antonini Strikes Quickly Again; Women's Soccer Seniors Shine
 Saturday, September 1, 2012 - page 2







					 



At this rate, Cody Antonini will soon be scoring goals before the game starts.




One of the weapons the Mules used to slay the Red Dragons was a Lance – sophomore midfielder Lance Dotzman.



The two-time All-American scored a goal 65 seconds into the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team’s season-opening win against Elizabethtown. He was even quicker 
in the second game, heading in a cross from junior Jeff Reinhart just 12 seconds after the opening whistle against Cortland State.

Antonini added another goal midway through the second half to account for all the scoring in a 2-0 win as the Mules improved to 2-0.

It was the seventh career two-goal game for Antonini. His first goal was two seconds shy of the Centennial Conference record for quickest goal to start a game.

A two-time All-Centennial Conference back, Neary’s previous contribution to the offense consisted of two assists.



There may have been three freshmen in the starting line up for the women’s soccer team in its game against Penn State Altoona, but it was the seniors who 
stole the show.

All three seniors who played scored goals, and the Mules picked up their first win of the season, breaking a six-game losing streak dating back to last year with a
5-1 victory.

Senior Natalie Wizel, who came in with a career total of one goal, tallied the first and last goals for Muhlenberg. Senior Maggie Neary,
who has played almost every game for the Mules over the last four years, finally scored her first career goal on a long shot. And senior Alyssa Meola
converted a penalty kick after a hand ball in the box.

The freshmen got into the act too. Nicole Karsch netted her first career goal, and Macayla Baer had a pair of assists.

The five goals were the most scored by the Mules since midway through the 2010 season.

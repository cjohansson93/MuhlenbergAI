Should I Audition?
Dancers are enouraged to attend one of our Open House events and engage with the Dance faculty and students. While an audition is not required for admission to the college or the dance major, a strong interview and audition can improve your chances of admission, and an audition and interview are required for applicants who wish to be considered for talent scholarship.
Audition Days are designed for high school seniors. Juniors and sophomores interested in visiting the program should fill out the information request form to get more information or arrange a tour on non-Audition days. You can also email us at theatredance@muhlenberg.edu.
Find out more here about Audition Days and admission to Muhlenberg and the Department.
How do I audition?
Register for one of our Open House and Audition events. In the 2021-22 academic year, we will hold one event in November and one in January. If you are unable to attend an Open House, e-mail the department at theatredance@muhlenberg.edu, to make other arrangements.
Audition dates for 2021-22 are:     Saturday, Nov. 6, 2021     Saturday, Jan. 15, 2022 
Register now!
May I send a video audition?
Students are encouraged to audition in person, because we will get to know you and you will get to know Muhlenberg much better in person. If an in-person audition isn't possible, you are welcome to arrange a video audition and Zoom interview. Please contact Office Manager Gianna Neal to make arrangements.
All auditions must be completed prior to your application deadline: Nov. 15 for Early Decision I, Feb. 1 for Early Decision II and regular decision.
Video Audition Guidelines
What should I wear for the Open House classes and audition?
There's no specific dress code, but you should bring appropriate dance attire and footwear. Dress so that we have a clear view of your body alignment, placement, and joints, and please pull your hair back from your face. Your solo should be presented in the same classroom attire. No costumes necessary!
Are talent scholarships offered to incoming students?
Yes. An audition and interview are required for consideration for a Muhlenberg Talent Grant or Baker Scholarship. Scholarships range in size from $1,000 to $4,000 per year depending on talent level. Find out more.
What are the criteria for dance scholarships?
Dance scholarships are based on your current skills and your potential to contribute positively to the dance community at Muhlenberg. In addition to your past dance experiences, we place a high value on sustained commitment, generosity of spirit, and a desire to study dance in the context of a broad liberal arts education. Learn more about dance auditions.
Should I bring my own music for my solo?
Yes. For your solo, please bring your music. We can play tracks from a smartphone, mp3 player, or CD.
Are picture and rÃ©sumÃ© required?
Yes. The photo can just be your school photo; it does not need to be fancy or professionally done. It is only used as a means of identification. Your rÃ©sumÃ© should reflect work experience, extra-curricular activities, volunteer work, and other experience â both arts-related and non-arts-related. Please convert all files to PDFs.
Do I need to apply to Muhlenberg College before I audition?
No. However, students applying Early Decision 1 should audition by Dec. 1.
The application deadline for Early Decision 1 is Nov. 15. For both Early Decision 2 and regular decision, the deadline is Feb. 1. These dates have recently changed! If you are sure that you want to attend Muhlenberg, we encourage you to apply Early Decision. Visit the College's Admissions website for details.

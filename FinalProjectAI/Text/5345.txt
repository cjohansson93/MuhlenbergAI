women’s basketball completes sweep



Men’s Basketball Falls Just Short


Muhlenberg nearly pulled off an upset of a team that has been ranked in the top 10 in Division III this season, but Gettysburg overcame a 17-point second-half deficit to win, 51-49.

The Mules (5-5, 1-3) scored the first seven points of the second half to open up a 37-20 lead, but made only four field goals the rest of the way. The Bullets (8-2, 3-1) took the lead on a three-pointer with 4:20 to play and stole the ball in the backcourt for a layup seconds later. The quick five points gave Gettysburg a 49-45 lead.

Muhlenberg held the Bullets to one basket over the final four minutes, but missed two three-pointers with a chance to take the lead. Trailing 51-49, the Mules took possession with 19 seconds left following a Gettysburg miss, but a potential game-tying jumper at the buzzer was off the mark.

Muhlenberg, which entered the week 10th in Division III in field-goal percentage defense, held Gettysburg to 32.7-percent shooting. The Bullets went for more than 10 minutes without a field goal in the first half.

Junior Ryan Foster led the Mules with 14 points and 7 rebounds, while freshman Spencer Liddic had 11 points, 6 rebounds and 3 blocks. Junior Obi Nwizugbo scored eight points and took a pair of charges.

McKeon has a better than 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio and is the Mules’ leading rebounder this season.


Oh the weather outside was frightful  and inside the play wasnt much better.

The Muhlenberg womens basketball team overcame a sloppy start to score 49 points in the second half and complete a season sweep of Gettysburg with a delightful 69-56 win on a snowy Saturday.

The win, combined with other results, left the Mules (9-2, 6-0) and Washington (8-1, 3-1) as the only two teams with fewer than two losses in the Centennial Conference.

The two teams combined for more turnovers (20) than field goals (15) in the first half, which ended with Muhlenberg clinging to a 20-17 lead. That quickly went away when the Bullets (6-6, 3-2) hit two three-pointers in the first minute of the second half.

Gettysburgs lead was still three points two minutes later before the Mules finally came alive, going on a 22-4 run to open up a 46-31 advantage with just under nine minutes to play.

Senior Lauren Boyle started the surge with a jumper and ended it with a three-point play. Sophomore Sheila Cook scored eight of her season-high 14 points in the run.

One sequence in the run started with the Mules up 34-31. Freshman Alexandra Chili hit a three-pointer, then grabbed a defensive rebound, dribbled away from pressure and made a great pass to Boyle, who in turn fed junior Alexis Bates under the basket for a layup. The five points in 19 seconds extended a three-point lead to eight.

Chili scored 14 of her team-leading 16 points in the second half, and Boyle finished with 12 points. Sophomore Kelly McKeon played an outstanding game, with 13 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists and no turnovers in 39 minutes.

The Mules shot 51.9 percent from the field and 90.5 percent from the line in the second half.

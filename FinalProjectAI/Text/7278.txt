Men's Basketball Wins by 40 in Scotty Wood Opener
 Friday, November 15, 2013 - page 2







					 






The veteran team looked like the veteran team and the new team looked like the new team when the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team faced Bryn Athyn in the first round of the Scotty Wood Tournament.



The Mules shot over 50 percent from the field in spoiling the Lions’ first varsity game ever with a 95-55 win. For the ninth time in the last 10 years, Muhlenberg advanced to the Scotty
Wood championship game, where it will meet Gwynedd Mercy, a 76-73 winner against Hunter.



Sophomore Alec Stavetski, making his first career start, connected on his first five shots and finished with a game-high 24 points, just a point off his career high.
Senior Kevin Hargrove had 19 points and 11 rebounds for his 13th career double-double, and junior Malique Killing added 16 points to move to within 21 of 1,000 for his career.

Playing with a roster of eight freshmen, one sophomore and one junior, Bryn Athyn showed its mettle, staying close past the midway point of the first half. The Lions cut what had been
an 11-point lead to four, at 29-25 with just over seven minutes left in the half, before the Mules went on a 9-0 to re-establish a double-digit lead, which they would hold for the rest of the
game. Killing (right) capped the run with a pair of layups, one off a steal.

Ahead 44-31 at halftime, Muhlenberg shot 54.3 percent in the second half while holding the Lions to eight field goals. A 19-2 run that started midway through the half included a couple of highlight dunks,
one when Killing dribbled through the defense and zipped a pass to Hargrove for the flush and the other coming from freshman John Hunter after senior Austin Curry
broke the Bryn Athyn press.

Hunter (6 points, 5 rebounds) and fellow freshman Jon Schreer (8 points, 3 assists) played significant quality minutes in their collegiate debuts. All 11 players on the roster
scored points for the Mules, including junior Jesse Lerner, who hit a crowd-pleasing three-pointer to close out the scoring.

Muhlenberg took excellent care of the ball, committing only seven turnovers – four of which came on offensive fouls.

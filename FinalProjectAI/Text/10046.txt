Why choose Muhlenberg College for Jewish studies?
Muhlenberg College is one of only a few liberal arts institutions in the United States to offer a major and minor in the field of Jewish studies.
Our approach to the study of Jewish experience is inherently interdisciplinary. Students have an opportunity to explore the history, literature, languages, traditions, and cultures that have comprised Jewish civilization from its Ancient Near Eastern origins to the present day. Our majors and minors work with faculty from across the campus who are committed to an interdisciplinary approach to the field.
Our program stresses the diversity within and among Jewish communities, the interaction between Jewish cultures and those of the surrounding world, and the dynamism that characterizes the historical development of both modern and pre-modern Judaism.
Students are introduced to crucial debates within the field of Jewish studies, and to the critical study of classical and contemporary Jewish texts. 
The Muhlenberg Jewish studies program gives our majors and minors the chance to pursue their degrees with a vibrant cohort of fellow students who share their interest and enthusiasm for the field. Above all, they are challenged to grow as readers, thinkers, and writers, and learn to develop and pursue their own intellectual interests through both thoughtful teaching and opportunities for independent research.

warm weather, but cool bats, for baseball


On an unseasonably mild day, the Muhlenberg baseball dropped the first of a three-game series with St. John Fisher, 10-3.

The Mules (3-12-1) managed only five hits, two by freshman Max Litvak, and trailed 5-0 before they had their first baserunner. St. John Fisher (6-4),
which lost by one run to the eventual national runner-up in an NCAA regional final last year, pounded out 16 hits, including a double, three triples and two home runs.

Sophomore Jimmy Aramanda hit his first career home run for Muhlenberg in the bottom of the eighth.

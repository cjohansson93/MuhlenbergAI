Sophomore Daniel Cano set a personal best by more than three feet in the indoor shot put to lead several outstanding performances by the Muhlenberg track and field teams at Lehigh’s John Covert Classic.

Cano’s throw of 43-2¼ landed him 10th on the school’s all-time performance list and shattered his previous best of 40-1¼. He finished second in his flight and ninth overall in a field of 30 entrants.

Senior Stephanie Carnevale turned in the lone ECAC-qualifying performance for the Mules, who won 15 places in a meet that included three Division I schools. Carnevale posted a third-place finish in the 60-meter hurdles.


In addition to Cano (right), three other Mules cracked the top-10 lists. Junior Josh Elkan was second in the 1000 meters with the seventh-best time in Muhlenberg history. Classmate Cody Geyer finished fourth in the 60 meters with the fifth-best time on the performance list, and sophomore Francesca Aldrich is now fifth all-time in the 60 meters after finishing in 8.41 seconds.

Muhlenberg’s 4x800-meter relay team of senior Jarrett Felix, Elkan, sophomore Forrest Kentwell and junior Kieran Newcomb took second place.

Three members of the Muhlenberg wrestling team combined to go 3-3 in a Centennial Conference trimatch at Gettysburg with New York University. 
Due to forfeits, the Mules lost to NYU, 46-4, and Gettysburg, 42-8.

Freshman Jaryd Flank was impressive in sweeping his two matches at 125 to improve his season record to 13-5. He recorded a 15-2 major decision 
against NYU and a technical fall against Gettysburg, building a 17-0 lead midway through the second period.

Freshman Nate Spilka (left) achieved a milestone at 157 in the Gettysburg match, recording his first career win with an 8-4 decision.

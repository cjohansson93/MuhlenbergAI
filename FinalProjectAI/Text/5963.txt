Women's Soccer Battles Scranton to Scoreless Draw
 Tuesday, October 4, 2011 - page 2







					 




Neither Muhlenberg nor Scranton could find the back of the net, playing to a scoreless tie in a non-conference women’s soccer game.

The draw puts the Mules’ record at 4-5-2. Scranton (6-1-3) is ranked fifth in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. Muhlenberg 
has now tied the teams ranked fourth and fifth in the region, while losing to the seventh-ranked team (Dickinson) in the final minute of regulation. 

Senior Michele Toher kept the Royals, who owned a 16-5 advantage in shots, off the board by making 10 saves. With 2:37 left
in regulation, Toher made a diving save to turn away a shot that appeared to be headed for the corner of the goal. She again denied Scranton with another diving
save early in the first overtime.

With 17 career shutouts, Toher (left) now ranks third in team history.

wrestlers streak into championships


The Muhlenberg wrestling team finished out its dual-meet season on a high note, sweeping Washington and Lee (26-13) and McDaniel (27-20) in a pair of Centennial Conference matches at McDaniel, the site of next week’s CC Championships.

The Mules won their last four dual matches of the regular season to finish at 6-6 overall, 4-3 in the CC.

Seniors Rob Kein (149) and Matt Horn (184) both went 2-0 on the day to end up a perfect 7-0 in the CC. Both wrestlers won by major decision against Washington and Lee and by fall 

against McDaniel. Kein will enter the CC Championships with a 19-2 record, while Horn is 26-2, incuding an unblemished 19-0 mark at 184.

Freshman 141-pounder Kevin Homan (right) and senior 174-pounder Justin Fitch also won both of their bouts.

In the Washington and Lee match, Muhlenberg again used its strength at the upper weight to come back for a win. The Mules were down 13-7 after six bouts before Fitch’s decision and Horn’s major gave them a 14-13 lead. 

Sophomore Bill Sholly clinched the win at 197 by pinning his opponent midway through the third period. It was the third meeting between the two wrestlers, and Sholly won all three, the first two by 5-0 decisions.

At heavyweight, freshman Nick Pallotta also faced a rematch. Four weeks after dropping a 6-1 decision to his opponent, Pallotta pinned him.

The lower weights did their part in the McDaniel match, with sophomore Ryan Hoffman scoring his first career win in a contest bout to get the Mules off to a good start at 125. Pins by Kein and senior Billy Hall and a decision by Homan gave Muhlenberg a commanding 18-0 lead after four bouts.

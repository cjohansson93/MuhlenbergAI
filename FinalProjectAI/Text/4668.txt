three qualify for track nationals


Three members of the Muhlenberg indoor track and field teams were selected to participate in the NCAA Division III Championships, scheduled for this Friday and 



Saturday at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana.

All are repeat national 
championship qualifiers. For the women, seniors Alex Faust (pole vault) and Jennifer Lynch (mile) are going in their events for the second year in a row. Last year they were the first two Mule females to qualify for the NCAAs indoors. 

The lone male qualifier is junior Bobby Torphy in the 800. He competed in the NCAA Championships in indoor track last year, earning All-America honors as part of the distance medley relay team, and in cross country this fall.

Faust, an All-American in the pole vault at the 2009 outdoor championships, tied for the fifth-best vault in Division III. Lynch ranks 11th among the 13 entrants in the mile, and Torphy is 11th out of 12 in the 800.

Lynch will compete first, with the trials in the mile scheduled for 4:20 on Friday. The men’s 800 is slated for a 5:45 starting gun on Friday, and the women’s pole vault is at 10:00 on Saturday.

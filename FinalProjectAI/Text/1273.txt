MTH-382 Special Topic: Complex Variables The square root of -1, often denoted as i, is an interesting number. It is called, perhaps derisively, an âimaginary number,â and yet its presence leads to many mathematically beautiful results (arguably more beautiful and natural than their real counterparts). In this course, we will explore the algebraic properties of so-called complex numbers (i.e. numbers of the form x + iy where x and y are real numbers), differentiable functions of a complex variable and their properties, extensions of exponential and trigonometric functions to the complex variable and the relationships between such functions, and some classic results such as the maximum-modulus principle, Liouvilleâs Theorem, residue calculus, and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Prerequisite: MTH 240 Transition to Abstract Mathematics
MTH-385 Special Topic: Chaos and Fractals Study of chaotic dynamical systems and fractal geometry. Topics from discrete dynamical systems theory include iteration, orbits, graphical analysis, fixed and periodic points, bifurcations, symbolic dynamics, Sarkovski's theorem, and the Schwarzian derivative. Topics from fractal geometry include fractal, Hausdorff, and topological dimension, Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Prerequisite: MTH 240 Transition to Abstract Mathematics, MTH 223 Calculus III, MTH 226 Linear Algebra, or MTH 227 Differential Equations
MTH-387 Special Topic: Number Theory This course covers the classical topics of elementary number theory. We will study divisibility of integers, modular arithmetic, quadratic reciprocity, continued fractions, Diophantine equations, and basic theory of elliptic curves. There will be a strong emphasis on computational number theory. Prerequisite: MTH 240 Transition to Abstract Mathematics, or permission of instructor
MTH-388 Special Topic: 'The Matrix Revisited' This course is a follow-up course to MTH 226, Linear Algebra focusing on applications, particularly involving large data sets. The course is structured to emphasize ~mathematics in action~ and will have many project-based components. Topics include image and sound compression and manipulation, least squares, non-symmetric Eigenvalue problems, symmetric Eigenvalues and singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, and iterative methods. These are all techniques/topics used in applied business, science, and industry. Prerequisite: MTH 226 Linear Algebra

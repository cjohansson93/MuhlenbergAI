Muhlenberg Collegeâs Institute of Public Opinion director and professor of political science Chris Borick works with a student.
Dozens of Muhlenberg students are the engine behind the surveys the Collegeâs Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) conducts. MCIPO director Chris Borick is a professor of political science and a nationally recognized public opinion researcher who has conducted more than 300 large-scale public opinion surveys over the past two decades.  
The April and May Pennsylvania 2018 Midterm Election Surveys Borick and the student team released have drawn a great deal of national media attention. Experts consider the state's midterm congressional elections polling numbers to be a bellwether for the results of the nation.  
A new CNN article calls MCIPO a âgold standard pollster.â
Recent national media coverage includes:CNN: Pennsylvania drowned Democratic hopes in 2016, but 2018 looks far differentCNN: Why the Electoral Battlefield is ExpandingAssociated Press: Wagner as governor spurs questions of business conflictsCNBC: A new Pennsylvania Poll is Filled with Bad News for RepublicansCNBC: Trump aims to help an early ally take down a well-funded Senate Democrat in swing state PennsylvaniaBloomberg News: Conor Lamb Win Energizes Labor Unionsâ Approach to MidtermsNPR: Pa. poll reinforces theory of Democratsâ 2018 wavePhiladelphia Inquirer: Pa. Dem congressional candidate is 'Trumpish' on immigration. Will the party stop him?Philadelphia Inquirer: Pa. gerrymandering's surprise co-conspirators: DemocratsThe Atlantic: Why Stormy Daniels Poses a Problem for Democrats
In addition, a series of national climate and energy-related surveys the Instituteâs student team did in conjunction with the University of Michiganâs Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy have received coverage this spring in national outlets including Daily Kos, Vox, Grist, EcoWatch, EnvironmentGuru.com and GreenWire, plus several international news outlets.
According to FiveThirtyEight, the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg predicted 91 percent of races correctly. The Institute earned an A in FiveThirtyEightâs most recent 2016 Pollster Ratings.
The polling center collaborates with Muhlenbergâs public health program and its psychology department to ensure unbiasedness and survey accuracy. In order to provide research that meets the high standards of the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), all institute personnelâthat is, the student workersâare trained to follow standard scientific practices. The facility is equipped with a computer-aided telephone interviewing system plus data entry and analysis capabilities. Surveys are conducted over the phone using randomized data to generate phone numbers.

Junior Shelby Doll scored her first career goal 5:34 into overtime to give the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team a 1-0 win against
Gwynedd-Mercy.

The goal ended a weekend of frustration around the net for the Mules (2-2-1). On Saturday, they lost 1-0 to Delaware Valley despite an 8-4 advantage in shots.
The Aggies scored the lone goal on a breakaway early in the second half.

On Sunday, the play was even more in Muhlenberg’s favor. The Mules had a 15-3 edge in shots through regulation but could not find the back of the net. 
Their scoreless streak was at 290 minutes before Doll (right and above middle, celebrating with her teammates) scored off the dribble, sending a left-footed 
shot past the goalie.

Freshman Francesca Cobuzzi made a pair of saves to earn the shutout and win in her second career start.

Doll, senior back Maggie Neary and freshman midfielder Taylor Pini were named to the Griffin Classic all-tournament team.

Men fall on extended road trip: The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team spent more time than planned in New York due to the scheduled Saturday
game at Ithaca getting postponed to Sunday. The Mules extended their stay but not their win streak, suffering their first loss of the season, 1-0. The Bombers (2-1-1) scored the
lone goal on a long shot in the seventh minute and held on.

Certosimo Reaches Milestone as Women's Lax Bounces Back
 Wednesday, March 26, 2014 - page 2







					 






Sophomore Brigid Noone scored her second goal of the season and added an assist.





A trip to Albright made things all right for the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team.

Four days after suffering a 17-6 loss to fourth-ranked Franklin & Marshall in their Centennial Conference opener, the Mules bounced back quite nicely,
jumping out to an 8-0 lead in the first nine minutes and cruising to a 17-5 win at Albright.

Senior Michelle Certosimo tied a career high with nine points on three goals and six assists, including the 100th of her career. 
Junior Stephanie Umbach (four goals), junior Kayleigh Thies and sophomore Casey Armstrong (three apiece) also
recorded hat tricks.

Muhlenberg (6-2) completed the non-conference portion of its schedule with six wins, its most since 2008.

Five different players scored the first five goals for the Mules, and when the Lions (5-5) finally scored their first goal, Muhlenberg roared back by scoring
three times in a span of 32 seconds to extend the lead to 11-1 late in the first half.

Armstrong assisted on the last two of those goals and made it three assists in a row later in the half. In the second half, Certosimo assisted on back-to-back-to-back
goals. The middle assist, which completed Umbach’s eighth hat trick in as many games this season, was career helper No. 100. She is the 15th player in
CC history to reach the century mark.

Sophomore Kiersten Mulvey and freshman Sara Allison combined to make 11 saves while allowing only five goals. Senior
Kaitlyn McCaffrey picked up four ground balls while sophomore Arielle Sherman, making her first start of the season,
scooped up three.

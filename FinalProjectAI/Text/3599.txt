 Men's soccer honors

cold shooting plagues women’s basketball


In many games the story for the Muhlenberg womens basketball team is Chilis shooting. In this one, it was chilly shooting.

The Mules shot just 30 percent at 



DeSales in their final non-conference game of the season. The Bulldogs were barely better, at 30.9 percent, but that slight difference was enough to give them a 60-57 overtime win.

Muhlenberg (9-2) led the whole way, by as many as nine points, in a first half that featured 25 turnovers. The teams combined to turn the ball over only nine times the rest of the game but made only 17 field goals.

DeSales (7-6) finally drew even at 35-35 a little more than three minutes into the second half. Muhlenberg went on an 8-0 run to open up a 47-41 lead with 6:22 left but did not hit another field goal the rest of regulation.

The Bulldogs led 52-49 when Mule junior Alexandra Chili was fouled while attempting a three-pointer with 32.2 seconds left. She made all three free throws to knot the score, and Muhlenberg forced DeSales to take a rushed jumper with the shot clock winding down on the next possession.

The Mules drought from the field continued into overtime. DeSales scored the first four points of the extra period, and Muhlenberg could manage only one free throw until senior Kelly McKeon drove the lane, drew a defender and dished of to freshman Leeann Lanza for a layup that made it 56-55 with 1:08 left. 

Muhlenberg again played good defense, forcing the Bulldogs to use most of the shot clock, but this time a three-pointer went in with 37.2 seconds showing, making it a two-possession game.

Junior Kathleen Naddaffs putback with 27.5 seconds left brought the Mules within two. DeSales missed two free throws with 17.0 on the clock, giving Muhlenberg a chance to tie, but McKeons layup danced around the rim before falling into the hands of a Bulldog player. 

Muhlenberg had one final chance after DeSales made just one of two free throws, but a shot from halfcourt hit the backboard and bounced away.

Chili led the Mules with 12 points and also pulled down 10 rebounds, tying a career high. McKeon finished with 8 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists, and sophomore Alita Zabrecky scored 11 points.

Lanza (above) had 10 points, 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots.

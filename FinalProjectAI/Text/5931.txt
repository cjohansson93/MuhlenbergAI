Men's Tennis Beats Rain, Shuts Out Berks

With ominous clouds overhead, the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team rushed to finish its match against Penn State Berks.

Singles matches were played as 10-game prosets and prematch warmups were shortened in an attempt to beat the rain. The play of the Mules also helped,
as they breezed to a 9-0 shutout in a match that ended with a few sprinkles falling.

Muhlenberg lost only six games in the nine matches and scored shutouts at the bottom two doubles and bottom three singles positions. Sophomore 
Ben Berkowitz contributed to two of the shutouts, at second doubles and fourth singles.

Senior Robert Buesser (left) teamed with freshman Corey Galembo for an 8-0 win at third doubles, and freshman
David Alper posted a 10-0 win at No. 6 singles in his first match for the Mules.

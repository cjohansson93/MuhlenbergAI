A chemistry major and business administration minor, Garrison is the first Academic All-American in Muhlenberg volleyball history. The defensive specialist led the 19-9 Mules with 352 digs, a total that ranked ninth in the Centennial Conference. Garrison also tied for third on the team with 28 aces and added 54 assists from the back row.
After three seasons, she ranks 15th in program history with 905 career digs.
Off the court, Garrison has made the Dean's List every semester at Muhlenberg and is a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and a facilitator for Step UP! Mules, a bystander intervention program aimed at educating students to be leaders in helping others. She worked as a full-time chemistry intern at Pixelligent Technologies, a nanotechnology company in Baltimore, Md., last summer.

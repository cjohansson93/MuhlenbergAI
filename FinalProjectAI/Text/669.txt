Background:
Dr. Mathews's areas of interest include gender and American political development, political behavior, institutions, and the scholarship of teaching and learning in political science. She is particularly interested in understanding how, when, and with what consequence relationships between citizens and political institutions change over time.  A current project examines the post World War II internationalization of interests in the United States.
Dr. Mathews is also an active research in the Lehigh Valley Research Consortium, a position from which she has completed several community research projects on public health, older adults, and the needs of people with disabilities living in the Lehigh Valley.
In the classroom, Dr. Mathews has recently developed a new first year seminar focusing on American electoral politics in which she and her students publish weekly on blogspot. In each of her classes, Dr. Mathews has been experimenting with the value social media may add to learning about government and politics.

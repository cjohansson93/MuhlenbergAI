Women's Basketball Posts Healthy Win at Ursinus
 Wednesday, January 23, 2013 - page 2







					 


A case of food poisoning caused Alita Zabrecky to miss practice on Tuesday. But on Wednesday, it was she and her Muhlenberg women’s basketball teammates who put on a “sick” first-half performance in a 67-48 win at Ursinus.




Junior Colleen Caldwell drove in for a layup to give the Mules a 23-8 lead late in the first half.



The Mules (11-6, 8-4) led 19-4 after 10 minutes and, except for a brief scare early in the second half, breezed to their second straight win.

Junior Leeann Lanza recorded her first double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 rebounds to go along with four blocked shots, and Zabrecky had to feel better after netting a team-high 14 points. She also had to feel good about the way her team played at the start.

“We came out, set good screens and executed just like we do in practice,” said Zabrecky, who added six rebounds and four steals. “We were really working together as a team.”

It showed in the stats. In the first five minutes, Muhlenberg made five field goals, one by each of the starters – the first time this season that had happened.




Sophomore Nicole Pepe scored all seven of her points in the second half. She also tied a career high with three assists.



Zabrecky helped get the scoring started by finding senior Kate Clawson for a layup after she was double-teamed in the corner on the first possession of the game. After Zabrecky came off a high screen to nail a jumper from the elbow, Lanza converted a pass into the post from sophomore Hannah Rush to make it 6-0.

On the next possession, senior Julie Kelly came off a screen to drain a three-pointer for a 9-0 lead. The Bears (8-9, 5-7) finally scored their first basket 4:14 into the game, but Rush responded by driving down the center of the lane for a layup.

While the Mules were getting balanced scoring at one end, they were keeping Ursinus from doing much at the other end. The Bears made only four of their first 31 field-goal attempts and trailed 29-10 before making two buckets in the last minute of the half to close to within 31-17.

Ursinus then opened the second half on a 7-0 run, and suddenly the lead was down to seven. 

“We just had to relax and keep doing the stuff that got us the lead in the first place,” said Zabrecky. “We had to get back to executing.”

In that they were successful, avoiding a repeat of their last two games at Ursinus, nailbiters decided by five and two points. The key stretch was a 10-0 run, started by a Zabrecky jumper and also featuring two Lanza putbacks and a fullcourt layup by Rush that spun all around the rim before falling in, which gave Muhlenberg a commanding 49-28 lead with 10 minutes to go.

The offensive execution enabled the Mules to shoot 43.8 percent from the field, snapping a three-game road losing streak in which they struggled to make shots.

“I think we’re on the uphill now,” said Zabrecky. “We might hit a bump in the road, but we’re getting back to where we need to be.”

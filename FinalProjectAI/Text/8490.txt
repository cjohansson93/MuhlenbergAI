Have something to say about what it means to be a member of Muhlenberg's diverse community? If so, we want to talk to you! Every spring and summer, the Sedehi Diversity Project ensemble conducts private interviews with Muhlenberg students, faculty and staff members. The identities of the interviewees are kept confidential, but the words they speak are woven into the annual Sedehi Diversity Project documentary play performed during Orientation Weekend. If you're interested in being added to the interview list, let us know by submitting your info below. Your identity will not be shared with anyone but the Sedehi Diversity Project faculty and students.

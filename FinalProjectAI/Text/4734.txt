softball splits on senior day


If you were scripting it for a movie, the wind at Cedarcreek Field wouldn’t have been blowing in so hard from left, and maybe that drive by Jenna Van Waalwijk leading off the bottom of the seventh wouldn’t have been hit so high.

But little has gone to script this year for the Muhlenberg softball team. Van Waalwijk’s ball, which came 



Hopkins Flexes Muscles in Baseball Sweep


The Johns Hopkins baseball team, ranked in the top five in two Division III polls, jumped on top with a three-run homer in the first game and a grand slam in the second
and went on to sweep Muhlenberg, 9-1 and 13-6.

The Blue Jays (30-3, 16-0) extended their winning streak to 23 and clinched home field for the Centennial Conference playoffs with the sweep. The Mules (14-16, 8-8)
dropped into fifth place in the CC, a game behind Washington (9-7) and a half-game ahead of Franklin & Marshall (7-8), which plays a makeup game against Haverford on
Sunday. Muhlenberg hosts Washington in next Saturday’s regular-season finale and will need a sweep to have any chance of making the CC playoffs.

Junior Joseph DiCecilia went 4-for-4 in the second game.

with the game tied 7-7 and sounded promising off the bat, got caught up in the wind and became a routine out in medium left field. McDaniel went on to score twice in the top of the eighth to win, 9-7, and gain a split of the doubleheader. The Mules won the first game, 2-1.

The lone Muhlenberg senior, Van Waalwijk was honored before

the games, and “JENNA!” was written in chalk behind second base where “MULES” normally is.

The exclamation point in 
the first game belonged to the pitchers, especially Mule junior Ashley Brewer, who threw a four-hitter. After giving up a run on two hits and two walks in the first inning, Brewer was dynamite! in the middle innings, facing only two batters over the minimum without allowing a hit in the second through the sixth.

The Green Terror put two runners on base with infield hits in the top of the seventh, but Brewer got the final out on a popup to short left to end the game.

Brewer also led off the bottom of the first with a double and scored the tying run on a one-out single by junior Jess Kasza. Sophomore Brittany Blohm came home later in the inning on a passed ball, and that was all the scoring.

The second game was a little different. McDaniel (12-18, 2-8) took advantage of Muhlenberg misplays to open up a 3-0 lead in the top of the first. The Mules (11-16, 6-8) roared back with five runs in the bottom of the second. Van Waalwijk began the rally by reaching on an error and scored a squeeze bunt by sophomore Shelby Smith. The big blow of the inning was a bases-clearing line-drive double over the head of the left fielder by freshman Devon Barber. Kasza capped the outburst with an RBI single. 

Barber made a great running catch in center in the top of the third, and the Mules added another run in the bottom of the inning when junior Alyssa Epstein led off with a double and scored on a wild pitch.

Muhlenberg maintained its 6-3 lead until McDaniel came back with four in the top of the sixth to go back in front. The Mules tied the score on a dropped fly ball in the bottom of the sixth, but the Green Terror plated the winning runs on a double in the eighth. Muhlenberg got the tying runs into scoring position in the last of the eighth, but they got no further.

Barber, Brewer and Blohm all had four hits in the doubleheader.

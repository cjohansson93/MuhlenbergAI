wrestling comes up short



Seeking to defeat Ursinus for the first time since 2002, the Muhlenberg wrestling team nearly came back from a 19-4 deficit but fell short and lost, 22-17, in a Centennial
Conference home match.


Senior Rob Kein (left) recorded the Mules’ lone win in the 

first six bouts, scoring a 16-5 major decision at 149. Kein has won eight in a row and is 19-2 for his
career in CC dual matches.

Senior Justin Fitch (right) started the comeback effort with a 15-2 major decision at 174. At 184, senior Matt Horn picked up his 80th career win, 
running his season record to 22-2 with a hard-fought 4-3 decision.

Down 19-11, the Mules needed a win at 197 to have a chance, but Ursinus clinched the match with a 5-0 decision. Freshman Nick Pallotta wrapped up the match by
pinning his opponent in 25 seconds. All nine of his wins this season are by fall.

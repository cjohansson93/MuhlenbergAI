Three Muhlenberg basketball players were selected to the D3hoops.com All-Mid-Atlantic Region team, and junior Kelly McKeon of the womens team was named Mid-Atlantic player of the year.

McKeon (top center) averaged 7.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.3 steals per game  all tops on the Mules  and scored 13.1 points per game, second on the team. She led the Centennial Conference and currently ranks 11th in Division III in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.02). McKeon ranked in the top 10 in the CC in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals.

The regional award is McKeons third player of the year honor this season. She was also selected CC player of the year and Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball co-player of the year.

Sophomore Alexandra Chili also was an all-region selection, landing on the second team. Chili (top right) led the Mules and was third in the CC in scoring at 17.4 points per game. Her 471 points were the second-most all-time at Muhlenberg, just nine points shy of the school record she set as a freshman.

Chili led the conference in three-pointers per game (2.85) and was sixth in free-throw percentage (.773) and ninth in assists per game (3.07). She is currently 13th in Division III in three-pointers per game.

On the mens side, sophomore Spencer Liddic was a third team selection. Liddic (top left) averaged 15.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game and blocked 35 shots, leading Muhlenberg in all three categories. He led the Centennial Conference in rebounding and currently ranks 20th in Division III in the category.

Liddic also led the league in double-doubles (13) and was second in blocks and seventh in scoring. He was 10th in the CC in field-goal percentage, shooting .497 from the floor.

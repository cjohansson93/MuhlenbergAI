Santagato named player of the week



Junior quarterback 
Eric Santagato of the Muhlenberg football team was named co-offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Santagato threw a career-high four touchdown passes, all in the final 33 minutes, as the Mules overcame a 17-0 deficit to defeat Dickinson, 29-24, and stay alone in first place 
in the CC. Two of his scoring tosses came on fourth down, including the game-winner with 3:27 left. Santagato was 13-of-23 through the air for 160 yards.

The 160 yards pushed Santagato over the 3,000-yard mark for his career. He has thrown for 3,121 yards to rank ninth in team history.

It was the second time earning the CC weekly honor for Santagato, who was cited last year after passing for two touchdowns and rushing for three against Gettysburg.

For the season, Santagato leads the CC in completion percentage (.618) and is second in pass efficiency (145.7). He has passed for 1,390 yards and nine touchdowns
with only four interceptions.

Under Santagato’s guidance, the undefeated Mules lead the Conference in scoring offense, averaging 29.8 points per game.

faust, lynch hit provisional marks at penn



Seniors Alex Faust and Jennifer Lynch of the Muhlenberg women’s outdoor track and field team both hit NCAA provisional qualifying
standards at the Penn Relays.

Faust cleared 12 feet in the pole vault, finishing 14th in a field of 33 competitors, 29 from Division I and four from Division III. The NCAA provisional
mark is 11-7¾. Faust, whose career best outdoors is 12-6¼, will have at least three more chances to improve on her height and move up the
performance list. Coming into the weekend, 12 Division III vaulters had cleared 12 feet.

Lynch (right) had an extraordinary run in the Olympic Development 5,000 meters. Her time of 17:20.90 was a full 14 seconds better than the provisional
standard of 17:35.00 and broke her own school record by 18.1 seconds. Lynch came in 20th in a talented field of 34 runners, some of
whom are contenders to make the 2012 Olympic team. One of only two Division III athletes in the race, she was 13th among 25 collegiate runners.

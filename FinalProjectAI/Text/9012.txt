As historians, we critically examine dominant historical narratives and foreground a diversity of historical perspectives. These approaches are inherent to our craft. Our curriculum underscores the intersections of race, racism, ethnicity, and gender, and we intentionally incorporate the experiences of historically marginalized and excluded populations and individuals. We offer students the opportunity to study a wide variety of sources, themes, time periods, and societies, and we encourage the expression of diverse opinions and worldviews.
For more information about the history profession and its commitment to diversity, please read this Statement on the History of Racist Violence in the United States from the American Historical Association.

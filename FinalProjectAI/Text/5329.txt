women’s basketball seniors make history


In Washington, millions of people watched a historic Presidential inauguration and looked forward to the next four years. A little farther north on the Main Line, a considerably smaller gathering witnessed history of a different sort  history that was made over the last four years.

The Muhlenberg womens basketball team rallied late to defeat Haverford, 56-49. 



Chilis four three-pointers gave her 49 for the season  20 more than anyone else in the CC.




That made this years seniors - Lauren Boyle, Bethany Enterline, Erin 
McSherry and Kaitlin Strumph - the winningest class in program history. With a four-year record of 78-19, the quartet topped last years seniors, and with at least 11 games left to play, they have a chance to put some distance between first and second place.

It means a lot to us, said McSherry. Weve all been together since the start and to have accomplished so much is very exciting.

We wouldnt have this record if it wasnt for all the teammates weve played with, so its a tribute to them too, she added.

With their fifth straight win, the Mules (12-2, 9-0) matched their best Centennial Conference start ever and extended their lead at the halfway point of the CC season to three games, thanks to Dickinsons loss to McDaniel.

Muhlenbergs seniors own eight of their wins against the Fords (2-10, 1-7), and like most of them this one was hard to come by. The teams seesawed back-and-forth all game, with 15 lead changes and eight ties, until the Mules said Yes we can! in the late going.

Down 40-39 with 8:30 left to play, Muhlenberg went on a 13-2 run to open up the biggest lead of the game, a 10-point bulge with a minute left. Freshman Alexandra Chili scored seven of her game-high 20 points in the run, including a pair of three-pointers.

Boyle scored 10 of her 16 points in the second half. McSherry blocked three shots and pulled down seven rebounds.

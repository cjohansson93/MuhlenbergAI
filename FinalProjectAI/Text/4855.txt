cycle, comeback don’t add up to win


Best known for housing the Jack Cust Baseball Academy and Jennie Finch Softball Academy, Diamond Nation in Flemington, N.J., is also a great place to go cycling.

Just ask Joseph DiCecilia, who became the first 



Muhlenberg baseball player in more than a half-century to hit for the cycle in the Mules 13-11 loss to St. John Fisher in the opener of a three-game series.

DiCecilia went 5-for-5 and drove in five runs en route to only the third recorded cycle in Muhlenberg baseball history. The last was by Bill Kern  who went on to play in the Major Leagues  against St. Josephs in 1954.

DiCecilias hits were instrumental in the Mules coming back from an early deficit. The game couldnt have started off worse, as the first three Cardinal batters walked and the fourth hit an opposite-field grand slam.

A two-run homer in the top of the third made it 6-0 before Muhlenberg (5-6) began its comeback. DiCecilias two-out, three-run triple cut the deficit in half, and sophomore Jesse Nusbaum followed with a pop fly that fell in for a double to make it 6-4.

St. John Fisher (6-3) extended its lead to 9-4 with three in the top of the fifth. In the bottom of the inning, DiCecilia belted his second home run of the year, a two-run blast to straightaway center.

It was 11-7 when DiCecilia led off the bottom of the seventh with a single up the middle. He eventually scored on junior Jeff Puklins two-out, two-run single, and senior Dan Fisher followed with an RBI single to bring the Mules within a run.

DiCecilia completed his cycle by doubling off the fence in right-center with one out in the eighth. Nusbaum, the next batter, singled up the middle to drive DiCecilia home with the tying run.

Muhlenbergs comeback from a six-run deficit brought back to mind last years game against St. John Fisher in which the Mules scored seven times in the bottom of the ninth to pull out a miraculous 10-9 win. But there was no happy ending this time, as the Cardinals scored two unearned runs in the top of the ninth, the lead run scoring when a batter was called safe on a close play at first after the Mules had appeared to turn an inning-ending double play.

Puklin and Fisher each had three hits for Muhlenberg.

women’s lacrosse receives votesin national poll


The Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team is having an outstanding year, and it has not gone unnoticed.

For the first time in their 26-year history, the Mules received votes in the national Division III poll.

Muhlenberg was one of four teams listed as receiving votes in the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association/Under Armour Division III top 20 poll released
today. 

The Mules are off to their best start in their history, with an 8-1 record, and have won six in a row to tie a school record. 
They are one of 16 teams in Division III with fewer than two losses. Last week, Muhlenberg posted a 12-10 victory against Dickinson, which has been nationally ranked
most of the season, and a 15-14 overtime win at McDaniel, which owns a win against 18th-ranked Elizabethtown.

Muhlenberg will put its new-found national acclaim to the test tomorrow when it hosts fourth-ranked Franklin & Marshall, the defending national runner-up.


Junior Amanda McGovern leads the Mules with 46 points on 33 goals and 13 assists.

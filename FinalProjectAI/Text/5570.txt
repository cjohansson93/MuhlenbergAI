Record Night for Men’s Lacrosse


It was a night for records when the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team defeated FDU-Florham, 14-8, in the first of three consecutive non-conference home games. 

The win was the seventh of the season for the Mules (7-4), tying the school record set in 2005. It was their fifth consecutive win, breaking the mark of four set twice previously.

Senior Kyle Farris scored a career-high five goals, tying a school record with his sixth hat trick of the season. He now has 28 goals on the year, one short of the school record.

Muhlenberg jumped out to a 5-1 lead after the first quarter, only to have the Devils (2-8) tie the score by scoring four goals in the first 5:46 of the second quarter. Back-to-back goals by Farris got the Mules back on track. Senior Mike Brown and sophomore Sean Delany also scored before the quarter was out, making the score 9-5.

Muhlenberg opened the second half with an extra-man opportunity and quickly converted, as sophomore Paul Munday netted his sixth goal of the season with 23 seconds elapsed to complete the five-goal run.

After FDU cut the lead to 10-7, Farris scored twice in a 49-second span, and the Mules had a five-goal lead again.

Brown finished with a career-high five points on three goals and two assists.

The No. 3 doubles team of freshmen Lindsay Schmidt (left) and Danielle Winston won the final four games of their match to claim an 8-5 victory. With a 10-2 record, the duo is the 10th doubles team in program history to win at least 10 matches in a spring season.



 have at least one more thing on their minds – the Centennial Conference playoffs. 

The Mules claimed a home victory against Franklin & Marshall, 7-2, clinching a return to the CC playoffs after missing them last season.

Muhlenberg (8-4, 7-2) will be the third or fourth seed for the CC playoffs, which will be held next weekend at Johns Hopkins. The seeding will be determined by Friday’s final regular-season finale against Washington.

In defeating the Diplomats for the sixth time in seven years, the Mules swept the doubles and won four of six singles matches. The top three players in the lineup – juniors Jenn Powell and Carly Rotfeld and sophomore Caitie Druker -- all won at both doubles and singles. Druker posted a memorable win at No. 2 singles, winning the first set, 6-2, then falling behind 5-0 in the second before storming back to capture the next seven games.

The Mules, who bounced back from two straight road losses, retained their impeccable home record this season, achieving their fourth straight win on Kern Field Courts.

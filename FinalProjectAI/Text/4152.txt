Venuto Ties for 10th at CC Championships; Men’s Tennis Blanked


Senior Amy Venuto of the Muhlenberg women's golf team tied for 10th place at the Centennial Conference Championships, held at Piney
Branch Golf club in Hampstead, Md.

The first day of the tournament was rained out, leaving the championship as an 18-hole event.

Venuto, the lone Mule to compete, shot a 103 to finish in the top half of the field of 27. It was a career-best placing for Venuto, who was 19th in 2008 and
17th in 2009.

Gettysburg won the championship by two strokes over McDaniel.

A day late was twice as Rice for the Muhlenberg men's track and field team.

Heavy rains forced the postponement of Moravian's Greyhound Invitational from Saturday to Sunday but did not affect the performance of junior sprinter Peter Rice, who broke two school records and hit an NCAA provisional qualifying time.

Rice began his day by finishing fourth in the 400 meters with a time of 48.48, breaking his own school record for the third meet in a row. The mark stood at 49.47 at the start of the outdoor season; Rice has progressively lowered it to 49.28, then 49.14 and now 48.48 in the last three weeks. Rice also passed the NCAA provisional qualifying standard of 48.50 as he attempts to duplicate his indoor bid to the NCAA Championships in the 400.

In the 200 meters, Rice crossed the finish line in 22.10, breaking the three-year-old metric school record of 22.14. The all-time school record of 21.34 (converted from a 220-yard dash) was set on a cinder track way back in 1931.

Due to injuries and prior commitments, many Mules were unable to compete in the rare Sunday meet. The Moravian Invitational is used as the Matte Award contest for track and field, and the Greyhounds defeated the shorthanded Mules in both men and women. That leaves Muhlenberg with a slim 8-7 lead in the Matte Award standings with just one event left - men's golf on Thursday.

Empower Yourself on a Global Scale
The Asian studies program at Muhlenberg College offers students the opportunity for multidisciplinary study of Asia, integrating the perspectives of fields across the humanities, social sciences, and arts. 
Asian countries and cultures play an increasingly influential role both in international affairs and in local North American communities. Through coursework and independent study at Muhlenberg, as well as through direct and active engagement with people and ideas from these regions via co-curricular activities and study abroad experiences, students gain a more nuanced understanding of the contributions of Asian cultures.
The Asian studies minor helps to inform professional endeavors in Asia or with Asian communities in fields such as finance, clinical work, business, and education. The program also empowers all its students with a knowledge about Asia to participate in the widening circles of global dialogue on issues of import to us allâintercultural and interfaith interaction, bilingualism, ethnic diversity, world social media, immigration, international resource management, climate change solutions, bioethics, and building civil society.

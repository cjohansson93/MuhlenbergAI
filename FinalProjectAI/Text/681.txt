Teaching Interests:
I teach courses that bring together my passion for psychology, women & gender studies, mental health, and social justice. These include Psychology of Women, Multicultural Psychology, Inside/Out Prison Exchange, Introduction to Women & Gender Studies, Research Methods, Abnormal Psychology, and Clinical Case Studies. 
My classes are student-centered. I am energized by the process of learning. Most people believe that the professor is the one who holds knowledge. Yet, knowledge is not something to give; it is something that is in flux and in need of critical engagement. In this way, even when a course has the same title or covers the same content, each class takes on its own dynamics. After the semester ends, I am never quite the same, and my hope is that students are transformed too.
I teach because it is a high stakes undertaking. Our individual and collective futures depend on intellectual communities. As learners, we try to question and resist detrimental messages that can be absorbed unnoticed. Without the skills to evaluate, challenge, and reinvent, there is no opportunity for empowerment. Far worse, there is great potential for harm, since so much of the dominant discourse increases fear and anxiety. Together, we work to move away from indoctrination and toward the risky experience of becoming. Through this process, we develop compassion for each other, since we repeatedly uncover that living with freedom and responsibility is complicated and difficult. Ultimately, we know that it is not simply enough to engage in the classroom; we must also continually and impatiently work toward the liberation of each other.
I have been honored with the Paul C. Empie Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, the First Year Advising Award, and the Henry Award for Faculty Member of the Year.

Research Interests
I research in the areas of multicultural psychology, gender ideology, men and masculinity, transgender resiliency, feminist therapy, and trauma. In my research, I explore how social identity factors, such as your gender or race, influence mental health outcomes. I also explore how certain gendered experiences, like becoming a father or experiencing menstruation, can influence your relationships with others.
My undergraduate textbook, Psychology of Women & Gender, was published by W. W. Norton in November 2018. The Association of Women in Psychology honored this work with the 2020 Distinguished Publication Award.

Professional Service
I have served on several national executive boards, including several for the American Psychological Association. In 2018, I was awarded the Sue Rosenberg Zalk Award for Distinguished Service to the Society for the Psychology of Women.  I also co-founded the Institute for Academic Feminist Psychologists, an organization that hosts professional development events for early career scholars. In 2016, I became a Think Tank member for the Inside/Out Prison Exchange Program at SCI-Graterford Prison.  In addition to teaching, I have a private practice, in which I specialize in the treatment of trauma and issues related to gender.

Baseball Doubles Pleasure, Beats Penn State Harrisburg
 Sunday, March 16, 2014







					 




After playing outdoors every day for a week while on Spring Break in Myrtle Beach, then going back indoors to practice upon returning to Allentown, the
Muhlenberg baseball team couldn’t wait to get outside again.

That feeling went double for the Mule hitters.

Four of the first seven batters belted doubles in a four-run first inning, and the Mules held on for a 10-7 win against 2013 NCAA Tournament participant Penn
State Harrisburg.

Junior Jimmy Cody (left) went 3-for-4, stole two bases and drove in a career-high four runs, and senior John Scuderi
knocked in three runs to help make a winner of junior Nick Gies, who pitched the first six innings and allowed only five hits and one earned run.

Junior Kurt Johnson led off the game with a double and came around on Cody’s two-bagger. Scuderi doubled in Cody, and senior Max
Litvak knocked in two more runs with the first of his two doubles.

Cody’s RBI single in the second and a two-run single by Scuderi in the fifth extended the Muhlenberg lead to 7-1. But the Nittany Lions (3-11) plated an
unearned run in the sixth and scored four runs on a pair of home runs in the seventh, making the score 7-6.

The Mules (6-5) responded with three runs in the eighth, highlighted by a two-run single by Cody, to extend its lead to 10-6. Junior Austin Cush
came on in relief in the bottom of the inning and closed out the game with two innings. He did not allow an earned run and finished in style, starting a 1-6-3
double play in the bottom of the ninth before striking out the last hitter looking.

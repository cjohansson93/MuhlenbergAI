men’s soccer dominates again, wins first


The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team created plenty of scoring opportunities in its season opener Tuesday night; the Mules just couldn’t find the back of the net until it was too late.


Not so in game number two.

The Mules pounded Baruch with a barrage of shots – 28 in total – and scored four goals in a decisive 4-2 victory on Friday at Varsity Field, earning them their first win of the season.


“It’s very big to get that

first win,” said senior Samuel Hayden. “Now we just need to get a streak going.”


The Mules first broke through at the 21:36 mark of the first half, when junior Evan Rubin won a loose ball in the box and found senior Eric Miller alone in front. Miller snuck the ball into the top of the net for his first goal of the season.


Neither squad could muster another goal in the first half, but the scoring opened up in the second with five total goals scored.


Rubin kicked things off by finishing a cross from junior Mike Williams at the 58:50 mark. Rubin chested the ball to his right foot and beat Baruch’s all-region goalie to give the Mules a 2-0 lead.


“Rubin played great tonight,” said Hayden. “He worked a lot hustling up and down the outside, and he finished a great goal.” 


Less than four minutes later, junior Tom Reilly found sophomore Cody Antonini for a late goal for the second straight game. 

After a Baruch goal made the score 3-1, a couple of Mules recorded career firsts in ensuring the victory. Sophomore Tim Leischner was denied his first career goal on a diving save, but recovered to find senior Mike Gehrmann wide open in front, giving Gehrmann his first career goal. Leischner’s assist was the first of his young career.


With another dominating performance – but this time one that ended with a crooked number on the scoreboard and a “W” in the standings – the Mules are ready to build on their first win of the season when they take on No. 7 Montclair State tomorrow.


“We’re definitely confident after getting a win,” said Hayden. “Montclair is a good team, so we just need to rest up and get ready for tomorrow.”

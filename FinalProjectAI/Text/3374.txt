Bruckner no-hits Dickinson to cap softball sweep 


The Muhlenberg softball team showed off its killer ABs in its home Centennial Conference doubleheader against Dickinson.

Sophomore pitchers Ashley Brewer and Alyssa Bruckner combined to hold the Red Devils to two hits in a 3-0, 3-0 sweep.

None of those hits came in the second game, as Bruckner threw the Mules’ first no-hitter in 19 years. She walked one and struck out five, including the last two batters of the game with runners on second and third. 

Bruckner (left) allowed only one ball to be hit out of the infield in her gem and did not allow a runner past first base until the seventh inning.

“It’s such a rewarding experience,” said Bruckner. “I’ve had a couple of rough spots the last couple of weeks. We’ve been working on my mental game. Sometimes I think too much when I pitch.”

“She did a great job,” said Brewer, who played center in the second game. “She kept the ball down really well, and our defense made plays.”

Bruckner got all the support she would need in the third, when Muhlenberg plated two runs on singles by Brewer and senior RiRi Ferrigno.

Junior Jenna Van Waalwijk singled in another run in the fourth.

Brewer struck out eight in the opening game. Senior Samantha Crist’s double in the first inning drove in the only three runs of the game.

The Mules have won four in a row to even their record at 10-10 and are 5-1 in the CC through six games for the first time since 2001. The latest two wins came against a Dickinson squad that finished second in the CC a year ago, just a game behind first-place Ursinus.

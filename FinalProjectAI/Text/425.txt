 Mary Cassatt (American, 1844-1926) Nursing, 1890 Drypoint
  A native of Philadelphia, Mary Cassatt spent the majority of her career abroad in the company of the artists of the French Impressionist circle. A close friend of Edgar Degas, Cassatt was instrumental in exposing American audiences to the work of the Impressionists. Cassatt’s interest in the subject of women, children, and the natural bond between them, is captured in her paintings as well as her prints. The drypoint, Nursing, offers a characteristic example of the subject matter and printmaking mastery of Mary Cassatt.

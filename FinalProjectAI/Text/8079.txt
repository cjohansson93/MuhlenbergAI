Cross Country Top Runners Strong at Dickinson
 Sunday, September 21, 2014 - page 2







					 




The top runners on the Muhlenberg cross country teams had a strong day at the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational.

The meet consisted of 4K runs for both genders in addition to the standard distances. The Mules entered at least three runners in each of the four races and finished 11th (men) and 12th (women) in the combined team scores.

The men were ninth in the 8K, led by the strong performances of sophomore Jaryd Flank and senior Luke Munyan. Flank finished 15th out of 233 runners and was ninth among Division III runners. Munyan was 30th.



Senior Zach Lifman also finished in the top third of the race, coming in 72nd.

In the men’s short race, Muhlenberg was led by senior Josh Elkan (left) (88th out of 260) and Kenny Wohl (107th).

For the women, junior Melanie Tramontina placed 25th in a field of 265. Her time of 23:59.79 was about 40 seconds faster than the last time she ran on the course, at the 2012 NCAA Mideast Regional.

Freshman Alex Tendler was 55th in the long race, while two other freshmen, Emily Davidson (37th out of 301) and Kaci Gregory (130th) were the top two Mule finishers in the 4K.

The Muhlenberg teams will return to the same course in November for the regional meet.

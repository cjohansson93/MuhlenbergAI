Men’s Cross Country, Men’s Soccer remain steady in regional polls



The votes are in, and a pair of Mule squads are still sitting pretty.

Despite running in sloppy, muddy conditions at last week's Paul Short Run, the Muhlenberg men's cross country team retained its No. 9 ranking in the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association regional poll.

The Mules' 16th-place finish last Friday kept them in the Mideast rankings with Centennial Conference members Haverford (No. 2), Dickinson (No. 4) and Johns Hopkins (No. 7)   




And fresh off a pair of physical, Centennial Conference road ties, the Muhlenberg men's soccer team climbed one spot to No. 21 in this week's National Soccer Coaches Association Division III national poll. The Mules stayed at No. 19 in the D3soccer.com national poll. 

Muhlenberg also remained third in the NSCAA's Mid-Atlantic rankings, where the Mules were joined by four other Centennial Conference schools, Swarthmore (No. 1), John Hopkins (No. 5), Dickinson (No. 6) and Haverford (No. 9). Muhlenberg's next two non-conference opponents, No. 8 Drew and No. 10 DeSales, were ranked regionally as well.

Two of the Mules' key contributors also made appearances in the national statistical rankings.

Junior forward Cody Antonini, who scored the equalizer in Muhlenberg's 1-1 tie at Dickinson last week, is ranked second in the country in both points per game (2.78) and goals per game (1.22). 

Senior goalkeeper Jason Daniels (right), who was named CC defensive player of the week for his 22 saves last week, checks in at No. 28 in Division III in save percentage (0.881).

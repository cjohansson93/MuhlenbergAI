dicecilia named to all-region team



Junior Joseph DiCecilia of the Muhlenberg baseball team was voted to the Mid-Atlantic All–Region second team by the American Baseball Coaches Association.

DiCecilia put together one of the best offensive seasons in Muhlenberg history, hitting .436 batting average with a team-leading nine home runs and 43 RBI. 
He scored 36 runs and stole nine bases, both second on the team, and had a 1.210 OPS. On Muhlenberg’s all-time single-season lists, he came in second in
total bases (102), tied for second in extra-base hits (20), third in RBI, fifth in batting average and seventh in slugging percentage (.729).

An All-Centennial Conference first-team selection, DiCecilia broke the school record for hits in a season (61). He put together the second-longest hitting streak in 
Mule history - 16 games, just one shy of the record - and posted the program’s first recorded cycle since 1954. 

DiCecilia is the third Muhlenberg player to receive all-region honors, and the second in the last three years. He was the only CC player not from top-ranked Johns Hopkins
named to the first or second teams.

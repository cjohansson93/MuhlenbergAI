David Woods '17
David is a finance and Jewish studies double major and serves as the presidential assistant for the office of public relations. At Muhlenberg, he is a member of the varsity tennis team, a student representative, a member of the business and economics club and a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.
David was born and raised in San Juan, PR, and moved to Philadelphia in 2005, where he lives today.
David is delighted to be the presidential assistant of public relations. As he plans to attend law school in the fall of 2017, David looks forward to expanding his skills in writing and communicating. He hopes to one day own his own real estate law firm and hopes his assistantship will allow him to improve on his skills necessary to run a successful business, such as writing, marketing and communicating with clients.

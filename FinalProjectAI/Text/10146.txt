LAST CHANCE FOR THE 2022 CIARLA YEARBOOK!
Sign up for your senior portrait:

There is no cost to have your senior portrait taken for the yearbook
Every senior who provides a portrait for the yearbook will receive one complimentary copy of the book.

Lauren Studios On-Campus Portrait SessionsSeegers Union, April 11â14
Monday, 4/11âWednesday, 4/13, Room 110
Thursday, 4/14, Room 108
Schedule your appointment:

Go to LaurenStudios.com
Create an account by clicking on the 'Schedule' button.
Check your inbox (and spam folder too) for an email from Lauren Studios. Sign up using your personalized Client ID # OR use school code MULE2022
After your photos are ready, you will select your preferred yearbook portrait using the Lauren Studios site.

 Seniors:

Please wear office attire for your yearbook portrait sitting
You will be able to select your preferred yearbook photo from your photoshoot images
Photo packages are available for purchase
Lauren Studios will supply a black cap & gown in the event you or your family would like to purchase those images. 

While it's preferable to have Lauren Studios take your photo on campus, we will accept other portraits as well. For best results:

Wear office or professional attire
Provide a vertical image (not horizontal) of the head and shoulders only. 
The recommended image size is at least 640x800 pixels and a resolution of 300dpi. (Larger is fine but not smaller!)
Smartphone photos are usually fine but make sure to send the largest image size available.
Select a plain background that is neutral or gray-blue in color.
Set up the shot so you face a light source (like a window) rather than having your back to it. 
Send your portrait to ciarla@muhlenberg.edu by May 1. Please include your Muhlenberg student ID number and your home address. We will send your complimentary copy of the 2022 Ciarla yearbook in the fall.

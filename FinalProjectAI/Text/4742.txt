The Muhlenberg track and field teams split up this weekend, with several distance runners competing at Bucknell on Friday night and the rest of the
team running at Moravian in the Coach P. Open on Saturday.

At Bucknell, senior Jennifer Lynch ran in a special invitational 5,000 meters and broke her own school record, running a 17:39.00.
Sophomore Nicolette Miller established a personal record in the 1,500.

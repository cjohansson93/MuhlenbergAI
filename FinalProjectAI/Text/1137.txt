Projects in Educational Technology
From 1995 to 1999 I served as technology specialist for the Mellon Grant project leading workshops for faculty on the design and development of interactive multimedia courseware for language teaching and learning. I also conducted individual training sessions with faculty and students on story boarding, screen design, and basic principles of courseware development, including content organization, navigation, and pedagogical needs. As a result of this team project, 17 faculty from 5 LVAIC institutions and 6 Muhlenberg students developed 26 interactive multimedia instructional units in 6 languages.  Since 1998, faculty-developed courseware, which has been integrated into the Department's curriculum.   For research findings and implication see my paper in The C.A.L.L. Journal, Fall 2003.
I authored several programs which my students use for the study of Russian:  At the Restaurant  (1995-97) is an interactive, multimedia software for Intermediate Russian. This instructional unit provides for contextualized learning in an authentic environment, including two video episodes filmed at Muhlenberg, as well as practice exercises and quizzes.
A Space Journey (1997-98) is an interactive, multimedia software for Elementary and Intermediate Russian, which includes the following topics: Numbers, Days of the Week, Calendar, Holidays, Metric System, 24 Hour Clock, Directions, and more. Students can practice vocabulary, grammar and culture in a variety of interactive formats, including drag-and-drop activities and animation.
Essential Interrogatives (1998). Translated from Spanish, and adapted for Russian language instruction, including changes in vocabulary, grammar, and screen design. 
By Faculty & Students, for Students & Faculty (1999), a multimedia CD ROM overview of the Mellon Project.

Andrew Ardizzoia serves as Assistant Professor of Music and Director of Composition and Instrumental Studies at Muhlenberg College, where he also leads the Muhlenberg Wind Ensemble.  

Andrew's music, described as âexuberant, rhythmic, and great fun,â as well as âsmart, intriguing, and masterful,â has been performed on four continents by a wide variety of soloists and ensembles. Recent performances have included the premiere of Andrewâs âQuod erat demonstrandumâ¦â by the Iowa State University Wind Ensemble at the CBDNA North Central conference, and his orchestrations of two movements from Debussyâs Suite Bergamasque by the Iowa All-State Honor Orchestra and the Arizona State University Philharmonia.  Andrewâs Etudes and Fugues for solo marimba have been performed by percussionist Matthew Coley in Lucerne, Stuttgart, and on tour across North America.  Other performances include the premieres of his Ritmos Colorados and Stonewall Magnificats for percussion ensemble, and performances of the Songs of Introspection in both Michigan and Connecticut.
During the summer of 2015, Andrew served as composer-in-residence at the Heartland Marimba Festival and Academy.  His works have also been heard at conferences around the world, most recently at the Keiko Abe Lucerne International Marimba Academy (KALIMA), as well as the World Saxophone Congress, the North American Saxophone Alliance, the International Horn Society, and the International Summer Arts Institute.  Recent works may be heard on recordings from the International Arts Educators Forum and the Percussion Ensemble at Fort Lewis College.
Andrewâs works have also been performed at Arizona State University, The Ohio State University, the University of Oregon, both Idyllwild and Interlochen, and at many other colleges, festivals, and museums. His music has been part of art installations, dance programs, and theatrical productions around the Pacific Rim.
Recently completed projects include a new work for the Italian chamber group Trio Najma and for the orchestra at the Loomis Chaffee Academy in Connecticut.
Andrew earned the D.M.A in composition with a cognate in music theory from the Hartt School of the University of Hartford in 2014.  He also holds the M.M. in composition from Arizona State University, and the B.M. in composition from the Conservatory of Music at the University of the Pacific.  His primary teachers have included Stephen Michael GryÄ, Robert Carl, Rodney Rogers, James DeMars, Robert Coburn, and FranÃ§ois Rose.  He has participated in masterclasses with composers Christopher Theofanidis, Jennifer Higdon, Michael Torke, and Jonathan Newman, as well as with conductor Karla Lemon at the Scotia Festival of Music.  He also studied conducting with Henrik Jul Hansen and Eric Hammer. 
He is a member of BMI, the College Music Society, and Pi Kappa Lambda.  His percussion music is published by Heartland Marimba Publications.

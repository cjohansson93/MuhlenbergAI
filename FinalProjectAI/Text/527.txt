Each year, the Career Center's Career Road Trips program takes students to visit companies and network with alumni in a variety of industries.Generous alumni host a group of students at their workplaces for a half day of learning. Hosting requires setting up a few hours of on-site activity. A group visit usually includes interacting with professionals from the organization, expert panels, interactive case studies and more.

Teaching Interests
I teach the general chemistry courses (CHM103/104). I have a profound interest in developing students at the beginning of their college career. I will challenge my students to be the best they can be. There will be some struggling and hardship, but I will always be there to support my students to see them succeed. I provide students with the tools they can use to succeed beyond my course in any discipline.
Other courses of interest include inorganic chemistry and materials science. In inorganic chemistry, I enjoy teaching about symmetry, crystal and ligand field theories, as well as coordination chemistry. All of these concepts are used to explain how molecules form and how different parameters can lead to variations in the structure of a molecule.
My background in nanoscience and solid state chemistry draws on my interest to teach a materials science course. Both topics are widely talked about concepts in this course. I would enjoy incorporating my past and present research into the classroom to illustrate how literary concepts are applied to the real world environment.
 
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research background consists of a variety of disciplines from solid state chemistry, nanoscience, X-ray crystallography and analytical chemistry. My graduate work consisted of the electrostatics of gold nanoparticle assembly mediated with anionic polyoxometalates (POMs). This research has opened the door for nanotechnology and solid state chemistry in new and exciting ways. For example, my investigation included the successful assembly of the POM structure Mo-132 and Au nanoparticles for the first time.
At Muhlenberg, I am working with similar entities using noble metal nanoparticles and various POMs to explore the energy transfer and electrostatic interactions. These studies can be used to explore the optical, redox and catalytic properties of these entities which can be used in applications such as medical imaging, biosensors and in energy conversion devices.

Founded in 2007, Muhlenbergâs Lifetime Giving Society boasts more than 500 members including alumni, parents, friends, foundations, corporations, organizations and churches. It was created to recognize these friends and benefactors who are committed to the same philosophies and ideals as the Society's founders, and to ensure that the highest quality liberal arts education is available for future generations.
The society is comprised of four giving circles, each named for a member of the Muhlenberg family (the threshold for joining the Lifetime Giving Society is $100,000):
The John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg Circle
Honors cumulative lifetime giving of $1,000,000 and above
John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg was commissioned a brigadier general in the Continental Army and wintered at Valley Forge with George Washington. The statue of him on Muhlenberg's campus, affectionately known as General Pete, makes him easily the most recognizable of the three Muhlenberg sons.
The Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg Circle 
Honors cumulative lifetime giving of $500,000 to $999,999
Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg was elected to the Continental Congress is 1779 and subsequently served as the speaker of the first and third U.S. House of Representatives.
The Henry Ernst Muhlenberg Circle
Honors cumulative lifetime giving of $250,000 to $499,999
Henry Ernst Muhlenberg was the youngest of the three Muhlenberg sons. In addition to being a Lutheran minister like his brothers, he was also a self-taught botanist who was personally responsible for the names of 150 species of plants as well as the bog turtle. Henry was the first president of Franklin College (now known as Franklin and Marshall).
The Anna Maria Weiser Muhlenberg Circle 
Honors cumulative lifetime giving of $100,000 to $249,999
Named after the wife of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, the founding circle recognizes the important role Anna Maria played in his life and the lives of his children as well as her contributions to the Muhlenberg family.

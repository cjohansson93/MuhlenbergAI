women’s tennis bounces back


Playing the middle of three matches in three days, the Muhlenberg women’s tennis team rebounded from its loss to Washington by beating Bryn Mawr, 7-2.

The Mules swept the doubles and took four of the six singles matches. Following a tough 9-7 doubles win, senior Carly Rotfeld extended her singles winning streak to 
eight with a much easier 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 3. She has won at least one set at love in her last three matches.

Senior Madeleine Goldfarb (left) and sophomores Sara Sutker and Lindsay Schmidt also picked up a pair of wins apiece.

Muhlenberg enters the last day of the regular season in a three-way tie for second place in the Centennial Conference.

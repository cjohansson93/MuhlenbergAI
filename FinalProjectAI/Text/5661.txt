The clock is ticking away, 7:24 remaining. The Mules are up by four. Michelle Feldman feeds the ball above the foul line to Lauren Boyle, who rises up

and puts it in. The crowd burst into ovations. Boyle has just scored her 1,000th career point for Muhlenberg. Coach Ron Rohn doesn’t hesitate to take a timeout to 
honor the accomplishment of the junior, who quickly gets surrounded by teammates. 

The Wantage, N.J., native reached the millennium milestone during the Mules’ 57-52 home victory against Johns Hopkins. Boyle became only the third Muhlenberg player to 
surpass 1,000 career points as a junior.

Men Fall to Hopkins, But Not in Standings



The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team ran into longtime nemesis Johns Hopkins and was defeated at home, 61-47.

The Mules (10-13, 8-8) trailed by just a point at halftime but scored only 22 points in the second half in falling to the Blue Jays (14-9, 10-6) for the 22nd time in 24 games.

Sophomore Peter Barnes scored a team-high 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting, and classmate Ryan Foster added 13.

For the second straight game, the Mules did not lose any ground in the Centennial Conference standings, as the two teams behind them, Franklin & Marshall and Dickinson, also lost.  Muhlenberg takes a one-game lead for the fifth and final CC playoff spot into the final week of the regular season.

relief to get it over,” said Boyle, who finished with 19 points, six rebounds and a team-leading four assists. “At the beginning, I thought it may 
or may not happen today. All my teammates wanted it me to get it in this game and helped me a lot.”

Prior to the encounter with the Blue Jays (10-12, 8-8), Muhlenberg had played 10 consecutive games decided by 12 points or more, recording eight wins and two losses 
during a month-long 
stretch. Today the Mules (18-5, 13-3), who came home following a four-game road swing, demonstrated that they also know how to close out close games. 

A pair of Johns Hopkins free throws with 3:17 left cut a Mule lead that had been seven a minute earlier to only one, 49-48. Sophomore Alexis Bates hit a clutch 3-pointer
on the next possession, and Boyle’s steal and layup made it 54-48.

The Blue Jays scored the next four points to move within two with 40 seconds remaining. Freshman Kelly McKeon, who was not new to shooting decisive shots from the 
line, went 3-for-4 in the waning seconds to shape out Muhlenberg’s sixth consecutive success.

McKeon scored 13 points and tallied five rebounds and three assists for the Mules, while junior Erin McSherry finished with a team-high 10 rebounds and 
tied a 20-year-old school record with six blocks.

Muhlenberg held its opponent to 26.4-percent shooting but was outrebounded, 54-37.

With the victory, the Mules clinched a Centennial Conference playoff berth and remain in contention for the first seed. Muhlenberg is a game behind Dickinson 
(16-6, 14-2) prior to Wednesday night’s matchup between the best two teams in the league. The game, which will be of crucial importance who will host
the CC playoffs, is slated to start at 7:30 in Memorial Hall.

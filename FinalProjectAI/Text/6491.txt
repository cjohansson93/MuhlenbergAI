Men's Soccer Hangs on To Beat TCNJ
 Wednesday, October 3, 2012 - page 4







					 



Senior Cody Antonini stole the show early, but it was a highlight-reel goal by sophomore Joey Roberts that proved to be the difference as the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team defeated New Jersey, 3-2.

The win got the Mules (6-3) back on the winning track after they suffered back-to-back losses last week. 


Antonini scored twice in the first 21 minutes to stake Muhlenberg to a 2-0 lead. Just 8:57 into the game, he ran onto a ball that deflected off of a TCNJ defender, collected the ball from the left side and placed a low shot past the keeper for an early 1-0 advantage.


He struck again at the 24:13 mark. Senior Nate Squire carried the ball to the end line and delivered a perfect pass to the foot of Antonini, who first-timed a shot for his ninth goal of the season.

The two goals gave Antonini 42 for his career, moving him into fifth place on the Mules’ all-time list. Four of those goals came in a span of about 60 minutes at TCNJ: The last time Muhlenberg played there, in 2010, he scored twice in the second half to single-handedly erase a 2-0 deficit.


With just under five minutes remaining in the half, Muhlenberg stretched its lead to 3-0 on Roberts’ second goal of the season. Sophomore Oliver Katz started the play by sending a cross through the air to the top of the box. Roberts (right) planted, looked over his right shoulder, and hit a side volley into the top-right corner.


The Lions (4-9) made things interesting by scoring twice in the second half, the last with just over 10 minutes remaining, but the Mules held on for the win.

When do I apply?
Students can select the 4+1 program in their initial application to Muhlenberg College or at any time once they have enrolled. During a studentâs junior year, all students will submit a 4+1 plan indicating how they will meet the degree requirements for both degrees which must be approved by the chair of the undergraduate department granting the major and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For questions, contact Dr. David Donnelly, Dean of the Graduate School at daviddonnelly@muhlenberg.edu.
To request information about the 4+1 program, please fill in this form.

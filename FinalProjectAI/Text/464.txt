Michael Ananian: On Looking November 17 – December 11, 2015
Michael Ananian is a figurative, narrative painter. He explores how narrative frameworks and narrative ideas influence each other. Often the main concern in most contemporary narrative painting is how the form of the painting, that is, its narrative framework or structure, conveys the ideas of the story. Michael is equally interested in how the narrative ideas can express and create aesthetically exciting pictorial frameworks. His paintings give equal importance to the specific ideas expressed in narrative form and to the resultant form and visual structure itself.

track to send 6 to nationals



The Muhlenberg track and field team will be sending six athletes to the NCAA Indoor Championships at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., this weekend.  
This is the largest Mule contingent ever for either the indoor or outdoor national track championships.

The men’s distance medley relay of senior Stuart Udis, freshman Peter Rice, sophomore Bobby Torphy and senior David Chorney will represent the 
men’s team, and juniors Alex Faust in the pole vault and Jennifer Lynch in the mile will represent the women’s team.

Faust and Lynch are the first two women in school history to compete in the NCAA Indoor Championships.

Chorney and Udis have previous NCAA experience in cross country. Both were members of the 2006 team that qualified, and Chorney went as an indivudual in both 2007 and 2008.

All three events in which Muhlenberg is scheduled to compete are slated for Friday. In Lynch qualifies for the final in the mile, that would be on Saturday.

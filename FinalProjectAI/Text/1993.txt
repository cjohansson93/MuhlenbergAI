Muhlenberg College Counseling Services joins the rest of the Muhlenberg community in expressing our grief, sorrow and compassion to all those who have been impacted by the racial tragedies that have occurred across our nation.
Higher Education should be a place where students from different races, cultures, experiences, and environments come together to achieve exactly that: a higher education. And yet, institutionalized racism has significantly impacted marginalized students on a far greater scale than has been acknowledged. Racial battle fatigue, consistently prevalent micro-aggressions, and re-traumatization via social media are daily traumas for some Muhlenberg students of color
Institutiaonlized and systemic racism, discrimination, racial disparities, and systemic injustices have historically suppressed academic success and negatively impacted the mental health and emotional wellbeing of marginalized students, specifically Black, Indigenous students of color.
In the aftermath of experiencing, hearing about, or witnessing trauma, it is normal to experience a range of distressing feelings such as shock, fear, sadness, anger, helplessness or guilt.
At Muhlenberg Counseling Services, we recognize that incidents of racism both within our campus community and outside of it can significantly impact the emotional well-being of our community members, particularly people of color. We acknowledge the significant pain that race-related aggression activates and the reality of racial trauma. We understand the ways in which power, privilege, and oppression can inflict hurt onto members of the Muhlenberg community.
We support our community members by creating a safe, affirming, and inclusive environment that embraces diversity and honors the intersecting identities of everyone on our campus.
Counseling Services remains a safe, supportive, and confidential place to seek support and process feelings and reactions.

volleyball receives team academic award 



For the third year in a row, the Muhlenberg volleyball team was honored by the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA), earning the AVCA Team Academic Award for the 2009 season. 

The AVCA Team Academic Award honors volleyball teams at the high school and college level that are successful in the classroom. Nominees include high school or college teams that have a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.30 (on a 4.00 scale) or 4.10 (on a 5.00 scale) during the full academic year (both semesters or all quarters), and include all varsity athletes who competed in volleyball with the institution for any portion of the academic year. 

Muhlenberg had an impressive team GPA of 3.67 for the year, with three team members named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll. The Mules made the grade on the court, too, qualifying for the CC playoffs for the first time in eight years.

A total of 75 Division III schools received the award. Muhlenberg was one of only three schools from the Centennial Conference to be honored.

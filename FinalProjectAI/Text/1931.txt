Businesses survive and thrive because they meet customersâ needs. This fact can be taken for granted, but having a current and in-depth understanding of your customer base is central to business growth. âThe most sophisticated firms are making emotional connection part of a broad strategy that involves every function in the value chain, from product development and marketing to sales and service,â according to Harvard Business Review. 
Muhlenbergâs Organizational Leadership courses teach you how to design business development models based on the resources you have in your organization, without losing sight of the needs of your customers. A recent Forbes article underscores the importance of this skill. âInstead of thinking about all the ways your product is better than your competitorsâ and figuring out how to market it to your customers, it can be far more effective to think about your customersâ problems and understand them deeply before you even start working.â Knowing your audience is key to providing them with products and services that keep them coming back for more.
Engage with Emotion
âThe traditional economic model assumes that everyone is a rational,â said Joshua Meredith, J.D., Adjunct Faculty, Muhlenberg Collegeâs School of Graduate Studies. âWe need to be able to think about the reality of how  make decisions.â Nobel Prize winners and behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler proved that emotions play a major role in the way people make decisions about spending money.
Leaders who succeed in todayâs economy must have a dual focus. âThey have to have one eye on the operations and logistics of running the business while keeping an eye on how their customers may change their spending choices based on whatâs happening in the world around them,â said Meredith.

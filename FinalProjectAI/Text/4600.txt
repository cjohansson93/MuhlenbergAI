The Muhlenberg volleyball team opened the 2010 season by going 1-2 at the Gordon Invitational.

Two Mules, junior Jackie Price and freshman Morgan Duggan, were named to the all-tournament team.

Muhlenberg opened the tournament by coming from behind to beat the host school and give Alexa Keckler a win in her Mule coaching debut. Down two sets to one, the Mules rallied to win the fourth set, 25-19, and then came back again in the fifth, rebounding from a three-point deficit to finish strong and win, 15-7.

Sophomore Jennifer Seeba recorded team highs of 8 kills and 3 blocks while playing only three of the sets. Duggan had 34 assists in her first career match, and senior Caitlin Dombkowski had a career-high 7 kills with only one error.

The Mules were swept by tournament champion North Central and Endicott in their final two matches. Price led the team with 21 total kills in the three matches.

Delaware Valley scored 20 second-quarter points and went on to win, 27-7, spoiling the Muhlenberg football team's home opener under the lights.

The Mules played a solid first quarter against the 10th-ranked Aggies. After Delaware Valley 
returned the opening kickoff to Muhlenberg's 44-yard line, the defense prevented the good field position from turning into points when junior Chris Hartzell knocked down a fourth-down pass.

Muhlenberg took over at its own 25 and drove to the DelVal 25 on the strength 




Vaughn finished with a team-high five catches for 46 yards.




of two first-down catches on third-and-6 by senior Jon Liberty. The Mules remained scoreless, however, when a 42-yard field goal try sailed wide.

The Aggies broke the scoreless tie early in the second quarter, then added a fumble return for a touchdown and an 89-yard drive for a touchdown in the final 30 seconds of the half.

Down 27-0, Muhlenberg averted its first regular-season shutout since 1998 by scoring a touchdown with 1:49 to play. Sophomore Isaiah Vaughn caught consecutive passes for 21 yards to put the ball on the 2, and three plays later sophomore Terrence Dandridge scooted around the right side for the score.

Senior Patrick McDonough led the defense with 14 tackles, and Hartzell added 10. Junior Kenneth Cobb made two tackles for loss, including a sack that forced a fumble.

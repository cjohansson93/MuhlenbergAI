Sholly, Pallottaeach win two


With an already thin lineup reduced because of injuries, the Muhlenberg wrestling team had a tough task against three deep and quality opponents during Saturdays quad meet.

And while the Mules were not able to win a dual match, there were some solid individual performances during Muhlenbergs first action in Memorial Hall this season.  

Senior Bill Sholly (top right) picked up Muhlenbergs lone win in its opening 49-3 loss to Delaware Valley. 

After three total takedowns and four escapes, the bout headed to overtime tied at five. Thats when Sholly avoided a leg shoot and quickly jumped on top of his opponent to earn the winning points 31 seconds into the sudden victory period at 184.

In its next match against York, Muhlenberg actually won four of the six contested bouts. But the Mules four forfeits were too much to overcome as the Spartans claimed a 33-15 victory.

Against the Spartans, sophomore Tommy Gazza scored a takedown with 1:33 remaining in the third period to earn a 5-3 win at 133. 

Then junior John Sternlicht picked up a pair of takedowns late in the first and second periods as he won a 5-2 decision at 165.

Sholly followed that up with his second win of the day. He used a first-period takedown and a second-period escape to earn a 3-1 win.

Finally, junior Nick Pallotta (bottom right) provided a strong finish to the Mules second match of the day.

After giving up an early takedown, Pallotta escaped and then caught his Spartan opponent in a headlock. He quickly rolled him onto his back for a quick pin just 38 seconds into the heavyweight bout.

In the final match against Wilkes, Pallotta controlled his bout from the start and picked up another first-period pin (2:10). It was the Mules lone win in a 43-6 loss to the Colonels and helped Pallotta join Sholly with two wins on the day.

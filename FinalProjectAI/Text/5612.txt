baseball sweeps two from penn state


Senior catcher Danny Asip accomplished a rare baseball feat in the second inning of the first game of Muhlenberg’s doubleheader against Penn State Berks. It deflated the opponents and brought his teammates on the Mule bench to their feet.

And that was before he hit a grand slam.

Asip’s arm and bat propelled Muhlenberg to a 13-5 win against the Nittany Lions in Game 1, and the Mules completed the sweep with a 22-6 Game 2 rout. The 35 runs were

one short of the school record for a doubleheader, set just two weeks ago against Wisconsin Lutheran.

Already down 1-0 to a team it was swept by last year, Muhlenberg (8-7) was in danger of falling farther behind when the first two batters in the top of the second reached base on singles. In a bunt situation, Berks (4-10) tried to surprise the Mules by having the runner on second steal, but Asip threw to shortstop Dan Fisher – covering third on the wheel play – to record the first out of the inning.

Two pitches later, the runner on first tried to steal second, and Asip gunned him down too – his second caught stealing in the same at-bat. The batter wound up striking out, completing the unusual 1-2-3 inning.

The Mules were energized by the turn of events, but it wasn’t until the next inning that they energized the scoreboard, taking advantage of shoddy Penn State fielding to score

nine runs. The Nittany Lions committed six errors in the inning, and Muhlenberg had two runs in and the bases loaded on only one hit (a bad-hop single by senior Joe Carlo when Asip stepped to the plate. On a 3-1 pitch, the team captain hit the ball over the fence in left-center for his first career home run, giving the home team a 6-1 lead.

Junior Edward Risener added a two-run double later in the frame. The Mules led by 13-1 before Penn State scored four unearned runs in the seventh.

Muhlenberg’s offense stayed hot in the second game, tying a school record with 27 hits in reaching the 20-run mark for the third time this season. 

A bases-clearing double by Fisher, who finished the game with five RBI, was the big hit in an eight-run third inning. Junior Christian Conti hit his third home run of the season, a two-run blast in the fourth, and drove in four runs to increase his team-leading total to 25.

Junior John Kalis was 4-for-5 with three runs scored, and freshman Clint Lynch went 3-for-4 and scored four times. Freshman Bobby Spindler had two hits in the third inning and scored four runs in the game.

Although the score was way out of hand, the game produced a memorable moment for both teams in the top of the sixth when Mule senior Paul Faith, making his first appearance of the season, got to pitch against his younger brother, Berks freshman outfielder Dan Faith. Paul retired Dan on a grounder to second and received credit for the win.

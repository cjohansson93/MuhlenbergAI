wrestling sunk by Mariners, Ducks




The Muhlenberg wrestling team continued its Centennial Conference dual season with a pair of matches at Kings Point, N.Y.

With a lineup hit hard by injuries, the Mules were forced to forfeit at least four weight classes in each match. Muhlenberg fell to Stevens, 48-6, and also lost to host Merchant Marine, 53-0.

Junior heavyweight Nick Pallotta (left) captured the Mules' lone win on the day when he needed just 44 seconds to pin his Duck opponent. 

It was Pallottas seventh pin of the season and the 27th of his career, both of which are team highs.

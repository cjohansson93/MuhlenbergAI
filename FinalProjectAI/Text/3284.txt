soccer teams start CC season on right foot



Women Come From Behind


It was a game of firsts for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team — first game of the season following a loss, conference opener and first career goal.

It didn’t take long for the Mules to get back on the winning track after suffering their first loss this past Wednesday to third-ranked Messiah. 
They also kicked off Centennial Conference play in style by defeating McDaniel by a score of 4-2. 

During the first half, the Mules hit the posts and missed just wide, but controlled the play throughout. They outshot McDaniel for the game, 26-3. 
After 45 minutes of play, there was no score, but McDaniel (2-5) came out ready to play in the second and in the first eight minutes of the half scored two goals in a 
span of 2:14. 

Soon thereafter, junior Kasey Hacker scored off a feed from junior Jayne Condon. Two and a half minutes later, Hacker scored again on a free kick that deflected
off the goalie, off the crossbar and in to tie the game at two.

Having already assisted earlier in the half, Condon broke the tie with her first career goal in the 68th minute and the Mules (6-1) never looked back. 
“It took me three years to finally put one on the scoreboard and this was the perfect game ... I was so happy that I could contribute in such an important game,” said Condon. 

Freshman Meghan O’Grady added an insurance score with just over a minute to play.

It was only the third time in program history that the Mules overcame a two-goal second-half deficit to win. According to Condon, there was “no doubt we could come back. 
We’ve come from behind multiple times this year and gotten fired up at the right times.”

Every time Steven Tenenzapf touched the ball, his teammates on the Muhlenberg men’s soccer bench yelled his nickname, “Animal.” And every time he
touched the ball, the Franklin & Marshall players had a tough time keeping up with him.

The speedy senior midfielder drew two fouls that led to goals as the Mules opened Centennial Conference play with a 2-0 shutout of Franklin & Marshall in a matchup of



Sophomore Matthew Cecconi and the rest of the Muhlenberg back line limited the Diplomats to five shots, only one on goal.


two of the three teams that tied for the CC regular-season title last year. The win was the first for the Mules (4-2) against the Diplomats in the regular season since 2003.

For the third straight game, Muhlenberg entered halftime tied despite enjoying the advantage in play. The Mules outshot F&M, 6-2 in the first half.

Muhlenberg finally broke through in the 15th minute of the second half when Tenenzapf drew a foul near midfield. Junior Samuel Hayden took the free kick and left-footed
the ball into the penalty area. Diplomat goalie Zach Zamek came out to challenge for the ball, but senior Brendan Carroll beat him to the ball, and his header had
just enough juice to roll past the goal line.

Just 3:16 later, the Mules doubled their margin. Tenenzapf was grabbed by a defender as he streaked for a ball that was headed for the goal line, giving Muhlenberg
a free kick to the left of the box. Cody Antonini’s kick to the far post was knocked away by F&M, but not cleared. Senior Billy Dalton collected the
ball near the top of the box, on the right side, and sent a diagonal cross back to Antonini. The freshman lofted a shot over Zamek for his second goal in as many games.

The Mules finished the game with advantages of 13-5 in shots and 8-1 in corner kicks.

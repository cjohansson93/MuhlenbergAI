Caroline Hogg â20 outside Madison Square Garden, where she is a summer student associate
The first time Caroline Hogg â20, whoâs from Suffolk, Virginia, set foot in New York City was on The Career Centerâs Career Road Trip last September. The second time, she was moving there for a summer position with the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG).
âWorking in midtown Manhattan has been nothing short of a dream,â says Hogg, a media & communication major with minors in English and film studies. âIâm walking under the Empire State Building every day. I would never have had this opportunity without Muhlenberg.â
During the Road Trip, Hogg met Dan Asip â08, director of premium account service at MSG, who was on one of that dayâs panels. Thatâs when she learned about MSGâs summer student associate program. Hogg stayed in touch: âWe talked on the phone, exchanged emails. He passed on my resume.â She got the position after several rounds of phone interviews.
Sheâs spent her summer working as a group sales student associate at the famous arena. Her day-to-day responsibilities include researching what professional hockey teams elsewhere offer groups in terms of pregame promotions and finding Rangers and Knicks fan clubs on social media, âwhich turned into leads for our full-time reps to call,â Hogg says. 
She was a good fit for the paid, full-time position thanks to her previous work in the group sales department at the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. Long-term, sheâs more interested in nonprofit and marketing partnershipsâand she got to dabble in both as a summer associate at MSG. One of the highlights of Hoggâs experience was a volunteer day she spent at a camp for children with cancer and their families, which is orchestrated through MSGâs Garden of Dreams program. And, she worked with a group of other summer associates to come up with a potential partnership between a hospitality business MSG owns and a high-end fitness chain; they pitched it to a board of MSG executives at the end of last month.
âBeing able to do that with people across multiple departments has been one of the most beneficial parts of this internship,â she says.
As she approaches her senior year, she knows sheâd like to land a job in the same field after graduation. âWith the sports industry, once youâre in, thatâs the easy part. Everyone everywhere knows everybody,â she says. âIf this doesnât turn into a full-time opportunity, there will be others because I was able to intern here at MSG.â

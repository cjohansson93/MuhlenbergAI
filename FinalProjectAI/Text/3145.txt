faust, mules hit ground running




Alex Faust sure knows how to get out of the blocks. For the third year in a row, she set a school record in the Muhlenberg track and field teams’ first meet of the season.

Faust broke the school record in the 55 meters while finishing first at the Kutztown Invitational. Her time of 7.58 seconds eclipsed the previous mark, set in 2005, by three one-hundredths of a second. Faust now owns three indoor school records: the 55, 200 (which she also won at Kutztown) and pole vault.

Faust’s two first-place finishes were among five recorded by the Mules at Kutztown. The meet consisted of five other teams – Albright, Philadelphia Community College and Division II East Stroudsburg, Kutztown and Shippensburg – and, with small fields in most of the distance and field events, was a good opportunity for Muhlenberg’s many newcomers to get their first taste of collegiate competition.

Two of those newcomers landed on the all-time performance lists in their debuts: Jenna Schaffer in the 55 meters (fifth, 7.72) and 200 meters (eighth, 27.85) and 
Marc Brookland in the triple jump (seventh, 40-2).

Sophomore Hannah Mitchell (fifth in the 500 meters) and senior Amanda Martini (tied for eighth in the triple jump) also made the all-time performance list for the women’s team, while sophomores Bobby Torphy (sixth) and Rob Nihen (eighth) both made the men’s performance list in the 1,000 meters.

another ot win for field hockey






Junior Alyssa Sheldon assisted on the first goal, which came off a penalty corner after the first shot was cleared outside the circle.




Overtime goals are more fun, anyway.

After missing a penalty stroke midway through the second half that would have put 
Muhlenberg ahead, sophomore Nicki Notarianni scored just 2:19 into overtime for a 2-1 win against visiting Drew.

The victory was the second in overtime for the Mules (5-2) in the last four days. On Saturday, they needed two overtimes before defeating Washington, 2-1. It’s the first time Muhlenberg has won back-to-back games in overtime since 1997.

Notarianni’s stroke, with the score tied at 1-1 and 18:45 left in the second half, clanged off the left post. “I hooked it a little too hard,” she explained. “I was really angry about missing it, and I wanted to [score] for the team.”

Notarianni not only got mad, she got even. Early in overtime, she took a pass on the right sideline, dribbled about 25 yards, beat her defender and fired a shot that cracked off the board inside the left post for her team-leading fifth goal of the season.

Muhlenberg, playing at home for the first time in 17 days, took a 1-0 lead on a deflection by sophomore Kristen Sabia with 10:07 left in the first half. The Rangers (5-2), who only previous loss was to No. 11 Johns Hopkins, tied the game early in the second half.

Pole Vaulters Get Track and Field Teams Off to Good Start

A gold medal and a silver medal from their top pole vaulters added up to a good start for the Muhlenberg track and field teams at the Centennial Conference Championships.

In the first completed event of the meet, sophomore Erin Saucier captured her second career gold. She won indoors as a freshman before finishing fourth
outdoors last year and indoors this year. 

Saucier (right) cleared 10-11¾ to set a new personal best and win by more than six inches. She is the seventh Mule female – the third pole vaulter – to win
the same event indoors and outdoors at the CC Championships.

Junior Bre Biondi scored two points by coming in seventh, matching her outdoor finish from last year.

For the men, junior Ryan Hellings placed second, tying his career-best finish from the 2011 indoor meet. Freshman Jacob Miller-Sobel
was sixth.

The only other finals on the first day of the three-day meet were in the men’s and women’s 10,000 meters.

Through the first half of the decathlon, senior Michael Baer was in fifth place. Junior Tara Keegan stood fourth in the heptathlon,
just 29 points out of third, with three events to go.

UGLY WIN IS BEAUTIFUL FOR WOMEN’S HOOPS 


If an early play is any indication of how the rest of the game is going to go, none was more foretelling than a layup by senior Kaitlyn O’Malley 57 seconds into the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team’s contest.

O’Malley drove to the basket for a left-handed layup and her attempt hit high off the glass, rolled on the top of the backboard and miraculously fell through the hoop.

“I was mortified,” laughed O’Malley. “Afterwards I turned to [sophomore Alexandra] Chili and was like, 'Ahhh.' The whole team was shocked it went in, but two points is two points.”




O’Malley shot 3-for-4 from the floor and 2-for-2 from the line in an eight-point effort.



And a win is a win, even if, like O’Malley's bucket, it isn’t the prettiest. In a sometimes ugly game that included 38 turnovers - 25 of which Muhlenberg forced - the Mules pulled away in the second half for a 75-53 victory over Haverford. The win kept Muhlenberg in first place in the Centennial Conference by a game. Gettysburg won by two on a late layup to improve to 10-2, and 11-2 McDaniel was idle.

“It was just one of those games,” said O’Malley. “You just try to get through it and play as hard as you can. We did a good job running our stuff and we got a win, so we’re happy.”

The first minute of the game gave the 11th-ranked Mules (14-2, 11-1) plenty to be happy about. O’Malley found junior Sheila Cook for the opening bucket 15 seconds in, and junior Kelly McKeon stole the ensuing outlet pass and went in for an easy layup. O’Malley then responded to Haverford’s first score with her miraculous layup.

A McKeon three-point play gave Muhlenberg its biggest lead of the period at 31-19, but the Fords (5-11, 3-9) climbed back into the game with an 8-1 run capped at the 1:01 mark. 

Still leading by six with the final possession of the half, Muhlenberg missed a jumper, but freshman Alita Zabrecky grabbed the offensive rebound, finished a layup and was fouled with 2.7 seconds to play. Zabrecky completed the three-point play to send the Mules to the break up nine.

“That was a big play, especially going into the half,” said O’Malley. “They went on a run, but getting that play gave us the momentum to put them away in the second half.”

Muhlenberg did just that thanks in part to another fortuitous play and some hot shooting. The Mules led by 11 when, with the shot clock winding down, junior Alexandra Berlin dribbled across the lane and banked in a running jumper as the buzzer sounded.

From there, Chili sealed the game, draining three treys in a three-minute span to give Muhlenberg a 22-point lead with 8:34 remaining.

“Her shots are such a big part of our offense,” said O’Malley. “Once she’s hitting there’s nothing you can do. It’s nice that it came earlier rather than later.”

Chili finished with five threes as part of a 15-point performance. McKeon led the Mules with 16 points and six assists, and freshman Julie Kelly netted a career-high 11 points.

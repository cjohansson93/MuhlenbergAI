SEVEN ALL-CONFERENCE PICKS FOR FOOTBALL
 


Seven members of the Muhlenberg football team were named All-Centennial Conference.

Senior wide receiver Phil Cresta was the lone selection on offense. Cresta was named to the first team for the second straight year, the first Mule wide receiver to accomplish the feat since 2001. He led Muhlenberg with 62 catches, the second-most in a single season in school history, 911 receiving yards, the fifth-highest total, and three touchdowns. He ranked second in the CC in catches and receiving yards per game and in the top 50 in Division III in both categories.




Emmett (8) and McDonough (11) led a defense that allowed a CC-low 15.8 points per game and 256.7 yards per game. Cresta (81) was one of just seven repeat first teamers from a year ago.






Two other Mules received first-team honors. Senior defensive end Frank Emmett reached the first team a year after being named to the second team. Emmett finished third on the team with 51 tackles (4½ for loss) and also broke up three passes. Junior linebacker Patrick McDonough was also a first-team selection. McDonough led the Mules with 80 tackles, the fourth-best mark in the CC.

Junior punter Jason LoPipero was named to the second team. While LoPipero finished the season fifth in the CC with an average of 34.7 yards on punts, he helped the Mules to a CC-best average of 33.1 yards in net punting. He led the conference with 21 punts inside the 20.

Three others, senior defensive end Jake Floyd, junior linebacker Andy Curley and sophomore defensive back Chase Nadell, received honorable mention. Floyd led the Mules with seven sacks and 12½ tackles for loss, both the third highest totals in the CC. Curley was second on the Mules and fourth in the CC with six sacks and added 59 tackles (9 for loss), also second-best on the team. Nadell had one interception and made 33 stops at both safety and cornerback.

Muhlenbergs three first-team selections raised its CC-leading total to 114. Dickinson is second with 111, followed by Franklin & Marshall (102), Johns Hopkins (97), McDaniel (79), Gettysburg (70), Ursinus (66) and conference newcomers Moravian (8) and Juniata (0).

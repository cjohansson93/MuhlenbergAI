The Muhlenberg women’s tennis team was ranked 12th in the Atlantic South Region in the first rankings of the spring season released by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.

In their first match with the new ranking, the Mules lost at undefeated Elizabethtown, which was ranked 20th in the region, 6-3.

Sophomore Emily Szulman was the lone Muhlenberg player to pick up two wins. She teamed with classmate Nina Sanders for an 8-5 win against a Blue Jay No. 1 doubles team that came in undefeated in dual matches for the season.

Szulman also won in straight sets at No. 2 singles. At No. 3 singles, freshman Jennifer Goldberg (left) won a marathon match, coming back after losing the first set to win the third in a tiebreak. Her opponent had been undefeated.

 Dr. Mike Benninghoff â95 has been working around the clock with this team at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, to oversee the treatment of its COVID-19 patients. 
 For the past six weeks, Benninghoff, section chief for critical care, has treated numerous patients in the intensive care unit. Benninghoff, who was a biology and natural science double major at Muhlenberg, relies heavily on evidence-based approaches and the experiences from other medical institutionsâlargely from New Yorkâto help him decide the best course of action to take in his own hospital.
âBy and large, weâve gotten it right,â he says. 
Despite these unprecedented times, Benninghoff says the biggest difference in how he normally practices medicine is a lack of contact with patientsâ familiesâhospitals generally are not allowing loved ones to visit COVID-19 patients. That, and having meetings at all times of the day and night, he says. 
âFrom a leadership standpoint, our care guidelines and workflows are similar,â he says. âWeâve had good outcomes, which is good for morale.â 
The challenge, he says, is not knowing what exactly needs to be done when it comes to treatment and safety protocols, because the evidence and guidance change so frequently. 
âOur goal is to get patients home and healthy, but weâre not dealing with robust evidence to recommend one treatment over another, for example,â Benninghoff says. 
But because guidelines for preventing the transmission of and treating COVID-19 are so in flux, it presents a unique opportunity to call upon the global healthcare network.
âWith listservs and social media blogs, there is so much information. We spend hours every day communicating with providers across the world,â he says. âItâs a neat time to practice [medicine]. Thatâs the most unique thing about this pandemic.â 
Benninghoff acknowledges that life may not return to normal, at least for the foreseeable future, but has faith that if people follow evidence-based guidelines, the virus can be managed.
âI suspect that life will be different for some period of time to come,â he says. âItâs important that we use evidence-based science for decision-making regarding social distancing. Let the epidemiologists, governors, scientists and frontline healthcare workers do their work, and donât rush to open things back up.â

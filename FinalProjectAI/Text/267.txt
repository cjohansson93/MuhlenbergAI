Accreditation
Overview
The Fraternity and Sorority Life Accreditation Process at Muhlenberg College is the measurement of transformation that the social Greek organizations and their members experience on an annual basis. Through quantitative and qualitative data, fraternities and sororities report the impact their respective organization has on their membersâ personal and professional development. Similarly, members of the organizations report the impact they have on other members of the Greek community, their organizations, Muhlenberg College, and our city, Allentown, PA.
As part of the Division of Student Affairs (DOSA), Fraternity and Sorority Life models the Accreditation measurements after four of the divisionâs Key Strategic Initiatives: 1) Health, Safety, and Well-Being, 2) Student Learning and Social Life, 3) Equity and Inclusion, and 4) Residential Experience. Additionally, social Greek organizations are deeply rooted in esoteric and exoteric ideals and principles espoused daily by the members. In addition to DOSAâs Key Strategic Initiatives, fraternities and sororities will be measured on: 5) Value Congruency.
Measurements
Each fraternity and sorority are encouraged to facilitate opportunities that align with their organizational values, Muhlenbergâs Division of Student Affairs Key Initiatives, and measurements of the Accreditation process. Many fraternity and sorority experiences may fall within one or more of the following measurements:
Health, Safety, and Well-Being
This areaâs focus includes but is not limited to Risk Management, New Member Education, Standards Board procedures, Prevention efforts related to alcohol and hazing, etc. Success in this area focuses on education and accountability of all members of the organizations and of the organizations. Fraternities and Sororities should create a culture of bystander intervention, minimization of risks, self-reporting and governance, and establishing a safe and welcoming environment for new members, among others.      
Student Learning and Social Life
This areaâs focus includes but is not limited to Organizational Operations, Financial Management, Scholarship and Academic Achievement, Collaboration within the Greek, Muhlenberg College, and local communities, Brotherhood and Sisterhood programming, and having fun! Success in this area focuses on the day-to-day general operations of the organization, itâs members and leadership. It also includes consistently engaging in and with the communities we are a part of, through collaboration in program planning and offering of support. Fraternities and Sororities should spend time together building relationships with each other, with members of other organizations, and with other organizations recognizing that learning can occur in many different ways.
Equity and Inclusion
This areaâs focus includes but is not limited to Recruitment, New Member Education, Diverse Programming, Philanthropy, Community Engagement, and Overall Polyculturalism. Success in this area focuses on creating an environment that is open and welcoming to all members of the Muhlenberg College community regardless of affiliation to a fraternity or sorority. This culture of acceptance for members should be apparent during the recruitment and new member education programs. Fraternities and sororities should learn about the members of their organization and Muhlenberg College organizations, as well as the Allentown community. Members and organizations should engage in College and local issues, supporting their fellow students and community partners. The fraternity and sorority community should understand that success is likely if there is support for one another and work together rather than focus on competition amongst one another.
Residential Experience
This areaâs focus includes but is not limited to: Management of college-owned or organization owned property (if applicable), Respect of Muhlenberg College facilities, Creative use of space to promote and facilitate a positive fraternity and sorority experience. Success in this area focuses on the day-to-day care shown in housing and college facilities and sees the benefit of the spaces provided. Fraternities and sororities should take pride in their facilities and use it as a tool to enhance the brotherhood or sisterhood and see the facilities as a representation of their organization and their organizationâs values.   
Value Congruency
This areaâs focus includes but is not limited to: Rituals and Ritual Education, (Inter)National Organization relationships and participation, and Values-Driven Programs and Behaviors. Success in this area focuses on the esoteric and exoteric ideals, principles, and values that guide the fraternities and sororities. The values of the fraternities and sororities are a defining characteristic of the organizations and are on exhibit day-to-day through membership selection, member or organizational reputations, and consistent patterns of behaviors. Fraternities and sororities should regularly participate in ritualistic ceremonies as prescribed by the (inter)national organizations and understand the values and meaning associated with the organization and accompanying ceremonies. Members of fraternities and sororities should be able to find positive connections between the organizationâs values and their personal values and be able to describe the positive impact and transformation the values have had on their development.
Annual Reports and Presentations
Annual Reports
Fraternities and Sororities at Muhlenberg College will submit an annual report consisting of organizational highlights from the months of May through April, annually, due on a date determined by the Associate Director for Student Engagement. The format and structure of the annual report is up to the discretion of each organization, as long as it provides a complete and accurate picture of what the academic year was like for the organization, and connects to the measurements of the accreditation process.
Annual reporting and award applications through (inter)national organization offices are strongly encouraged. To limit complications and repetition of information sharing between Muhlenberg College and (Inter)National Organizations, annual reports and award applications for Fraternity and Sorority Headquarters are acceptable forms of the annual reports. Supplemental materials to enhance these documents to further connect to Muhlenberg Collegeâs accreditation process are also acceptable.
Presentations
In April of each academic year, fraternities and sororities will share their experiences from the academic year to the Accreditation Committee (faculty, staff, and students) through a presentation as a complement to their annual report. The presentation should highlight the measurements of Muhlenbergâs accreditation process, highlighting the Division of Student Affairs Key Initiatives and Values Congruency. The format of the presentation is up to the discretion of each organization. The College community and organization alumni will be invited to attend the presentations. Dates and times will be determined by the Associate Director for Student Engagement. Chapters should prepare to be available for at least 60 minutes; 40 minutes for the presentation with 20 minutes for questions. Chapter presidents and/or appointed member of the organization should community with the Associate Director for Student Engagement to arrange room and technology needs.
Overall Rating and Feedback
Chapters will receive a rating of unacceptable, did not meet expectations, met expectations, or exceeds expectations as recommended by the Accreditation Committee. Considerations for overall rating include the written annual report, presentation and questions, improvements of the organization from the previous year, conduct records, and proven year-long commitment to excellence.
With the overall rating, chapters will receive feedback about their performance over the academic year. This will include areas of improvement within each of the areas of membership.

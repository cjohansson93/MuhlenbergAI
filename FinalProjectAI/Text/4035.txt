Rice Breaks Record Again


Peter Rice's broken record is becoming a broken record.

For the second straight meet, the junior on the Muhlenberg track and field team broke his own school record in the 400 meters, running 49.14 at Moravian's Coach P Open. Rice clocked in at 49.28 last week and is inching toward the NCAA provisional qualifying time of 48.50.

Rice's record dash highlighted a good day for the Mules in a very competitive meet. The teams had 28 new or improved Centennial Conference-qualifying performances and eight new marks for the all-time top 10 list.

Sophomore Brendan Smith ran the second-fastest 10,000 meters in team history, while sophomore Samantha Mayden (third in the 1,500) and freshman Stephanie Carnevale (fourth in the 100 high hurdles) also landed in the top five on the performance list.

One streak had to end when the Muhlenberg men's tennis team hosted McDaniel for its Senior Day match. And it was the one the Mules wanted to end.

Muhlenberg came in having lost seven straight since its season-opening win against Penn State Berks. And McDaniel took the courts with 27 consecutive losses to the Mules.

Make it 28. Muhlenberg won 7-2 for its first Centennial Conference victory of the season.

Robbie Goldwein (left), one of the Mules' three seniors, was a winner at both doubles and singles, taking his No. 2 singles match 6-1, 6-2.

Another senior, Jason Kirschenbaum, came back after losing his first set at No. 6 singles to win in the final match on the court. The third senior, Wayne Mitchel, made his return to the lineup at No. 3 doubles after missing the first half of the season with an injury.

Freshmen Jason Teitelbaum and Ben Berkowitz joined Goldwein as double winners, with Berkowitz posting a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at No. 5 singles.

The Muhlenberg women also extended their streak against McDaniel, beating the Green Terror for the 12th year in a row. Half of those 12 wins came via 9-0 sweeps, including this one.

In the seven contested matches, the Mules lost only four games. Senior Sara Sutker, taking a turn at No. 1 singles, recorded a 6-0, 6-0 win, as did freshman Lauren Zakheim at No. 4 and sophomore Amanda von Taube at No. 5.

Gelah Penn: High TideOctober 8 â January 10, 2018

Detail from studio.Reception 10.18 5-6:30pmArtist Talk 12.6 5â6pm in the Recital Hall
Gelah Penn's High Tide is a site-responsive installation in which the artist deploys a variety of synthetic materials to "invade, interpret and confound" the architectural parameters of the Philip Johnson-designed Baker Center for the Arts at Muhlenberg College. Penn will transform the skybridge using plastic garbage bags, foam rubber, Mylar, acrylic paint, mosquito netting, polyester, foiled thermal insulation and other materials to expand the language of drawing to this unique three-dimensional space.
Gelah Pennâs recent solo and group exhibitions include the Amelie A. Wallace Gallery/SUNY Old Westbury (Old Westbury, NY); National Academy Museum, Lori Bookstein Fine Art, Foley Gallery, Equity Gallery (New York, NY); San Francisco Art Institute (San Francisco, CA); Weatherspoon Art Museum (Greensboro, NC); Bibliotheque Municipale Louis Nucera (Nice, France); and Carl Berg Projects (Los Angeles, CA). Her work is in the collections of the Weatherspoon Art Museum (Greensboro, NC), Columbus Museum (Columbus, GA), Brooklyn Museum Library (Brooklyn, NY) and Gund Library/Cleveland Institute of Art (Cleveland, OH). Reviews have been published in Art in America, The New York Times, artcritical.com, The Brooklyn Rail and a feature in Sculpture magazine. Penn has received a Tree of Life Individual Artist Grant and fellowships from the Marie Walsh Sharpe Foundation, Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony. Her work will be included in "Materiality: The Matter of Matter" at the Center for Maine Contemporary Art (Rockland, ME) in November 2017.

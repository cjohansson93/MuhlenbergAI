The Education Department aims to educate dedicated classroom teachers whose values include reflective practice and a belief that all children deserve a quality education. The democratic and social justice mission of public education is perhaps no more important than in this historical period as we continue to look to our public schools for equity in life opportunities and common values in an increasingly plural and fragmented society.
The faculty and staff of the Education Department are excellent teachers, scholars and mentors to our students. We all value the privilege of shaping teachers who will in turn play vital roles in the lives and futures of their students. Once students graduate from Muhlenberg College and our program we believe they are ready to meet modern educationâs challenges.

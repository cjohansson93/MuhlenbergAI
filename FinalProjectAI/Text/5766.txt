deluca honored by cc again


For the second time in three weeks, junior running back John DeLuca of the Muhlenberg College football team was named co-offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

DeLuca rushed for a career-high 188 yards and two touchdowns in the Mules’ 31-0 win at Franklin & Marshall. It was his fourth consecutive 100-yard game and his fifth of the season. 

DeLuca gained 106 yards on 14 carries in the first quarter alone, including a 16-yard run to give Muhlenberg a first-and-goal, a 5-yard touchdown run two plays later, and a 37-yard sprint (right) on the first play of the Mules’ second touchdown drive. He added a 27-yard TD in the third quarter.

For the year, DeLuca is second in the CC with 908 yards and needs 92 more to post the seventh 1,000-yard season in program history. He also is the second-leading touchdown scorer in the CC with 10 trips to the end zone.

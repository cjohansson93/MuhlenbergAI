muhlenberg to send 3 to x-c nationals


The Muhlenberg cross country teams will send three runners to the NCAA Division III Championships on Saturday.

Juniors David Chorney and Timothy Van Syckle of the 
men’s team and senior Sara Gearin of the women’s team will make the trip to Northfield, Minn., to compete in the national meet hosted by St. Olaf College. The women’s race is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. Central time, followed by the men’s race at noon Central time.


In order to be eligible to participate in 


the championships, teams and individuals must qualify in their respective NCAA regions. Thirty-two teams were selected to participate in each championship. The top two teams automatically qualified from each of the eight regions, for a total of 16 teams.  Sixteen additional teams were selected at-large.

Fifty-six individuals, the first seven athletes from each region who are not a part of a qualifying team, were selected to participate in each championship. 
 
Chorney knew he had qualified immediately after the Mideast Regional, hosted by Muhlenberg last Saturday, but Van Syckle and Gearin had to wait until the NCAA announced its at-large selections.

Chorney and Van Syckle will both be making their second appearance at the NCAA Championships, as they were in last year's top seven on the team that earned a bid.
They are the first cross country runners in school history to run in the NCAA meet twice. 

Muhlenberg has had athletes qualify to compete in the NCAA Championships five out of the last seven years, but this is the first time the school has been represented by both genders in the same year.

Of Muhlenberg’s seven fall sports teams, four earned spots in the NCAA Championships.

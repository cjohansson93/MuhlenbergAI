cresta named player of the week


Junior Phil Cresta of the Muhlenberg football team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.







Cresta caught a career-high eight 
passes for 128 yards and two touchdowns as the Mules knocked off Gettysburg, 42-21. His scoring receptions covered 33 and 35 yards in the fourth quarter to put the game away.

Cresta also set up Muhlenberg’s third touchdown with consecutive catches of 12 and 21 yards to the 1-yard line.

For the season, Cresta has 20 receptions for 355 yards and four touchdowns. He leads the CC in receiving yards per game (118.3) and receiving touchdowns and is second in catches per game.

The 128 yards vs. Gettysburg pushed Cresta’s career total to 1,094, making him the 17th player in team history to amass 1,000 receiving yards.

The weekly CC honor is the second for Cresta, but the first in football. He was named CC pitcher of the week in baseball in the spring.

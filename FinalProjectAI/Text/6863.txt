Senior John Muha broke the Muhlenberg baseball record for hits in a season in a 9-3 loss at Moravian in a game added to the schedule last week.

Muha (left) singled past the third baseman on the first pitch of the game for his 62nd hit of the season, breaking the mark of 61 set by Joseph DiCecilia in 2010.
Muha later added another single, pushing his career total to 187, just one short of the school record. He has two of the threee highest single-season hit totals in program history.

The Mules (17-17) had only four other hits in the game, including an RBI triple by sophomore Jimmy Cody. (official scoring changed 4/23)
 
Sophomore Danny Usewick had two hits and scored two runs.

Conrad W. Raker Biological Field Station and Wildlife Sanctuary



The Conrad W. Raker Biological Field Station and Wildlife Sanctuary, a 40-acre wooded tract situated 15 miles north of the campus, in Germansville, PA, is used by biology classes for field study. A section of Jordan Creek within the preserve provides added opportunity for aquatic biology studies. Students and staff also conduct research on varied aspects of plant and animal biology. Because the preserve is not generally open to the public, those interested in visiting should contact the Biology Department.

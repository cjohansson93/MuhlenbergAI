Men's Tennis Win Caps Day of Matte Award Contests
 Thursday, April 10, 2014







					 



Muhlenberg won the first Matte Award contest of the 2013-14 year (a men’s soccer game back on September 11) and the last, but not enough in between.

The final day of Matte competition of the year featured three head-to-head contests with Moravian. Although the Mules won a thrilling men’s tennis
match, the Greyhounds swept in softball and won the baseball game, 4-3. Moravian finished with a 10-6 margin to win its first outright Matte Award in 11 years.


In men’s tennis, Muhlenberg came back from a 2-1 deficit after doubles to win, 6-3, in a match that ended close to 9:00. After junior No. 1 Daniel Lakhman and sophomore No. 6
Derrick Eng bookended the singles lineup with straight-set wins, senior Ben Berkowitz outlasted his opponent, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3,
at No. 3, to give the Mules a 4-2 lead.

Three matches remained on the court, all in third sets. Moravian won at No. 4 and broke serve down 6-5 at No. 5 to remain alive. But senior Jason
Teitelbaum finally clinched the match by winning his third set at No. 2, 6-3. Freshman David Woods (left) closed out the match by handily
winning his tiebreak, 7-1.

Berkowitz and Eng teamed up for an 8-2 win at No. 3 doubles.

Baseball put a major scare into the Greyhounds, who are receiving votes in both Division III polls, but two prime scoring chances 
came up short in the late innings.

Muhlenberg trailed 4-1 after five innings before pulling to within one in the top of the eighth. The Mules (11-12) had the tying run on third and the 
go-ahead run on second with one out, but Moravian (20-5) was able to get out of the jam.

The Mules mounted another rally in their last at-bat, again putting the tying run on third with only one out. With the infield in, the Greyhound shortstop 
made a diving stop on a sharply hit grounder for the second out, and another groundout ended Muhlenberg’s comeback hopes. 

Junior Jimmy Cody had two hits and scored two runs for the Mules, and senior Tyler Latrenta went 
2-for-3 with a stolen base and a sacrifice.

Playing a doubleheader for the second straight day, softball was swept at home by Moravian, 5-1 in the first game and 2-1 in the second. 

In the opening game, junior Alyssa Schell doubled on the first pitch of the game and later singled in a run. The Mules (17-7) got the tying run
to the plate with nobody out in the bottom of the seventh, but a double play and a flyout ended the threat and the game.

Junior Heather Porrini had a strong effort in the nightcap, throwing a six-hitter against a Greyhound team that came in ranked in the top
10 in Division III with a near .400 team batting average. A home run in the fourth broke a 1-1 tie and proved to be the difference.

Muhlenberg scored its lone run in the third on a single by sophomore Taylor Trifiolis, who went 3-for-3. The Mules got only one runner
into scoring position the rest of the game, however.

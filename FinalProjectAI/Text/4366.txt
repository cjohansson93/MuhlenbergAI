women’s basketball gets forfeit win,clinches spot in playoffs





Junior Katy Rossino dished out a team-high 4 assists in Tuesday's win against Dickinson. She is one of five Mules with at least 40 assists this season and leads the CC in assist-to-turnover ratio.


Without ever having to board the bus for its game at Bryn Mawr, the Muhlenberg women's basketball team clinched a berth in the CC playoffs for the sixth straight year.

The Mules' game with the Owls was canceled due to an illness that has affected 

the Bryn Mawr team, and with the end of the regular season just 10 days away the game will not be rescheduled. 

Since an official forfeit cannot be declared until all participating teams are present at the gym, the game is considered a "no contest."

After discussions with both schools, the Centennial Conference declared the game a forfeit win for Muhlenberg for conference-standings purposes only. The Mules' record remains 16-5 overall and goes to 13-4 in the conference with the addition of the forfeit win.

And while the Mule women spent their night off watching the men's game, they received some help from their CC foes. 

Both Washington and Franklin & Marshall lost, creating a three-way tie in the loss column for fifth place between Swarthmore (9-8), Franklin & Marshall (9-8) and Washington (8-8).

With four CC losses and only three games to play, the worst Muhlenberg can finish is in a tie for fourth place, which means the Mules clinched one of five conference tournament spots.
Muhlenberg can secure a spot in the tournament semifinals with a win at McDaniel on Saturday.

The Mules have won a record five CC tournament titles and have advanced to the final nine times. Muhlenberg has captured three out of the last five championships and has appeared in three consecutive title games.

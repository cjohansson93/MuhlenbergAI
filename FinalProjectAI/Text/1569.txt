Jim Ferris will read from his prize winning book of poetry, The Hospital Poems, and will also share some new material in a reading on March 2, 2005 at 8:00 p.m. in the Recital Hall, Baker Center for the Arts at Muhlenberg College. This event is free and open to the public. The Hospital Poems has been described as "a stunning collection that keeps you spellbound," and as "humane testimony to the power of our imagination to make sense of affliction."  The book was selected as the winner of the 2004 Main Street Rag Poetry Book Award. A former newspaper reporter and television producer, Ferris has won awards for both his writing and his teaching. He currently teaches disability studies and communication arts at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and is active in the Society for Disability Studies.

Men's Soccer Suffers Damaging Loss to Dickinson

Volleyball Falls in Three at Moravian

 
In its next-to-last match of the season, the Muhlenberg volleyball team returned to the place where it started the year – Moravian. As they were in the Greyhound
Premiere Invitational, the Mules were defeated by the Greyhounds, this time in three sets.

Moravian (24-5) is ranked sixth in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the NCAA.

Freshman Sarah Weyhmuller led the Mules (16-11) offensively with 10 kills in only 19 attempts. It was her fourth time reaching double digits in kills.

Freshman Joanne Josephson had six kills and three blocks.

The playoff hopes of the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team took a hit with a 2-0 home loss to Dickinson.

The setback, combined with Johns Hopkins’ 1-0 win at McDaniel, dropped the Mules (10-5, 4-4) into sixth place in the Centennial Conference, a point behind
Hopkins. In order to make the five-team field for the CC playoffs, Muhlenberg must hope for a Hopkins loss or draw at Washington on Saturday. If the Blue Jays tie,
the Mules would need a win at Ursinus to earn a playoff berth, and if Hopkins loses, Muhlenberg gets in with a win or a tie.

Dickinson (11-3-2, 6-1-1), ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the NCAA, scored the opening goal with 11:14 left in the first half and extended its lead to
two shortly after halftime.

Muhlenberg pushed hard to score in the final 20 minutes and had some good chances on headers, but they all went wide. It was the first time since 2006 that the Mules
lost a CC game at home by more than one goal.

All five of Muhlenberg’s losses are to regionally ranked teams. In addition to Dickinson, Swarthmore (third), Haverford (sixth) and Franklin & Marshall (eighth)
are ranked in the Mid-Atlantic, while Ithaca in ninth in the East Region.

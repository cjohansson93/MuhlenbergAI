The Muhlenberg College Department of Theatre and Dance presents “Moving Stories,” a dance concert showcasing the new works of advanced student choreographers, Nov. 18-20 in the College’s Baker Theatre in the Trexler Pavilion for Theatre and Dance.
Under the artistic direction of Sarah Carlson, lecturer in dance at Muhlenberg, junior and senior dance majors and minors will premiere original works that represent issues that are important to each choreographer. Each dance presents a unique movement statement, displaying a wide array of movement styles and ideas. The concert represents the culmination of a semester-long choreographic process.
“‘Moving Stories’ is a physical embodiment of the questions that are on the minds of the student body,” Carlson says. “Each dance presents another vibrant way of understanding these questions, prompting further inquiry, and an experience of these issues on a kinetic, visceral level.”
The student choreographers draw deeply from personal life experiences in creating their pieces — as well as from their diverse liberal arts education — finding inspiration from a wide range of disciplines.
“Many of the pieces are tackling how our world is changing and how we connect as a society,” Carlson says. “The choreographers are using their pieces as a means of presenting these questions and prompting the audience to come to a new understanding of these issues.”
 “Moving Stories” reflects the unique dynamic of the Muhlenberg College dance program, among the highest-ranked programs of its kind in the country. The Fiske Guide to Colleges names both the theater and dance programs among the top 20 small college programs in the United States; Muhlenberg is one of only eight colleges to be listed for both theater and dance.
Most of the pieces are in the modern dance style, but Jeremy Arnold ’12 is one of the few students ever to choreograph a tap piece for “Moving Stories.”
“I am thrilled to have some incredible feet at my disposal here,” Arnold says.  “I am excited about this piece because the outlet for tap in the real world is relatively limited, and exposing people to my choreographic process, improvisation, and performance experience will be thrilling for me and hopefully will make for a great piece.”
Senior Katie Fierro ’11 uses sound effects and voice-overs to enhance her piece, “A Beautiful Passing,” about her grandfather’s battle with Parkinson’s disease.  AlexJo Natale ’12 and her trio of dancers explore schizophrenia through a childhood fantasy world.
In her piece “Face to Face(book),” Ashley Sleeth ’11 explores the changing dynamics in dating that have occurred because of Facebook. Sioned Papparotto ’12 works with 1950s gender stereotypes, using a ’50s television commercial as the soundtrack.
 “Moving Stories” also showcases the works of Brittani Maglio ’11, Christine Pepin ’12, Lynn Lisella ’11, Krista Bacchieri ’12, Maggie Griffin ’11, and Jeanette Meibach ’11. 
“Moving Stories” performances are Thursday and Friday, Nov. 18-19, at 8 p.m., and Saturday, Nov. 20, at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for youth. Performances are in the Baker Theatre, Trexler Pavilion for Theatre and Dance, Muhlenberg College, 2400 Chew Street, Allentown.
Call 484-664-3333, Monday through Friday 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. for ticket reservations, or online at www.muhlenberg.edu/tickets. For more information about the dance program at Muhlenberg College, visit www.muhlenberg.edu/dance.

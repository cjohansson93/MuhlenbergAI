 Michelle Marano Navigating The Color Line: Bursting the Bethpage BubbleUnlike any other project I have done over the years at Muhlenberg, this project challenged me to connect course readings from my Race and Representation class to my own personal experiences of living in a multicultural society. This autobiographical essay forced me to examine the role that racism has played throughout my lifetime. In addition, it forced me to think about, work through, and overcome many of the preconceived notions and distorted views that I had about people of other races and ethnicities that I never knew existed. From another standpoint, this paper gave me a better understanding of the impact racism has on all those that encounter it. Writing this paper not only helped me explore and question my position on the color line, but other peoples as well.

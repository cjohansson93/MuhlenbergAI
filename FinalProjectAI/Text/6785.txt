Hellings Wins Second Gold of Year at CC Meet

The Muhlenberg track and field teams vaulted into the 2013 Centennial Conference Championships with strong performances from their pole vaulters.

Senior Ryan Hellings took first place, clearing 13 feet, 3½ inches to match his indoor gold medal. He is the first member of the men’s team to win the pole vault outdoors at the CC meet since 2003, and the first to win both indoors and outdoors since 2000. Hellings placed at CC championship meets in all eight tries, with two silvers and three bronzes to go along with his two golds as a senior.

In the women’s vault, junior Erin Saucier took a silver medal, and senior Bre Biondi (right) set an outdoor personal best by coming in sixth.

In the only other final on the first day of the meet, freshman Melanie Tramontina posted the fourth-fastest time in the 10,000 meters in program history, coming in ninth.

Junior Scott Reutter won the long jump in the decathlon and was in fourth place after the first half of the event.

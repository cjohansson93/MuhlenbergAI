Men's Soccer Overcomes Late Start, Early Deficit
 Saturday, October 22, 2011 - page 2







					 


When it comes to putting in direct kicks, Nate Squire has been lights out this year.

The junior midfielder scored in the 20th minute to break a 1-1 tie, and his goal stood up as the winner as the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team posted an important 2-1 victory at Gettysburg in a game delayed 40 minutes at the start due to a power outage.

The result kept the Mules (9-4-1, 5-2) in a second-place tie, one point out of first place, with a week to go in the 



Squire has four goals this season, three on free kicks and the other on a penalty kick.



Centennial Conference regular season. Johns Hopkins (5-1-1) beat Swarthmore (4-3) to retain its hold on first place, while Dickinson (5-2) remained in a tie with Muhlenberg by defeating Ursinus.

The teams were warming up for the game when the lights and music on Clark Field suddenly went out. After a few more minutes on the field under the setting sun, both squads returned to their locker rooms.

“We tried to stay as mobile as we could, but it was more just sitting around and wondering when we were going to play,” said Squire. “That was definitely a first for me and I think for anyone else on our team. It was sort of an odd way to start the night.”

The night ended on an odd note too. Gettysburg (6-7-1, 3-3-1) appeared to have scored the 




Barlotta's assist was the second of his career. His first came last year, also on a goal by Way against Gettysburg.



tying goal with 2:39 left, but the goal was disallowed by an offside call. 

“I was pretty mad that we had let that happen, but I hadn’t looked at the linesman yet,” Squire said. “I saw our goalie and backs all looking over there, and they seemed pretty confident we would get the call. I said a few prayers of thanks for the call.”

The ending was set up by a stretch of three goals in a span of less than eight minutes by two teams that came in tied for the CC lead in fewest goals allowed. The Bullets struck first at 11:25 on a header of an endline cross from the left side, but just 3:11 later junior Danny Way headed in Ryan Barlotta’s long service to tie the score.

Squire’s game-winner came on a free kick from just outside the corner of the penalty box, to the goalie’s right, after a Gettysburg player was given a yellow card for a hard foul.

“We talked about doing one of the plays we’ve been working on in practice, but I thought it was in a good spot, so I said, let me go ahead and hit this, and it managed to go in,” said Squire.
 
Although the scoring pace slowed, the intensity did not. Three more yellow cards were assessed, and with 7:47 left one of the Bullets was sent off after bringing Way down from behind on a breakaway.

Despite playing a man down, Gettysburg was able to put itself into position to tie, but scoring game-tying goals against Muhlenberg in the 88th minute is harder than it might appear. The game last Saturday night against Franklin & Marshall had a similar ending, with an apparent late tying goal disallowed by a foul call.

It might be a good omen for the Mules as they close in on a postseason berth.

“Personally, I’d rather we just close it out,” said Squire.

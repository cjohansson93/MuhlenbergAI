Women's Soccer Drops Finale to Ursinus
 Wednesday, November 2, 2011







					 



The standings may have made the game seem meaningless, but to the 16 total seniors on the two teams, there was plenty of importance to the women’s soccer game 
between Muhlenberg and Ursinus.

And after a delay of four days due to a snowstorm, it was the Ursinus seniors who got to close out their careers with a 2-1 win.

The Mules ended the season with a record of 6-10-2, losing each of their last five games by a single goal. The only two teams to beat Muhlenberg by more than a goal during the
season are both ranked in the top five in Division III.

Prior to the game, the Mules honored their five seniors: Nicolette Miller and Meghan O’Grady, who both rank among the top
scorers in team history; Michele Toher, one of the top goalies; Jamie Weiss (right), who came back to be a key contributor after
missing the entire 2010 season with an injury; and Rachel Zarkin, who joined the team for her senior year.

It was a pair of freshmen who were on the front and back end of Muhlenberg’s lone goal. Krissy Fioretti sent a cross into the box that went off a
head and was punched by the Bear goalie. But it was not cleared, and with the goalie out Colleen Touhey shot the loose ball into the net to give the Mules
a 1-0 lead with 32:20 to play. 

Ursinus came back less than a minute later to tie the game on a penalty kick, then scored the winner with 23:40 left.

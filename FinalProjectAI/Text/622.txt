Below are some wonderful resources for exploring careers and finding jobs in science.
There are two job search websites that may be useful to physics majors and minors; www.indeed.com and www.simplyhired.com. Below are some helpful hints to using these websites. Both sites do not require a log in to search jobs, but if you would like to save jobs to look at later you will need a log in.
â www.indeed.com
~ In order to search the entire USA, type United States in the âWhereâ box.
~ In the âWhatâ box you can type in physics but this could get overwhelming. You can add phrases like âentry levelâ or âsummer internshipâ to limit your search results.
~ There is also an advanced search option, which could help limit results. This option can be found under the âFind Jobsâ button.
~ Once you complete a search you can get email updates on new jobs in this category. To do so on the top right of the search page press âGet new jobs for this search by emailâ. To use this feature you must have a log in.
~ If you choose to create a log in you may also post your resume so employers can search you. You can also download an application for either the iPhone or Android.

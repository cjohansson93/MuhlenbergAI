Levine named head men's tennis coach


Bruce Levine has been hired as the new head men's tennis coach at Muhlenberg College. He replaces Jeff Schmitt, who retired following the 2015-16 season.


	 Thursday, September 1, 2016  08:11 AM

"I'm really excited to come to Muhlenberg," said Levine. "I look forward to building on the foundation established by Jeff Schmitt and assisting our student athletes in their pursuit of excellence in the classroom, in our community and on the court."
Levine brings a wealth of knowledge of the game of tennis, along with owning plenty of experience as a coach and mentor. He served as interim women's tennis coach at Vassar College in the spring of 2016, filling in for a coach who was on sabbatical. Vassar went 13-8 last year, including a win against nationally ranked Skidmore, and finished the year ranked 18th in the Northeast Region.

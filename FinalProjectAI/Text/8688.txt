Facilities 
Muhlenbergâs Art DepartÂ­ment is housed in the Baker Center for the Arts, a modernist building designed by internationally acclaimÂ­ed architect Philip Johnson. Built in 1976, this structure, whose dramatic focus is a 220-foot, sky lit galleria, houses the departmentâs studios for painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, darkroom phoÂ­tography, and digital mediaâin addition to an art gallery and classrooms.
Muhlenbergâs location is an ideal setÂ­ting for art majors, providing easy access to the first-class museums and art galleries of New York and Philadelphia. The art department regularly sponsors trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum, and Museum of Modern Art.

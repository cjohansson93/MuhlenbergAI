women’s soccer keeps rolling on


The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team extended its 



Schaefer’s goal was the second of her career. The other came against Washington two years ago.



winning streak to a season-best four games with a 3-1 win at Bryn Mawr.

The victory moved the Mules (9-5, 6-1) into a full-fledged tie with Johns 


Field Hockey Shut Out



The Muhlenberg field hockey team was shut out for just the third time this season, dropping a 1-0 decision at Scranton in its final non-conference game of the year.

Scranton (7-8) scored off a penalty corner late in the first half. The Mules (8-6) had their best scoring chance with three minutes to go in the half, when a shot that was saved by the goalie came to rest in front of the cage before a Royal defender knocked it away.

Kristen Dornenburg, who entered the game ranked second among all Division III freshmen in save percentage, improved on her stat by making eight saves.

Hopkins for first-place in the Centennial Conference. Three other teams (Dickinson, Haverford and Swarthmore) all won to improve to 5-2, setting up an interesting final eight days of the regular season, beginning with Saturday’s games.

Muhlenberg had a 19-7 advantage in shots in beating the Owls (5-9-1, 0-8) for the 16th straight year. Late in the first half, senior Kasey Hacker broke a scoreless tie when she scored from 10 yards out. A clear attempt by the Owls put the ball on the foot of junior Lauren Petri, who passed to Hacker for a shot to the near side of the 
goal.

Senior Christine Schaefer extended the lead to 2-0 when she scored in the 49th minute. Less than three minutes after Bryn Mawr scored off a corner kick to cut the gap to 2-1, sophomore Meghan O’Grady took a pass from freshman Alyssa Meola and beat the goalie to the far side.

The Mules’ final three CC games are on the road against Franklin & Marshall (1-7) and at home against playoff hopefuls Ursinus (4-3-1) and Gettysburg (4-2-1). If they win all three, they will clinch the top seed for the CC playoffs.

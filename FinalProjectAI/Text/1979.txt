Muhlenberg College is now using Mantra Health for all Psychiatric Services.
 
What is Mantra Health?
Muhlenberg partners with Mantra Health as an extension to the Counseling Center to provide psychiatry services. Mantra Health is a telemental health platform that helps connect you to board-certified psychiatry providers to address your specific needs through video and messaging, at your convenience. Your provider will work with you to establish a personalized treatment plan, which may include medication management, lifestyle changes, evidence-based strategies, and tools to track your progress. Throughout treatment, Counseling Center staff can collaborate with the Mantra provider to make sure weâre all on the same page in providing the optimal care for you.
How can I work with Mantra?

Visit your campus counseling center and let us know that youâre interested in working with a Mantra provider. We will help see if Mantra is a good fit for you, and then create your account and send the referral.
Once we refer you, check your email for an invite from Mantra to complete your account set up.
Complete the onboarding tasks in your Patient Portal, which takes about 10 minutes. Be sure to do this before your appointment - this helps your provider focus the time spent with you on discussing your goals and establishing a treatment plan thatâs right for you.
Join your first scheduled appointment with your provider through the Mantra Patient Portal.

Already have an account?
If you already were referred by someone at the counseling center, you can log into your account at app.mantrahealth.com using your Muhlenberg email address.
Questions?
If you have questions, reach out to the Counseling Center. If you are receiving care through Mantra Health, you are able to contact your provider through your Patient Portal or the patient support team at hi@mantrahealth.com or 1-800-464-2083.

Ready for a spin? Visit Muhlenberg's bike share on Chew Street, near the Baker Center for the Arts.
Notice anything new on campus? Thereâs now a fleet of shiny, sturdy cruisersâsporting Muhlenberg logos and bright blue rimsâready for riders. Itâs the Collegeâs Zagster Bike Share program and it will provide both campus and Allentown community members with a convenient, affordable, healthy and environmentally-friendly way to get where they need to go.
Muhlenbergâs bike-share station was recently installed on Chew Street, between Trexler Library and the Baker Center for the Arts. A kickoff celebration included free bike rides, hands-on demos, a map of Allentownâs bike lanes and refreshments and was captured in photos and video by The Morning Call.

Muhlenberg President John Williams, Kalyna Procyk, sustainability coordinator and adjunct professor of political science and sustainability studies, and John Morgan, executive director of the Allentown Parking Authority, welcomed attendees and cut the ribbon to officially launch the new program.
A second bike-share station has been installed at the Allentown Parking Authority, Sixth and Linden Streets, making it easy for users to head downtown to explore the city or ride to Muhlenberg for events.
âPartnering with Allentown Parking Authority through the bike-share program is a wonderful opportunity to strengthen our connections with our neighbors and deepen our commitment to the city,â said Williams. âIn addition, the College has a number of sustainability initiatives in place to reduce our carbon footprint and the new bike share is an important effort as we keep moving towards this goal.â
An initiative of the Collegeâs Office of Sustainability, the bike share is a "fun and convenient way for students, faculty and staff to get around campus as well as explore Allentownâs great parks, restaurants and downtown offerings, all while reducing our environmental impact,â said Procyk. âWeâre excited that anyone in the Allentown community can participate in the program as well.â
Riders, who must be 18 or older, join the program by signing up for an annual membership plan: $15 per year for Muhlenberg students, faculty and staff or $25 per year for all other community members. The annual plan includes two free hours for each ride, with $1 for each additional 30 minutes. An hourly program is also available, at $1 for every 30 minutes of riding. 




 
Zagster bike shares feature an award-winning bike known for its practical design, comfortable ride and easy handling. And because safety is a priority, every bike includes automatic lights, a bell and full reflectors. Riders are encouraged to provide their own helmets.
You can view stations and bikes in the free Zagster app. One tap in the app automatically unlocks the bike, allowing a rider to get rolling in seconds. After the rider returns the bike to a designated Zagster bike station, the rental ends and the bike is available for the next person to enjoy.
A built-in lock on gives users the freedom to ride as long as they want, wherever they want. Unlike traditional bike shares, in which riders must drop off bikes at designated stations for every stop, riders can lock their bike anywhere for mid-trip stops, while beginning and ending their rides at either the Muhlenberg campus or downtown Allentown location.
Muhlenbergâs bike share is supported by President John Williams, Dean of Students Allison Gulati, the Presidentâs Committee on Sustainability and by the efforts of Sustainability Studies students.
Muhlenberg's Office of Campus Sustainability brings together students, faculty and staff with a diversity of perspectives and areas of expertise to seek creative solutions for campus sustainability. Learn more about the program here.
Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Zagster is the leading provider of private and public-private bike-sharing systems in the United States. Learn more about Zagster here.

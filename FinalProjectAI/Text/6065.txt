Homan Wins Weight Class at Ursinus
 Saturday, November 12, 2011 - page 3







					 



Senior Kevin Homan was beaten by no-man, winning the 149-pound weight class at the Ursinus Fall Brawl for his first career tournament win.

Homan swept through his four matches, defeating his first opponent by a 7-0 score and pinning his next two foes, one in just 47 seconds.

The final bout was scoreless in the second period when Homan’s opponent injured his ankle and could not continue. 

It was the second straight outstanding tournament for Homan, who finished third at the Monarch Invitational last weekend. He has won 10 straight bouts, and with a season record of 11-1 has already surpassed his win total of nine from all of last year.

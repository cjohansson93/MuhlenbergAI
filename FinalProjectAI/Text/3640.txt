The Muhlenberg womens basketball team is ranked 18th in the first D3hoops.com poll of the regular season.

Sophomore Alita Zabrecky scored a career-high 19 points to go along with 7 rebounds, 3 assists and
a career-high 5 steals in the win against Gettysburg. She ranks in the top 15 in the Centennial
Conference in scoring (13th), rebounding (tied for eighth), field-goal percentage (ninth), 
assists (tied for fourth), steals (tied for third), offensive rebounds (tied for fifth) and
assist-to-turnover ratio (seventh).




moved into the top 25 after defeating Gettysburg, then ranked No. 16, last Tuesday. The Bullets, who reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament last year, slipped to No. 21.

Muhlenberg is the highest-ranked team from the Mid-Atlantic Region, as teams from the region that were ranked last year  Scranton, Moravian, DeSales, Messiah and Lebanon Valley  all have losses; in fact, all except Lebanon Valley have at least two losses. Remarkably, just two weeks into the season, there are only two undefeated teams in the region: Muhlenberg and 2-0 Baptist Bible.

The Centennial Conference is also represented in the poll by Johns Hopkins, which received 12 votes after a 4-1 start that included a win over Messiah.

In the Womens Basketball Coaches Association poll, Muhlenberg is 20th.

Being ranked in the top 25 is nothing new for the Mules. They have received votes in the national poll during the regular season each of the last six years, with their highest rank during that span coming last year (No. 11). The programs all-time best national ranking is No. 8 in the 2001-02 season.

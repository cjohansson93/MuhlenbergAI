The Muhlenberg Fund Impacts Everything
Whatever you or your student loved most about the Muhlenberg experience â an athletic team, an academic department, a student club â was made possible because of The Muhlenberg Fund. 
Gifts to The Muhlenberg Fund support financial aid, clubs and programs, professors and advisors. 
The quality of the Muhlenberg experience depends on the support of alumni, parents and friends. A lifetime commitment to annual giving is an important component of the Collegeâs ability to achieve increasing prominence. Help to open doors for students by supporting The Muhlenberg Fund today.
When Should I Make My Annual Gift?
The fund year for Muhlenberg College runs from July 1 - June 30. All gifts in a given fund year must be received by June 30.
Make a gift now.
For more information, contact Louis Diez, executive director of annual giving.

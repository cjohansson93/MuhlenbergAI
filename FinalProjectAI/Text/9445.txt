Erika Davis '16 came to Muhlenberg on a prehealth track, imagining that sheâd continue on to eventually become a physical therapist. And while she worked toward that goal, she intended to take advantage of the Collegeâs many opportunities to dance, a passion sheâd had since she was 2 years old. âI wanted to continue that training,â she says. âIt makes me happy and gets me out of my head.â
But she also was open to discovering new things: âMuhlenberg allowed me to find all the avenues on campus that I might have an interest in, and then focus on those that I might want to do in my future. Through all of the courses, I found what I was passionate about, and that led me forward to today.â
After taking her first economics and business courses, âa light bulb went off in my head,â she says. âI never thought it'd be something I'd excel in.â By her second year at Muhlenberg, sheâd declared a major in business administration.
So she sought and found opportunities to research and study different aspects of business. Working as a research assistant, she helped Associate Professor of Business Roland Kushner put together reports for the nonprofit Americans for the Arts. âThat tied together my passions for business and arts administration and arts in general,â says Davis, whose course of study included double concentrations in management and arts administration.

Today she's the CEO of Regional Dance America, a national nonprofit organization that helps to provide growth and networking opportunities for pre-professional dance companies and their dancers, choreographers and artistic directors. âI work with a group of wonderful directors to set policy and implement any initiatives the board determines,â she says.
Davis credits Muhlenberg for helping her become the leader she is today. â[Associate Professor of Business] Michael London really made me think about the big picture and how you'd lead a company in a positive direction,â she says. And her peers in the leadership honor society Omicron Delta Kappa pushed her to be a better student, person, friend and leader, she adds.
From her classes to her extracurriculars, âMuhlenberg pushed me to broaden my horizons and see what's out there for everyone,â Davis says. âThat makes me a better leader who wants to build a strong future for everyone I impact in my career.â

The College’s Office of Community Engagement received the Outstanding Service Award at the 28th Annual Allentown Arts Ovation Awards hosted by the Allentown Arts Commission and the City of Allentown on May 10.
“The Office of Community Engagement believes that all of our communities benefit when people are able to share their voices through creative expression, and our organization is honored to be a part of making that work happen,” said Beth Halpern, director of community engagement at Muhlenberg.
The Office of Community Engagement enrolls students, employees and local communities in partnerships intended to catalyze personal, institutional and community change. Through programs in literary, performing and visual arts, Muhlenberg students engage regularly with local communities in creative activities. Youth work with students to achieve mutually generated goals, share stories and learn from one another. Programs both on campus and within local communities create shared spaces in which groups can connect through the arts.
“The Allentown Arts Commission believes that the arts, splendidly represented by this year’s honorees, are a major contributing factor to the current renaissance of our beloved city. Along with the amazing redevelopment efforts of both private and public entities, the arts have continued to imbue the area with a lively cultural ambience,” said Sharon Glassman, chair of the Allentown Arts Commission.
The Office of Community Engagement was one of six recipients recognized in six categories at the awards ceremony. In addition to the awards, scholarships in art, theatre and music were bestowed upon students from Allentown's high schools.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a highly selective, private, four-year residential college located in Allentown, Pa., approximately 90 miles west of New York City. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2200 students, Muhlenberg College is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative leaders through rigorous academic programs in the arts, sciences, business, education and public health. A member of the Centennial Conference, Muhlenberg competes in 22 varsity sports. Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

Milers Pace Track and Field Teams at Ursinus
 Friday, January 18, 2013







					 



The Muhlenberg track and field teams went the extra mile at Ursinus’ Collegeville Classic. Or, to put it more accurately, the Mules who ran the mile were extra good.

Milers accounted for five of the Mules’s 11 placewinners in their second meet of the season. With several team members sick or injured, Muhlenberg took a 
smaller-than-normal contingent to the meet. The women finished eighth out of 16 teams and the men tied for 13th out of 17.

Four Mules placed in the top eight in the women’s mile, led by senior Samantha Mayden, who came in second in an ECAC-qualifying time of 5:07.75. 
She was followed by junior Nicki Cronin in fifth, freshman Melanie Tramontina in seventh and sophomore Cassiah Sahl
in eighth.

In the men’s mile, freshman Alex Weiner (right) came in second.

Another freshman made an impressive debut for the Mules, as Rami Hamdan placed eighth in the shot put and came within five inches of hitting the
top 10 on the all-time performance list.

Sophomore Kieran Newcomb accounted for the other point for the men’s team with an eighth-place finish in the 3,000 meters. Although he
didn’t place, senior Ryan Hellings cleared 13-5¼ – two inches off his personal best – in the pole vault, twice needing his third
and final try to stay in the competition.

For the women, senior Erica Bash was third in the 800, junior Erin Saucier came in third in the pole vault, and a pair of freshmen –
Ashley Riley and Katrina Faust – placed fifth and eighth, respectively, in the triple jump. Riley’s distance of 32-9¾ was 
an improvement of more than a foot and a half from last week and landed her in ninth on the program’s all-time performance list.

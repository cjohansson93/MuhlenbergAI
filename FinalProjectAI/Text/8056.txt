Froberg Named Golfer of the Week
 Wednesday, October 1, 2014 - page 4







					 




Muhlenberg sophomore John Froberg was named Centennial Conference men’s golf athlete of the
week.

Froberg shot a 4-over-par 74, three strokes better than his previous career-low round, to help Muhlenberg to a second-place finish at the Muhlenberg Invitational on Monday. 
He finished with a flourish, shooting a 33 and putting only 12 times on the back nine.


Froberg, who averaged 81.6 strokes per round as a freshman last year, is averaging 78.2 through five rounds this year.

Froberg is the second Mule to win the honor this year, following freshman Daniel Eidman two weeks ago.

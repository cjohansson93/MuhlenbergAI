records, qualifiers for trackat last chance meet


The Muhlenberg track teams sent several athletes to the New York City Armory, giving them a last chance to qualify for next week’s NCAA
Championships, and they made the most of that chance.

The women’s distance medley relay team of sophomores Nicolette Miller and Kimberlee Yalango and seniors Alex Faust

and Jennifer Lynch crossed the finish line in 12:09.01, smashing the previous school record of 12:38.66. The Mule quartet hit the NCAA
provisional qualifying standard of 12:14.00, becoming the first relay team in the history of the Mule women’s program to qualify for the
national meet.

Faust also made the provisional mark in the pole vault, clearing 12-2, although that is not her best height of the season.

Junior Bobby Torphy (left) broke the school record in the 800 meters with an NCAA-provisional 1:53.19.

Muhlenberg will find out on Monday if the women’s DMR, Lynch in the mile and Torphy in the 800 will join Faust at the NCAA Championships.

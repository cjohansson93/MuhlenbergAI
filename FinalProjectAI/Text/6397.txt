The first two hitters in a batting order are usually tasked with getting on base to set the table for the power hitters.

But in the opening game of the Muhlenberg softball doubleheader with Drew, junior Devon Barber and sophomore Erica Wenzel showed they can drive in runs almost as well as they can score them. 




With her three runs scored, Barber moved into ninth place in school history with 76 in her career, one away from eighth. She’s also just four hits shy of 100.


 


The Mules’ first two hitters combined for five RBI in a 9-1 mercy rule win in game one. Unfortunately for Muhlenberg, it couldn’t quite keep up its high-scoring pace, and Drew took the nightcap, 4-3.

After Wenzel helped the Mules manufacture a run by scoring on a double steal in the first, she and Barber showed off their power potential in the third.

Freshman Heather Porrini, who started in the circle, helped her own cause by reaching on a leadoff single and came around to score when Barber drove double to left. Wenzel did her one better by launching an RBI triple to the right-center gap to make it 4-1.

One inning later, Barber delivered a triple of her own to the same right-center gap to bring in two runs. She then came home on Wenzel’s single up the middle to make it 7-1.

After Porrini retired the side in order in the top of the fifth, the Mules took advantage of three Drew errors to plate two more in bottom of the frame to end the game.

In addition to their combined five RBI, Barber and Wenzel also scored three times to account for eight of Muhlenberg’s nine runs.

After allowing two hits in each of the first two innings, Porrini surrendered just two over the final three frames and allowed just one run, the fewest she’s allowed in a complete game.

Muhlenberg fell behind early in game two, but went ahead 3-1 in the fifth on two-RBI single from sophomore Chelsea Benjamin and freshman Alyssa Schell’s RBI single.

The Rangers responded with a three-run homer in the sixth to go back in front. Following a leadoff walk, the Mules got the potential tying run to second with one out in the seventh, but Drew got back-to-back flyouts to close it out.

Schell collected three hits in game two to finish with four on the day, and Benjamin finished with two hits in the nightcap.

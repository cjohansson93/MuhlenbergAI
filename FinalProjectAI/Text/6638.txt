Senior Matt Parker reached the 149-pound consolation semifinals to highlight the first competition by the Muhlenberg wrestling team in more than a month,
the Will Abele Invitational at Ursinus.

Parker (left) went 3-2 at the tournament, running his season record to a team-best 7-5. After winning his opening bout, 8-6, he was pinned late in a match against the 
eventual runner-up. Parker then won two bouts in the consolation bracket, one on his first pin of the season, before getting pinned one bout away from the third-place
match.

Senior Chris Galletta split four bouts at heavyweight. He pinned his first two opponents, one in just 37 seconds, before dropping two close decisions.

Freshman Jimmy Coiley, making his Mule debut, pinned his first opponent at 157. Freshman Che Chengsupanimit won a major decision
in the 141-pound consolation bracket.

Muhlenberg finished 11th out of 13 teams at the tournament.

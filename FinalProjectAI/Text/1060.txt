Message to Students from President Harring
Tuesday, March 10, 2020

Dear Students,
Over the course of the past several weeks, senior staff and the Collegeâs Emergency Preparedness Committee have been monitoring the rapidly changing conditions of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Our primary concern is always to provide our students with an outstanding educational experience while caring for the health and well-being of our community.
Recently we have seen a number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, as well as those already reported in states nearby including New Jersey, New York, Delaware and Maryland. As information about the coronavirus has evolved, the College has worked thoughtfully and deliberately to make decisions to minimize the risk of exposure to the campus community. 
While there are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on campus, through our consultation with epidemiologists, health authorities and internal experts, we understand that eventually the virus will reach our community. At this point in time, that means taking action on behalf of our students, faculty and staff. 
I am writing to let you know that we have made several significant decisions that impact everyone at the College. The following measures are currently being put into place:

In-person classes will be offered on campus through Friday, March 13.
Alternate modes of instruction will be offered for all courses, beginning March 18 and will continue through April 13. Students will receive more information in the coming days.
All students must move out of their on-campus housing no later than Saturday, March 14 at 2 p.m. We strongly encourage you to remain on-campus through the end of classes on Friday, March 13. Students in study-abroad and study-away programs will remain in place. The Office of Housing and Residence Life will provide further details and instructions for checking out of campus housing.
Room and board will be provided only to students who have no option but to remain on campus, including those from countries with travel restrictions, those whose legal residence is Muhlenberg College and those with other extenuating circumstances. Students will be notified with instructions for applying to remain on campus.
For students in locations with large numbers of confirmed cases, we have considered the perspective that students are better off staying on campus rather than going home. In the email you will receive from housing and residence life tomorrow, you will learn how to apply to remain on campus, and your request will be considered on a case-by-case basis with direct guidance from the CDC and local Health Departments.
For Division III athletes, more information will be available by the end of the day tomorrow regarding college-sponsored NCAA competition.
For seniors, we want to assure you that you will graduate on time this May assuming you fulfill your course requirements. 

I understand that this is disappointing news, and I want to assure every student that we are committed to seeing you through the semester and will do all we can to support your success. There will be more twists in the road ahead, but I am confident in our plans because you have shown me that the Muhlenberg student community is strong and resilient.
During this time, the College will remain open and continue to provide the services necessary to fulfill our academic mission and serve the needs of our community. We will work to deliver an engaging online academic experience and look forward to the day when you will rejoin us on campus.
While you are away, we will remain in close contact. I encourage you to continue to check the on the website for ongoing updates. As I have said before, this is a difficult situation, but in true Muhlenberg fashion, we continue to work together as a community to address these challenges.
Thank you all,
Kathleen E. HarringInterim President

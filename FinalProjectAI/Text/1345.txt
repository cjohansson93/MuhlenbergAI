The driving force behind the Office of Multicultural Life (OML) is its students. Because of them, the Multicultural Center acts as a vibrant space where students can learn from one another and leave a lasting legacy on campus.
Whether it's through the network of support surrounding student leaders in the Emerging Leaders Program or the variety of ways student affinity groups create meaningful impact on campus, students remain the center of the activities, programming and events of the OML.
Alumni whoâve found a home within the Multicultural Center during their college years say the skills theyâve learned continue to make a difference in their lives, shaping the way they operate at work and the way they engage with their community.

Student Spotlight: Mustafa Hall '23
Meet a student who found an outlet for self-discovery and self-love through writing and poetry. Mustafa is the Op/Ed editor and a regular contributer to The Muhlenberg Weekly as well as a member of the President's Diversity Advisory Council.  Interview by AJ Henley '24. Photo by Anaya Battle '22.

Mustafa Hall â23, a sociology major with an Africana studies minor, says that his journey at Muhlenberg College has been influenced heavily by his identity.My relationship with my identity at Muhlenberg has been a process that has required immense self-work, introspection and therapy. When I look back at my freshman year, I see someone desperately trying to understand how they relate to a student body that is heavily white and straight.
Itâs obvious now that my self-identity never faced so much rattling. I simply didnât know who I was. However, over time and now being in my junior year, I understand where I lie in relation to those around me: I simply donât fit and I donât seek to. To fit in means to conform and to conform means to bend and crack at your spirit to make it palatable to those around you. I refuse to do that. With that, I have found my people who match my energy and am content with not blending in with the larger white, straight population of Muhlenberg. I find joy in standing out and I take immense pride in being overtly against the norm of what it means to be a Black man.
His identity as a Queer Black man affects not only his personal experiences, but his art as well.My main art form is writing and poetry. Writing has always been a major part of my life as well as my Black Queerness. Writing allows me to better understand myself and the lived experiences that have influenced how I navigate the world. Furthermore, in every piece that I write (poetry, an Op/Ed, etc.), my Blackness and/or Queerness are involved in some way or another. Itâs impossible, in my eyes, to separate art from complex and layered identities because they feed and thrive off of each other. Without my art, my Black Queer identity is hollow. Same thing for my writing in relation to my identity.  
From drag shows to open mic nights, he has thrived onstage at Muhlenberg, though he didnât expect it.My all-time favorite experience at Muhlenberg was being a part of my first ever drag show, the first semester of freshman year. Prior to this show, I have never performed in front of people nor nurtured the feminine energy that coats parts of my soul. This show taught me so much, but the lesson that I hold closest to my heart is that I can do absolutely anything that I set my mind toâand that I am a powerful being, filled with vigorous energy. It also bettered the relationship I had with my Queerness and melted years of shame off while simultaneously pushing me to ask myself, âWho am I and how do I want the world to see me?â 
While heâs all for external validation, his best advice to first-year Mustafa would be to know your worth and tap into your inner self.Younger me spent so much time putting my hand out, trying to collect and preserve the external affirmations of the world. The game changed when I put my hand to my chest and told myself everything I wanted to hear from the world. I became my number one supporter. From my love life, to friendships, to mental health and body image, this mindset of relying on myself to build myself up has bled into every single aspect of my life. And I finally feel like Iâm living.

Student Spotlight: Shobha Pai '24
Meet one of the students behind VOICES, the Office of Multicultural Lifeâs new podcast. Interview by AJ Henley '24. Photo by Anaya Battle '22.

Shobha Pai â24, a  and  double major, says she enjoys working at the Office of Multicultural Life because it provides her new opportunities.My favorite thing about working at OML is the opportunity to work with amazingly talented and creative people. Everyone at OML is wonderful and working with them really helps me succeed both creatively and emotionally. I think itâs really helped me explore my creative side and made me more familiar with planning and execution. It has also given me connections to faculty and staff that I would not have normally made.
The  also lets her focus on diversity, which is extremely important to her.Diversity is beautiful. It showcases the beautiful differences we have as human beings with cultures and experiences. My experience at Muhlenberg has taught me so much about the importance of thinking about things from different experiences. Diversity is one of the core things that I try to keep in mind when working in any field.
One of her favorite things sheâs done at Muhlenberg is working with prospective international students, but this year sheâs working on VOICES, OMLâs new podcast, along with fellow intern David Holman '22.The accessibility that podcasts have really piqued my interest, and itâs one of the reasons I love them. I think everyone enjoys listening to music when they are doing mundane things, but podcasts actually give you information and entertain us.
While she is kept busy by her commitments on campus, she says the community inspires to keep going.Everyone at Muhlenberg helps make it easier to juggle multiple responsibilities. The people here inspire me to be the best version of myself everyday. The community at Muhlenberg has shaped me into someone who is confident and loves herself. I have met some beautiful people here, and they have really supported me throughout my journey here. My advice to first-year students would be to relax and just go with the flow. [As] human beings, [we] try to control every aspect of their lives and get very stressed out. Sometimes we just need to let go.

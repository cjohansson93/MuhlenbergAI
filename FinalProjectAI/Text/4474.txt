defense leads men’s basketballto scotty wood final 


The Muhlenberg men's basketball team prides itself on in-your-face defense, and in the first round of the Scotty Wood Tournament the Mules displayed a little in-your-face offense too.

The Mules held Rosemont to 23.3-percent shooting and breezed to a

72-49 win to advance to the Scotty Wood championship game. Their opponent in the final will be Gallaudet, which in the most exciting game of the day came back from a 19-point second half deficit to defeat Wilkes, 74-66.

The Ravens (1-1) hit a three-pointer on their first possession, then did 
not score again for another five minutes as Muhlenberg (2-0) went on a 12-0 run to take command. Long dry spells were common for Rosemont, which did not crack the 40-point barrier until the last three minutes of the game.

"This team brought some matchup difficulties with their quickness," said senior David Gwyn, who contributed 3 points, 3 assists and 5 rebounds in 13 solid minutes. "We played a lot of good team defense, which is what we need to do to win. Coach always says that our offense is going to be there some nights and other nights it won't, but defense is something we can bring every night."

The offense was there on this night, with much of

it coming from junior Spencer Liddic, who scored a game-high 21 points on 8-of-12 shooting. Senior Evan Tozer, playing against a team coached by his brother, added 11 points and 5 assists and was at the center of the game's most unusual moment.

Less than four minutes into the second half, the Mules were on offense when Tozer's elbow caught a Rosemont player in a bad spot. The bloody nose resulted in a wrestling-like delay as the floor was cleaned up with disinfectant.

"Evan is strong with the ball, which is why he's been playing for the 
last four years," said Gwyn. "It's just one of those things. Evan feels bad about it." 

Muhlenberg's players and staff had every reason to feel good about the play of the freshmen post players. Kevin Hargrove scored 10 points, pulled down 7 rebounds and blocked 3 shots, and James Albano recorded a game-high 12 rebounds to go along with 6 points. 

"Hargrove is playing great, doing exactly what he needs to do," commented Gwyn. "And Albano is great at getting around the rim and finding the ball. He's going to be a vital part of this team."

Muhlenberg is 13-12 all-time in Scotty Wood finals and will go for its third championship in the last six years.

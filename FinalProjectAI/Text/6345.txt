Baseball Drops Centennial Conference Home Opener
 Friday, March 30, 2012







					 



The Muhlenberg baseball team will have to wait at least another year to get its first Centennial Conference season sweep of Ursinus. After beating the Bears on the road on Tuesday, the Mules lost the return meeting at home, 12-4.

Ursinus (9-10, 1-1) broke open a one-run game by scoring multiple runs in each of the three middle innings. 

The Mules (16-7, 1-1) had plenty of baserunners but were victimized by some terrific defensive plays by the Bears, two of which led to inning-ending double plays. Muhlenberg grounded into four twin killings in the game.

Freshman Nick Plinio (left) had two hits, including his team-leading fourth triple of the season, and drove in a pair of runs.

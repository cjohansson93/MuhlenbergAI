Travelers enjoyed 14 nights aboard the exclusively chartered MS Amadeus Silver. Stops included some of Europeâs most historic and beautiful cities, including Amsterdam, Netherlands; Nuremberg, Germany; Vienna, Austria; Bratislava, Slovakia and Budapest, Hungary.
In the Footsteps of Luther - May 23-June 3, 2017
Five hundred years ago, a German monk turned Europe's Christian community upside down when he questioned the role of indulgences in the Roman Catholic Church. When Martin Luther revealed his 95 Theses on October 31, 1517, so began the Protestant Reformation. Even though popular belief is that Luther dramatically nailed his work to the door of the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg, historians say that the religious revolutionary spread his work with the help of a new revolutionary device, the printing press. On this trip, travelers learned about Martin Luther's life, walked in his footsteps and discovered his world on an exceptional educational program through this historic region of Germany. 
Provence - October 18-26, 2016
Alumni and friends joined us for this magical trip and met up with two Muhlenberg professors, Drs. Paul and Eileen McEwan. Provence is where sundrenched beaches and undulating hills tie the Mediterranean to the Alps. Its very name conjures images of idyllic days with dazzling light illuminating the verdant countrysideâs sloping vineyards and lush olive groves. The colorful scenery of the region enraptured CÃ©zanne, Chagall and van Gogh. Writers have flocked here and extolled it as the Great Land of Inspiration for all that is French and fabulous.
Alaska Cruise - June 19-26, 2016
Travelers cruised from Vancouver to Anchorage on an epic journey that allowed ample time to explore the rich wonders of Alaska and the northern coastline of the Pacific Ocean. Glacial lands, majestic mountains, goldmining towns, Inuit and Yupik culture and a frontier-like atmosphere â this is a vast expanse of incredible natural beauty and culture. Best of all, travelers experienced Glacier Bay and Hubbard Glacier. The seas in the region are teeming with marine life, including sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, walrus, salmon and, of course, the magnificent North Pacific right whale. Here, travelers were able to experience peace among vast and beautiful lands and seas and come to understand an isolated tranquility that inspired and invigorated their souls.

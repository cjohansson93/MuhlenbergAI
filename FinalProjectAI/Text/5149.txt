fall athletes receive academic awards



Several Muhlenberg fall athletes and teams were honored by national organizations for their academic accomplishments at various points during the recently completed spring semester.

Cross Country: Sophomores Kate Mahoney and Bobby Torphy were named to the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) Division III All-Academic Team. To be eligible for the award a student-athlete must carry a minimum 3.5 cumulative grade point average and must finish in the top 25 percent of the field at his or her respective NCAA regional meet.




Field Hockey: Muhlenberg won the Team Academic Award from the National Field Hockey Coaches Association (NFHCA) for having a team GPA of 3.0 or higher.

Seven team members – seniors Michelle Consiglio and Cara Rothacker, juniors Tara Cohn and Kristen Sabia and freshmen Brittany DeAngelis, Courtney DeAngelis and Cait Teegarden – were named to the NFHCA National Academic Squad. The National Academic Squad recognizes those student-athletes who have achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or higher through the first semester of the 2008-09 academic year. Consiglio and Rothacker made the Academic Squad all four years with the Mules.




Football: Six Muhlenberg football players earned membership in the National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame (NFF) 2009 Hampshire Honor Society, which is comprised of college football players from all divisions of play who each maintained a 3.2 GPA or better. The Mules honored were seniors Joe Caporoso, John DeLuca, Edward DeRisi, Jim Jeffers, Mike Nolan and Erik Snyder




Men’s Soccer: Senior Billy Dalton was selected to the National Soccer Coaches Association of America Scholar All-East Region second team. To be nominated, a student-athlete must have at least a 3.30 cumulative grade point average throughout his career; start more than 50 percent of all games and be a significant contributor to the team; and be a junior or above in academic standing. Dalton was chosen in the College Division, which consists of all schools not in NCAA Division I.

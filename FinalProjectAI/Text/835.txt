For well over a century, media and communication have played a central role in creating an increasingly global society, serving a vital role in grassroots movements and world-wide initiatives. When you join Muhlenbergâs Department of Media & Communication youâll work closely with faculty to research, critique and create media of all formsâvisual, digital, print, oral and hybrid formsâand investigate the social, political, economic and cultural contexts that both shape and are shaped by these converging media.
Critical thinking meets hands-on experience through engaging coursework, internships in professional environments, experiential and service-learning in local communities and global contexts. The media & communication major fosters graduates who are not only information literate, but who become information leaders in helping to realize the democratizing potential of media.
The department is dedicated to the integration of media analysis and media production for social justice in an integrated, liberal arts framework. Featuring faculty from across the humanities and social sciences who are highly-regarded national and international leaders in their fields, students can take advantage of a range of coursework that speaks to the diverse range of the field. We weave media making and critical media studies into all of our courses in the interests of teaching students to be ethical, critical media consumers and producers and are a highly interconnected department, collaborating with programs in film studies, documentary storytelling, dance, English, creative writing and psychology, to name a few.

âMuhlenberg taught me the importance of cultivating relationships. Both at Muhlenberg, and in the workplace, networking has helped me to learn and exceed.â
âSomething I learned at Muhlenberg is the idea of being well-versed in all aspects of broadcast production. Learn everything you can about your chosen field, even if itâs not your passion or what you want to do professionally. Having extra skill sets distinguishes you from the crowd. No one wants to hire a âone-trick pony.ââ

âDr. Jansen's Writing for Media* class helped me become a more effective communicator both in a formal and day-to-day sense by helping me be concise and to the point with all of my work.â




 











âEveryone in the Comm Department has always been so supportive and given great criticism and advice for my work.  So many people in my CUE class were people I had other classes with previously, and we were a small tight knit group that really felt like a home and a family.â
-Ali Ruchman '19





 











âMuhlenberg taught me how to write well! A solid foundation in communication is easy to take advantage of at a place like Muhlenberg, where we all received great opportunities to learn and improve on our writing skills. Not everyone has this background, and it can take you far in the working world!â




 











âMy media/comm major directly tied into my rotational development program at Olympus in their Communications Department - I was prepared for each rotation because of everything I learned as a Media/Comm major.â



 











âMany of my Film Studies courses focusing on international cinema gave me a greater appreciation for these films and an understanding as to how they are produced, distributed, and exhibited on the film festival circuit, giving me a foundation upon which to continue to learn and grow in an actual film festival environment, and has directly helped me in so much of the film programming work I do there. Outside of the classroom, being the Muhlenberg Activities Council Comedy Chair also taught meâ




 











âMuhlenberg felt like home because it's easy to see how the professors are dedicated to the students, and how the students care for each other as well.â 
-Sara Rosenman '17



 











âI learned a lot about modifying your writing voice in response to the target audience and intention of the piece. Also, this could be said for a lot of majors, but I learned how to incorporate feedback and manage multiple projects at a timeâ



 











âMuhlenberg allowed me to mix different areas of interest. Anyone can learn how to use a camera or an editing software, but it doesn't mean anything if you're not passionate and knowledgeable about whatever subject you're documenting. Knowing the technical side of filmmaking is important but having an understanding of storytelling or knowing how to interact with your character are equally as important.â 



 











"Even when I wasn't in class or working the equipment closet with Amanda and the other student-workers, I was always still in Walson because it was my favorite place on campus. I can't wait to come back and see the new renovations!" Ayanna Costley '19




 











âMy Media & Communication major helped me to build strong relationships, create unique programming and juggle competing priorities.â



 











 "My Media & Communication Major prepared me with the knowledge and confidence to explore careers and network with alumni in the field. It encouraged me to research potential career paths in broadcast journalism, public relations and more." 




 











âI'm the Manager of Television & Radio Operations within Ithaca College's Roy H. Park School of Communications, I serve as the advisor and General Manager of the college's student-run radio and television stations.â âAt Muhlenberg College, I learned the importance of a liberal arts education and being well-rounded. It's valuable to have a knowledge of a variety of subjects. You never know when this background will aid in covering a news story or reporting at an event.â






 











Thoughts on Walson Hall: âAll that the building needed was some blankets and a nice firm pillow to be considered a âhome.â The staff were always readily available like a close family member, the computers were always reliable like a warm home-cooked meal, and everything about the Film Studies/Media Com department was nurturing. A home away from home, perhaps, and it still is.â




 











âI work as a project manager, guiding producers and internal PBS teams on editorial and deliverables from production to air of a show.â âThere's nothing like coming back to Muhlenberg and Walson Hall. Walson was a place where I truly discovered what I love to do...and coming back is always a reminder that I'm still on the right path.â




 











âCurrently I juggle both PR and social media for several different accounts. The work is fun and allows me to flex creatively, whether it's through writing, content creation, or brainstorming ideas for campaigns.â âMuhlenberg taught me a lot about coming into my own, exploring my passions, and diving head first into projects. I've taken everything I've learned at Muhlenberg, inside and outside the classroom, and have been able to apply it to my job at Catalyst.â






 











"My Media & Communication major helped me be able to communicate effectively with everyone I interact with and it helped my writing skills for job applications."



 











âAt Muhlenberg, I balanced a full course load and extra curricular activities each semester, which taught me how to manage my time and multi-task; two skills that have proved especially useful in my day to day work.â



 











Thoughts on Walson Hall: âAs a student, from the moment I entered the doors, I felt at ease. I was always surrounded by faculty and students who were supportive, creative, & encouraging. I spent the majority of my days & nights in Walson: in class, working on editing projects, or filming the news show for MCTV. I'm surprised I never actually slept there! Walson was a place I could escape from whatever was going on in my life and chat with friends or professors about anything with no judgment."



 











âThe time management skills I built during my time at Muhlenberg have become so important to me in my work life. I think that applies to any career!â âWhile I was at Muhlenberg, I was also a student worker in the department and a dedicated member of MBC. Walson Hall became more of a home for me than any other spot on campus. I always felt it was a place I could go to focus on schoolwork when I needed to, or to relax and chat with Amanda and the rest of the faculty when I needed a break."



 











âMy biggest take away from my Muhlenberg Major was that there is no magic.  There is art, there is science, there is hard work, self-confidence, and LUCK.â



 











âA lot of my job ends up being mediation between designers, departments, crew, etc. Because of my liberal arts education, I feel so much better equipped to handle those situations in a stress free manner and understand a situation from various points of view. While I technically work directly in the field of my other major (theatre), I use the skills I learned in the Media & Communication Department daily.â





 











ââWe notice what we notice in accordance with who we areâ - Robert Coles I read this quote during my sophomore year at Muhlenberg College, and it has stuck with me since then. Muhlenberg not only teaches you valuable practical skills, but the components of compelling storytelling and how to effectively share one's voice. These tools have been extremely useful in my career so far.â



 











âFrom walking into my first âMedia and Societyâ class with Dr. Pooley, thinking I was going to be a theatre critic, to my final CUE course with Tony Dalton - who ended up serving as a reference for my law school admissions application, I grew into a professional ready to take on the world.The staff in Walson inspired me to understand where my passions were rooted from, and how I could use those passions to be a meaningful voice to change the world around me. I will always be grateful.â



 











âMy Media & Communication major helped me at every step of the way in my career. I've needed the resources I learned. PR, the early days of digital marketing.â

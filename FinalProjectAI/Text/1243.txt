Research Interests
My research interests include PÃ³lya Urn models, Leader Election problems, Applied Probability/Statistics and Statistics Education.
Teaching Interests
I have taught a variety of statistics and probability courses. My aim in the classroom is to empower students with the knowledge to critically analyze statistics they are presented with in everyday life. I am always looking for new ways to involve students in the classroom.
Other Interests
I enjoy cycling, almost any kind of art, playing music, taking advantage of nice weather and going for walks with our dog Caleigh, and of course spending time with my wonderful husband, Jonathan.

Men’s Tennis Breezes in Opener



The Muhlenberg men's tennis team began its spring season with a 9-0 shutout of Penn State Berks at Hillcrest Racquet Club.

The closest match for the Mules came at No. 1 doubles, where senior Robbie Goldwein and junior Jordan Rutt won 8-5. In singles play, which consisted of sets to 10, Muhlenberg dropped only 11 games in six matches.

Freshman Ben Berkowitz scored a 10-0 shutout at No. 5 singles.

Muhlenberg has almost a month off before resuming its season in earnest against Elizabethtown on March 16.

For the second straight week, junior Peter Rice of the Muhlenberg men's indoor track and field team had a memorable meet at the Armory.

Competing in the NYU Team Challenge, Rice broke the school record in the 400 meters, which he set on the same track eight days ago. More importantly, Rice hit the NCAA provisional qualifying mark. His time of 48.67 on the banked track converts to a flat time of 49.17, easily faster than the qualifying standard of 49.85.

As of Monday, only five Division III athletes had posted a faster 400 clocking this season, and the time would have gotten him into the NCAA Championships last year. Rice was an All-American as part of the distance medley relay team in 2009 but has yet to run in the national meet in an individual event.

Rice was one of three Mules to finish in first place in the teams' final tuneup for next weekend's Centennial Conference Championships. Freshman Erin Saucier won the pole vault for the second time in four days with a personal-best 10-6, and senior Bobby Torphy captured the mile.

Several Mules clocked times that qualified for the all-time performance list, including for the women sophomore Samantha Mayden (left) (third-fastest mile in program history), sophomore Lexie Daniells (fourth-fastest 400), junior Kimberlee Yalango (second-fastest 500), sophomore Erica Bash (third-fastest 500) and freshman Nicole Cronin (fifth-fastest 800).

On the men's side, sophomore Isaiah Vaughn climbed into a tie for second on the performance list with a 23.05 in the 200, sophomore Brendan Smith moved to second in the 3,000, and freshman Jeffrey Phillips ran the third-fastest 500.

Senior Seth Hershman made a big leap in the shot put, throwing a personal-best 44-8 to enter the performance list in eighth place.

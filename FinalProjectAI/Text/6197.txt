Women's Basketball Falls to Gettysburg in Overtime
 Saturday, January 14, 2012 - page 2







					 




A day after Friday the 13th, the number 13 still proved to be unlucky for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team against Gettysburg.

In a tight affair, the Bullets denied the Mules the second 13-0 start in school history, handing them a 60-57 overtime loss. Muhlenberg (12-7, 7-1) still sits in first place in the Centennial Conference thanks to Haverford’s win over Johns Hopkins.

With the game tied with less than three minutes to play, junior Alita Zabrecky poked a steal near midcourt, converted the layup and drew a foul to put the Mules up by three.

Gettysburg (7-8, 5-5) responded with a free throw and a layup to tie the game with 14.1 seconds remaining.

The Mules had a chance to win it on their final possession of regulation, but the layup attempt hit off the iron, and the game headed to overtime.

The two teams traded free throws to start the extra period before the Bullets jumped out to a three-point lead at the midpoint.

A Kate Clawson layup and Zabrecky jumper put the Mules ahead by one with 1:15 to play.

But Gettysburg scored the final four points of the game and blocked a potential game-tying 3-pointer on Muhlenberg’s final possession to pick up the win.

Senior Alexandra Chili led the Mules with 19 points and three steals, and Zabrecky added 15 points, four steals and three assists.

Sophomore Leeann Lanza (left) tied her career high with 13 rebounds to go along with seven points.

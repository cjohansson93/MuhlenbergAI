Track Teams Score High at Lehigh
 Saturday, January 21, 2012 - page 3







					 




The Muhlenberg track and field teams had multiple impressive performances at the Lehigh Multi and Invite, their second meet of the indoor season.

Three Mules – senior sprinter Peter Rice, sophomore pole vaulter Erin Saucier and the men’s 4x400 relay team – topped the best performances in the Centennial Conference entering the weekend’s competition.



Rice came in fifth in the 200 meters with a time of 23.09, not far off the school record of 22.40 he set on a banked track last year. The best time in the CC as of last weekend was 23.17. 

Rice also ran on the 4x400 team, along with sophomores Andrew Onimus, Darnell Davis (right) and Jake Ullmann. The quartet’s time of 3:29.08 was good for third place and ranks ninth on the Muhlenberg all-time performance list.

Additionally, Rice moved up to third on the performance list in the 60 meters with a time of 7.23. Junior Isaiah Vaughn now stands second at 7.22 (the record is 7.18). Vaughn missed qualifying for the six-person final by the narrowest of margins, running 7.216, just 0.003 seconds behind the last qualifier.

Saucier, the 2011 CC indoor champion, came in sixth in the pole vault with an indoor personal best of 10-11 3/4, which places her in a tie for 15th on the national performance list.

Other highlights included junior Samantha Mayden placing second in the 3,000, one spot ahead of sophomore Nicki Cronin (left), who moved into fourth all-time. Junior Erica Bash placed eighth in the 800, and sophomore Stephanie Carnevale finished fourth in the 60-meter hurdles.

Team scores were kept at the meet, which was split almost evenly between Division I, II and III teams. The Mule women were eighth out of 12, and the men were ninth out of 13. The only Division III squad to finish ahead of Muhlenberg on both sides was Moravian, and for the women the margin was only three points.

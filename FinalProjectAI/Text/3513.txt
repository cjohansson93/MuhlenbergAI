WOMEN’S BASKETBALL ADVANCES
TO CHAMPIONSHIP GAME


Ho-hum.

Fans expecting something special from the Centennial Conference
women’s basketball semifinal game between Muhlenberg and McDaniel
instead got just an ordinary, routine contest.

Of course, routine for these two teams is a game decided by a minimum of
points where the winner isn’t determined until the final buzzer
sounds. That is just what happened for the

this season are the most by a Mule freshman since 1997.



third time this season (with the added wrinkle of overtime thrown in), and
for the third time it was the Mules coming out on top.

A layup by junior Meghan Courtney with 2:51 left in overtime proved
to be the game-winning basket as Muhlenberg defeated McDaniel, 56-55, to
advance to the CC championship game.

The 15th-ranked Mules (24-2) will face Johns Hopkins (20-6), a 53-49
winner over Dickinson in the first semifinal, which also came down to the
final minute. Muhlenberg and Johns Hopkins met for the CC championship
five straight years from 1996 to 2000, with the Blue Jays winning three.

Muhlenberg led for most of the game and had a 14-point cushion, at 39-25,
at the 13-minute mark. The Mules went nearly 10 minutes without a field
goal, however, and – just as it had done in the previous two games
– the two-time defending champion Green Terror clawed back, finally
tying the score at 49 on a three-pointer from the corner with 59 seconds
left.  

Senior Stephanie Coluccini responded with a layup to put Muhlenberg
up by two. McDaniel tied the game at 51 on two free throws with 7.8
seconds left, and a last-second attempt by the Mules was blocked. 

The Green Terror led 53-52 in overtime when Courtney received a post entry
pass and her defender fell down. Action stopped for a moment as the
players expected a foul to be called, but 





Courtney almost completed her eighth double-double of the season in the
first half, notching 10 points and nine rebounds.



the whistle didn’t blow and Courtney banked home the wide-open shot.

After a McDaniel turnover, freshman Lauren Boyle sank two free
throws with 2:13 left to give Muhlenberg a 56-53 lead.

The Green Terror made a layup and got the ball back following a Mule
turnover. With 1:03 left, senior Kristen Piscadlo stepped in to
draw a charge on a McDaniel player driving in for a go-ahead layup.

Muhlenberg missed a shot on its next possession, but Boyle forced a tieup
on the rebound to keep the ball with the Mules with 36 seconds left. The
Green Terror blocked a shot with 10 seconds left, raced down the floor and
took a medium-range jumper. It glanced off the iron as the buzzer sounded,
and Muhlenberg had escaped with the win.

The Mules’ three victories over McDaniel came by a total of five
points. The two teams have played five one-point games the last five
years, including two this season.

Boyle led all scorers with 19 points and also pulled down 10 rebounds for
her first career double-double. Courtney also had a double-double with 13
points and 13 rebounds, while Piscadlo added 12 points.

Muhlenberg held McDaniel, which came in 12th in Division III in shooting
percentage, to 30.2 percent from the field and a season low in points. The
Mules also had a 46-35 advantage on the boards, reversing a 45-31 Green
Terror rebounding advantage from the teams’ meeting nine days ago.

With the win, Muhlenberg established a new school record of 14 home
victories in a season (the last four by a total of 10 points). This also
marked the first the time the Mules defeated a team three times in the
same season.

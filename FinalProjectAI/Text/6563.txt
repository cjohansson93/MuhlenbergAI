Football Falls to Hopkins in Big Conference Matchup
 Saturday, September 22, 2012 - page 4







					 


The Johns Hopkins football team pulled away late and defeated Muhlenberg, 33-21, in a showdown between two of the front-runners in the Centennial Conference.

Both teams entered the game undefeated and with an average margin of victory of more than 24 points. With the win, the 16th-ranked Blue Jays extended their regular-season winning streak to 18.




Hogh's first career touchdown was the Mules' second on a blocked punt this season.


Muhlenberg came in with an unscored-upon streak of more than 170 minutes, but Hopkins needed only five plays after the opening kickoff to take a 7-0 lead on a long touchdown run. 

The Blue Jays were in good position to score again after two penalties on a punt return gave them the ball at the Muhlenberg 20. But freshman Khiry Hughes intercepted a tipped pass on the next play.

Thirteen plays later, the Mules tied the score when senior Dan Deighan hit classmate John Gruver in the back of the end zone on fourth down from the 1.

Two field goals in the second quarter gave the Blue Jays a 13-7 lead at the break. Thanks to a 40-yard completion from Deighan to senior Isaiah Vaughn, Muhlenberg drove to the Hopkins 21 during the quarter but was stopped on fourth-and-1.

The teams traded touchdowns again in the third quarter, with the Mules’ coming on a 13-yard run by senior Terrence Dandridge.

It was 20-14 entering the fourth quarter before Hopkins put the game away with two long touchdown drives of 75 and 84 yards.

The Mules scored their final touchdown with 2:32 remaining when senior Tim Vogel blocked a punt, and junior Joe Hogh picked up the ball at the 25 and ran it in.

Muhlenberg amassed 315 total yards against a defense that came in allowing an average of 174.7 per game. Dandridge rushed for 70 on 16 carries, and Deighan passed for 177 yards. Senior John Merklinger caught seven passes, and senior Isaiah Vaughn recorded his second 100-yard game of the season with 104 yards on three catches.

For the defense, senior Matt Johnson (15), junior Kory Crichton (12) and Vogel (11) all reached double figures in tackles.

rutt named to all-region team



Senior Lauren Rutt of the Muhlenberg field hockey team was selected to the Longstreth/National Field Hockey Coaches Association All-South Region second team.

The Mules’ field leader from her central midfield position, Rutt scored a career-high five goals and earned All-Centennial Conference first-team honors in 2007. She helped 
Muhlenberg (12-7) earn the third seed in the CC playoffs by scoring an overtime game-winning goal against 19th-ranked Gettysburg in the last game of the regular
season.

Rutt, who finished her career with 33 points on 10 goals and 13 assists, is the Mules’ first all-region selection since 2004. 

“Lauren has been such a strong presence on our team for the last four seasons,” said head coach Megan Eddinger. “She not only has been a wonderful player on the field, but she is also a great motivator and role model for our younger players. Lauren has definitely made a positive impact on our program and in the Centennial Conference.  She is very deserving of this honor.”

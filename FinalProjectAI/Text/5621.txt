baseball wins opener of three-game series


One Fisher helped beat a whole team of them.

Playing against a team that 



Eric Hammond tied a dubious school record by getting hit by pitch three times. Hammond came to the plate five times but had no official at-bats, adding a sacrifice and walk to his three HBPs.



had his name displayed on its uniforms, sophomore Dan Fisher went 3-for-4 and drove in four runs as the Muhlenberg baseball team defeated St. John Fisher, 14-11, in the opener of a three-game series. 

It was the fourth straight win for the Mules (6-4), who after averaging nearly 20 runs in three games against Wisconsin Lutheran and Misericordia, two teams that combined to win nine games last year, proved that they could put up runs against top-level squads. St. John Fisher (6-2) won 28 games and earned an NCAA Tournament bid in 2007.

Perfect execution led to Muhlenberg scoring four runs to take a 4-1 lead in the bottom of the second. Junior John Kalis and freshman Bobby Spindler set the table by leading off with back-to-back singles, and junior Paul Lehrman bunted them over. 

Senior Danny Asip followed by getting down a suicide squeeze, and when the pitcher threw the ball away, a second run scored and Asip wound up on third. A groundout brought in Asip, and the fourth run scored when Fisher and junior Eric Hammond pulled off a double steal play. 

The Cardinals came back to tie the score, but the Mules took the lead for good with five in the fourth. Sophomore Eric Pomroy tripled in the go-ahead run, then scored on a single by Fisher. Junior Christian Conti, who walked four times, had his hot smash to third booted to bring in another run, and two more scored on a groundout and wild pitch.

Fisher’s two-run single keyed a three-run fifth inning, and two bases-loaded walks resulted in a pair of runs in the sixth.

Down 14-6, St. John Fisher made the game interesting by scoring five runs in the eighth, but Muhlenberg escaped with the lead, and the game was called for darkness.

Pomroy finished 2-for-3 with a pair of extra-base hits and three runs scored, and Asip scored four times. Although outhit 15-11, the Mules took advantage of seven walks and four hit batsmen and struck out only once.

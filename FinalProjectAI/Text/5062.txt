Volleyball loses tough one


For the third straight year, the road team took the match between the Muhlenberg and Swarthmore volleyball teams in four sets.

Despite leading 21-19 in the fourth set, the Mules (7-10, 2-3) could not hold off a late Swarthmore (15-6, 5-1) rally and saw their three-game winning streak snapped.




With nine kills and just one error in 20 attempts, Gordon hit a match-high .400.



Muhlenberg dug a big hole in the first set, but a five-point rally brought it to within four at 19-15. Later the Mules won six of eight points to get to within 23-20, but the Garnet hung on to take the set.

In the second set, senior Phylicia Lee recorded four straight kills to put the Mules up 15-11. Leading by a slim 22-21 margin late in the set, Muhlenberg ran off three straight points  capped by a kill by freshman Jennifer Seeba  to tie the match at one set apiece.

The Garnet took the third set 25-17, but the Mules jumped out to an early 6-0 lead in the fourth thanks in part to a block and a kill by senior Brittany Williams. Back-to-back kills by Lee and a block by sophomore Jackie Price made it 15-10, but the Garnet hung tough. Swarthmore quickly erased a 21-19 Muhlenberg advantage by rattling off five straight points and eventually took the set 25-22.

Lee finished with 14 kills and 13 digs, while Price had nine kills and eight blocks, the most by a Mule all season. Senior Christina Cangelosi had a match-high 29 digs, and sophomore Davi Gordon added 19. 

As a team the Mules had 10 blocks, their second-highest total in a match this season.

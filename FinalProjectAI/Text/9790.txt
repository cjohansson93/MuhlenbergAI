On Friday, November 12, 2021, Muhlenberg College will inaugurate its thirteenth President, Kathleen E. Harring, Ph.D. This significant day in the history of the College will also celebrate the students, faculty and staff that make the campus a vibrant community of scholars. 
Harring was named president by Muhlenberg's Board of Trustees in June 2020 and served as interim president of the College beginning June 2019, but the impact of COVID-19 pushed back the inauguration ceremony. First, Harring had to lead Muhlenberg through one of the greatest challenges it has faced in its 173-year history: the continued educational and administrative operations of the College while navigating the health and safety issues of a global pandemic.
At the start of the inauguration ceremony, trustees, faculty, College and community leaders and delegates from higher education institutions across the country will participate in the time-honored tradition of an academic procession. For the first time at Muhlenberg, a representative from each student organization will join in the academic procession as well.
Harring, who is Muhlenbergâs first female president, joined the College as a member of the psychology faculty in 1984. She also served as the Collegeâs provost and in that role, was instrumental in guiding a number of important initiatives, including serving as co-chair for Muhlenbergâs 2017 strategic planning process, implementing procedures to support the Collegeâs diversity initiatives and overseeing planning for new post-graduate programs.

Saturday, November 13 will bring a Celebration of Muhlenberg for the campus community. A campus festival, to be held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Parents Plaza and on the College Green, will feature games, fall treats, giveaways, performances and a zipline. The Muhlenberg Mules football team will face Moravian University at noon at Scotty Wood Stadium. 
At 3:30 p.m., a faculty panel, âScholarship and the Liberal Arts,â takes center stage at the Center for the Arts, Empie Theatre. It will feature a conversation with a panel of the College's Rising Scholars faculty, facilitated by Lora Taub, dean of digital learning and professor of media & communication. âA Celebration of Student Research, Scholarship and Creative Work,â including poster sessions and experimental theatre, will take place in the Center for the Arts Galleria at 4:30 p.m. 
The campus weekend events wrap up on Sunday, November 14 with an Interfaith Chapel Service.

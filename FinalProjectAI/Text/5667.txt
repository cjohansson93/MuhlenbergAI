women’s basketball to “think pink”



The Muhlenberg women’s basketball team is co-sponsoring a “Think Pink” program this week, culminating in Saturday’s home game against Johns
Hopkins.

The “Think Pink” initiative is a global, unified effort by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) to assist in raising breast cancer awareness on the 
court, across campuses, in communities and beyond. More than 900 schools are participating.

Muhlenberg’s involvement includes the following:

• Fans attending the Saturday doubleheader against Johns Hopkins are asked to wear pink to show their support for the cause.
• Tables will be set up at entrances to Memorial Hall, where fans can donate $1.00 or more and be given a pink ribbon to wear during the game. 
All proceeds will go towards cancer research.
• Tables will be set up during lunch hours in Seegers Union on Friday and Saturday for the same reason.
• The women’s teams from both Johns Hopkins and Muhlenberg will wear pink shirts during pregame warmups in a show of solidarity against this terrible disease.

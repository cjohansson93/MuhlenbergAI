ROUGH DAY FOR HOOPS, WRESTLING




It was a difficult day for all three Muhlenberg teams in action.

Men’s basketball lost to Gettysburg, 69-57. The Mules (12-11, 10-6) led 12-2 early, but the Bullets eventually tied the score at 23-all and led by three going into halftime. Gettysburg (12-10, 10-6) went up by double digits early in the second half, and Muhlenberg got no closer than eight the rest of the way.

The loss drops the Mules into a three-way tie for second place in the Centennial Conference with Gettysburg and Ursinus. Fifth-place Washington is just one game behind at 9-7 with two regular-season games to play.

Sophomore Spencer Liddic (right) led the Mules with 25 points and 16 rebounds, nine of which came on the offensive glass.

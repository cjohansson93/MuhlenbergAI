Men's Tennis Cruises by Moravian to Force Matte Tie

Sometimes the less you know, the better.

That was the case for Andrew Brod and his teammates on the Muhlenberg men’s tennis team. 

The senior knew the history between the two Lehigh Valley rivals, but did not know that the Matte Award, given annually to the school with the better record in head-to-head competition in 16 sports, hung in the balance.

So when Muhlenberg swept the singles matches en route to an 8-1 win, Brod was delightfully surprised to learn that all-sports competition ended in a tie for just the fourth time in its 24-year history. The tie extends Muhlenberg’s unbeaten streak in the Matte competition to nine years (7 wins, 2 ties).

“It feels great to win this match for Muhlenberg,” Brod said when he was informed of the Matte tie. “I just wanted to treat it like another match and go out there and play my game. Everybody else seemed comfortable out there, and this was a good win.”

After winning two of three doubles matches, the Mules made quick work in singles play to dispatch the Greyhounds, who qualified for the Landmark Conference playoffs.

Senior Jordan Rutt avenged a three-set loss from a year ago to his Moravian counterpart, who was 10-2 entering the match, by posting a 6-3, 6-3 win at No. 1. He also teamed with sophomore Jason Teitelbaum for an 8-5 win against a team that was 9-3 at No. 1 doubles (right).

Freshman Daniel Lakham dropped just two games in his straight-sets win at No. 2 singles,




Rutt (foreground) and Teitelbaum (background) have won three of their last five matches at No. 1 doubles.




and sophomore Ben Berkowitz earned a 6-4, 6-4 victory at No. 3.

Brod picked up his first singles win of the season, dropping just three games at No. 5, and also teamed with Berkowitz for an 8-0 shutout at No. 3 doubles.

Freshman Keith Beizer earned his first career singles win in impressive fashion, 6-1, 6-0, at No. 6. Classmate Eric Chavis completed the singles sweep by battling back after dropping his first set in a tiebreaker to win the second set 6-2 and finish off his opponent at No. 4, 12-10, in a third set supertiebreaker.

The win snapped the Mules’ three-match losing streak to Moravian and gave them back-to-back wins in their last two home matches. And that winning streak put a big smile on Brod’s face. 

“I couldn’t ask for anything nicer to have some good wins at the end of the season,” Brod said. “Winning this match felt even more special because of the team bonding that has developed throughout the season. We’re such a close group, and this was a great way to end our last home match.”

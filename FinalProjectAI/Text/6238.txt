The City of Brotherly love had lots of love on the track for Muhlenberg at the prestigious Penn Relays.

Senior Peter Rice and sophomores Andrew Onimus, Darnell Davis and Jake Ullmann teamed up to win the Pop Haddleton MAC/Centennial 4x400 relay at historic Franklin Field.

Rice passed three runners on the anchor leg to edge out Centennial Conference rivals Ursinus and Johns Hopkins in a time of 3:24.13. It’s Muhlenberg’s first win at the Penn Relays in more than 60 years. 

The relay carnival is held just a few miles from Interstate 95, which also happens to be a common connector for the four runners, who all hail from the I-95 corridor.

Onimus and Ullmann grew up just outside of Philadelphia and ran in front of the hometown crowd, while Rice is from Boston and Davis is from New York.

 Anne-Marie Leiser Skin Deep: Ethnographic Observations in American Popular CultureThis independent study was a year-long analysis of popular American performances. I attended and observed a nationally recognized fashion show held by Ebony Magazine, studied news articles pertaining to the Miss America Pageants, and did in-depth research through various forms of media, interviews, a focus group and literature. The end result was a compilation of my research discussing how young American women perceive beauty in terms of race, age, gender, and nationalities. This independent study taught me time-management and also how to scrutinize and understand body and race issues that are still prevalent in our American popular culture.

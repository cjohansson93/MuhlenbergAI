Recent Muhlenberg graduate John Scuderi was named to the All-Mid-Atlantic Region third team by the American Baseball Coaches Association. 
Scuderi is the fifth player (and first infielder) in program history to earn all-region honors. Following the selection of John Muha last year, this is the first time the Mules have had an all-region selection in back-to-back years.
An All-Centennial Conference second-team selection, Scuderi led Muhlenberg in batting average (.358), hits (49), doubles (13), home runs (3), extra-base hits (17), RBI (30), slugging percentage (.533) and on-base percentage (.428) – all career highs – in 2014.
The third baseman was third in the CC with 18 RBI in league games and hit .533 with two doubles, two home runs and five RBI in four games against CC champion Haverford. He also was 2-for-4 for four runs scored against NCAA Tournament participant Penn State Berks and went 5-for-5 in the second game of a doubleheader against The College of New Jersey.
Scuderi finished his career tied for seventh in team history with 107 runs scored and as the program’s all-time leader with 403 assists. He also ranked in the top 20 in hits (143), doubles (28), extra-base hits (40), total bases (200) and RBI (78). Click here for the complete all-region team.

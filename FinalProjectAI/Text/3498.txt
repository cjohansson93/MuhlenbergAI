For the Muhlenberg track and field teams, their most disappointing moment of the indoor season was also the one that showed they were on the right path.

The Mules were all set to travel to East Stroudsburg the first weekend

of February for what was to be an important meet. When the athletes were informed at the last minute that the trip was cancelled due to icy road conditions, the disappointment that showed on their faces was a sure sign that they were serious about the team and committed to its success.

travels to Haverford for the Centennial Conference Championships.

The men will be looking to continue their upward climb after placing sixth in 2008, fourth in 2009 and third last year, while the women seek to finish in the top three for the sixth time in seven years.

the positive from it. The distance runners met later that evening and had one of our best workouts of the season.

The results since the cancelled trip have been very positive, culminating with the Mules sweeping the CC athlete-of-the-week awards last week. 

On the mens side, junior Peter Rice was honored for the second week in a row, and he will play a big role in Muhlenbergs placing. Rice has the fastest time in the CC this season in the 200 and 400 and is scheduled to run those races twice each, individually and in the 4x200 and 4x400 relays.

Petes amazing, said Dolan. He definitely brings a huge level of talent, and hes one of the hardest workers on the team. Hes the kind of guy whos willing to sacrifice winning an event to run four events instead of two and score as many points as he can for the team. He really has an understanding of the big picture.

Rice heads up a group of sprinters that may be the best in the CC and will look to score as many points as possible to offset 14th-ranked Haverfords expected dominance in the distance events. Sophomore Isaiah Vaughn is seeded in the top 10 in both the 55 and 200; he, Rice, freshman Darnell Davis and senior Derek Yates have the fastest seed time in the 4x200, which the Mules won last year.

Dolan will run on the 4x800, on which he won gold medals in 2008 and 2009. Last year, Muhlenbergs four-year streak of winning the 4x800 was snapped by Haverford.

Thats always kind of been our race, he said. Its important that we win it back.

The womens athlete of the week was freshman Erin Saucier, who is tied for the top seed in the pole vault and will look to give the Mules their fifth straight gold in that event. The lone returning gold medalist on the womens team is sophomore Colette Faust in the high jump.

Sophomore Samantha Mayden is the only Muhlenberg runner besides Rice seeded in the top five in two events (the mile and 3,000). She is one of several young Muhlenberg runners striving to establish themselves in the CC on a team that was dominated by a pair of seniors last year.

Were all really excited, said Dolan. We know we have a really good opportunity to place high.

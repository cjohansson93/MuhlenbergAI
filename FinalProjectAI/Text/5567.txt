Winston brings women’s tennis win


When Danielle Winston began to experience cramps in her calves early in her No. 5 singles match, Muhlenberg women’s tennis coach Linda Andrews approached her about defaulting.

“I said no way,” said the freshman. “I knew it was going to be a close match, and I didn’t want to let my teammates down.”

She didn’t. Winston’s gutsy 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 win in the last match 



Druker has a combined record of 25-11 this year.


on the court was the difference as the Mules edged Washington, 5-4, in their last regular-season match of 2008.

The victory clinched Muhlenberg (9-4, 8-2) the third seed in next weekend’s Centennial Conference playoffs at Johns Hopkins.


Baseball Drops Extra-Inning Heartbreaker



The Muhlenberg baseball team was one out away from winning its sixth game in a row, but Ursinus spoiled things with a dramatic 6-5 victory.

The Mules (17-14, 8-6) led 5-3 with two out in the top of the ninth when an infield error prolonged the game. The next batter hit a two-run homer, and the Bears (14-11, 6-8) scored the winning run in the 10th.

Sophomore Dan Fisher hit his first career home run, a two-run blast in the second, to stake Muhlenberg to a 3-0 lead.

After Ursinus tied the score, the Mules went ahead with single runs in the seventh and eighth. The first came in when junior Eric Hammond tripled (one of his three hits) and scored on a suicide squeeze; the second on an RBI pinch-single by freshman Joseph DiCecilia.

 The Mules will face second-seeded Swarthmore in the semifinal round.

The entire contest against the Shorewomen (10-5, 5-3) lasted more than four hours, and Winston was on the court for most of that time on an unseasonably warm day. She played a long doubles match that came down to a tiebreaker, then started cramping up in the second game of her singles match. Hobbling around the court, Winston managed to force a tiebreaker, where she came back from a 6-3 deficit by winning the last five points.

By the time Winston started the second set, every other match had been completed, with the teams tied at 4-all. With teammates and parents (including her own, in from Wisconsin) 
cheering her on from outside the fence, Winston breezed in the second set to secure the victory for Muhlenberg.

“I knew I couldn’t hit like I usually do, so I just tried to be consistent and get as many balls back as I could,” said Winston, whose discomfort did not deter her from leaping at the net to return a volley late in the match.

“I wouldn’t have won if it hadn’t been for my teammates,” she added. “They really pushed me through the match.”

Several of those teammates also came up big. Senior  No. 6 Jacquelyn Magner, playing at home for the final time, rebounded after dropping the second set to win in three in the next-to-last match on the court, tying the score. Junior Jenn Powell won in straight sets at No. 1 against the 14th-ranked player in the region. Powell, who also won her doubles match, was pushed to a tiebreaker after jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the second set, but dominated the tiebreaker, winning 7-0.

Freshman Caitie Druker won with relative ease at No. 2 singles, capturing a 6-1, 6-1 victory to improve to a team-best 8-2 in CC matches.

Dates and times for the CC playoffs will be determined early next week.

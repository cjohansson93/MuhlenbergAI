comeback win completes tennis sweep


Although her Muhlenberg women’s tennis team was leading 8-0 against Ursinus, junior Jenn Powell just couldn’t afford to lose her match. 

Eventually, Powell (left) secured a win in a pulsating contest at No. 1 singles in Mules' 9-0 victory over the Bears. 

Powell saved three match points while coming back from a 5-1 deficit in the second set to win 7-5 and tie the match at two after losing the first one, 6-1. 
She claimed the tiebreaking set, 10-5, to post her fifth straight singles victory.

Another Muhlenberg player showed what it means to fight until the last moment. Freshman Lindsay Schmidt, at No. 6 singles, 
had her impeccable 8-0 Centennial Conference record (both singles and doubles) on the line in her match against Graciela Gallo. 

Often, it would be difficult for a player without much experience to bounce back after falling 6-1 in the first set, but that wasn’t the case with Schmidt, who prevailed 
for the rest of the match. She won the second set, 6-1, and clinched a 10-5 win in the tiebreaking set.

Muhlenberg needed no comebacks in the other four singles contests, surrendering only 14 games, and also won handily in doubles.

The Mules extended their winning run to five matches, and all five have been 8-1 or 9-0. With a 6-1 Centennial Conference record, Muhlenberg stands in second place as it 
prepares to close the season with three matches against teams that made the CC playoffs last year (Swarthmore, Franklin & Marshall and Washington).

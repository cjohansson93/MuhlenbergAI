how the mules stole 2010


The following poem by Muhlenberg’s assistant athletic trainer was originally published on Mule Sports Daily on December 31, 2003, but we’re running it again for a few reasons: (1) Muhlenberg
is deeply committed to recycling; (2) There are many current followers of Mule sports who were not with us seven years ago; and (3) It is still a fun read!

This is the last Mule Sports Daily of 2010. We’ll be back on January 2, 2011. Thank you for your support of Muhlenberg athletics during the past 12 months,
and best wishes for a happy holiday season!

Every Mule down in Mule-ville, liked Muhlenberg a lot.
But the rest of the Centennial Conference. Did NOT!

The opposition hated the &#146Berg! Every week of the season.
Now please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

It could be our softball team got too many hits.

It could be that soccer just wouldn’t seem to quit.
But I think the most likely reason of all,
May have been playing the Mules was like hitting a brick wall.

But, whatever the reason, football or field hockey
They&#146d show up to play, a little less cocky.
<P>
For they knew every Mule in Mule-ville was tough<BR>
Cross Country, tennis and volleyball as if that wasn&#146t enough<BR>
Lacrosse, golf and basketball they say it with fear<BR>
2010 was exhausting, 2011 is almost here!
<P>
The opponents sit around, fingers nervously drumming<BR>
We must find some way to stop 2011 from coming.
<P>
For next year, they knew<BR>
Mule baseball and track<BR>
Will have success early, leading the pack.
<P>
And then! Oh, the cheers! Oh, the Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!<BR>
That&#146s one thing they hated. The Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
<P>
Then the Mules, young and old would rise from their seats<BR>
Clapping their hands, and stomping their feet.
<P>
They would cheer, Let&#146s Go Mules!  And &#146Berg is the Best!<BR>
The cheerleaders made sure that the crowd did not rest.
<P>
And then they&#146d do something rivals liked least of all!<BR>
Every Mule down in Mule-ville, the tall and the small<BR>
Would all come together, when opponents were idle<BR>
Chalk it up in the books, another Centennial Conference title!
<P>
They&#146d win! And they&#146d win! And they&#146d Win! Win! Win! Win!<BR>
And the more the rivals thought of this Muhlenberg win,<BR>
The more rivals thought, &#147We must stop this whole thing!&#148
<P>
&#147For several years we&#146ve put up with it now!&#148<BR>
&#147We MUST stop 2011 from coming!&#148<BR>
&#147But HOW?&#148
<P>
Then they got an idea!  An awful idea!  The opponents got a
wonderfully awful idea!
<P>
<IMG SRC="/sports/winter04/grinch2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 ALT="Happy
Holidays!">
&#147We know just what to do!&#148 The opponents laughed to
themselves.<BR>
&#147We&#146ll just go to Allentown and be little elves.&#148<BR>
&#147Instead of bringing them luck, and things to make them better,
we&#146ll take all of their equipment.&#148<BR>
&#147The sooner the better!&#148
<P>
With all the equipment gone to try to change the rules<BR>
They realized it would take more than that to shut down the Mules.
<P>
And the opponents, with their feet not knowing where to go<BR>
Stood puzzling and puzzling: &#147How could it be so?&#148
<P>

They won without javelins!<BR>
They won without bats!<BR>
They won without shoulder pads, racquets, hurdles, or hats!
<P>
And they puzzled for hours, till their puzzlers were sore.<BR>
Then the rivals thought of something they hadn&#146t before!<BR>
&#147Maybe winning,&#148 they thought, &#147takes a little bit more.&#148
<P>
And what happened then...?  Well ... in Mule-ville they say<BR>
That the Centennial Conference became stronger that day!
<P>
For they realized they musn&#146t continue to feel spite<BR>
For they realized perhaps they must play to a new height.<BR>
And they brought back the equipment and all of the tools<BR>
Then they<BR>
They themselves<BR>
Congratulated the Mules!

Field Hockey Falls by One Goal to No. 11 Ursinus in Finale
 Friday, October 28, 2011







					 







Beating a nationally ranked team – one that handed them one of their worst losses – on their home field would have been a phenomenal way for the seniors on the Muhlenberg field hockey team to end their careers.

It didn’t quite happen, but the Mules’ 2-1 loss to No. 11 Ursinus showed that

the five seniors helped the program head in the right direction in their last year.

Last year, the Bears outshot Muhlenberg 51-0 in a 12-0 win. This year’s game was much different, with the Mules owning an advantage in shots for most of the game. 

Muhlenberg ended the season with a 5-12 record, a three-win improvement from last year, and in its last two home games lost to the top two teams in the Centennial Conference (both ranked in the top 15 in Division III) by respectable scores of 3-1 and 2-1.

After a pregame ceremony to honors playing seniors Brittany DeAngelis, Courtney DeAngelis, Jillian Katz, Renee Norton and Shelby Smith and senior manager Renée Kato, the Mules controlled play for the early part of the game, holding the Bears (14-3, 9-1) without a shot for the first 10 minutes.

Ursinus scored on its second shot to take the lead at the 12:01 mark. With less than five minutes left in the half, however, Norton sent in a pass from the right corner that hopped over several sticks and found Erin Cummings alone in front of the goalie. The sophomore finished for her first goal of the season, tying the game.

Just 59 seconds later, the Bears scored off a penalty corner to regain the lead.

That’s the way the score remained throughout the entire second half, even though each team took at least 10 penalty corners. Smith made a defensive save with under 10 minutes left to keep the deficit at one. Katz appeared to have tied the game in the final minute, but the goal was disallowed because the ball hit the foot of a Muhlenberg player.

Junior Kristen Dornenburg made 10 saves to move into second place on the Mules’ all-time list with 405 in her career.

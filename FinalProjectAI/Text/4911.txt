women’s basketball back in winning groove


Before its game against Bryn Mawr, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team celebrated “Retro Night” with old warmups and uniforms, 
tie-dye t-shirts and a warmup mix featuring songs from the 1960s and ’70s. 

The Mules then went retro during the game, winning 67-43 to rediscover their good vibes after Saturday’s bummer of a loss to Gettysburg.

“We were able to get back in the groove,” said 




Senior Alexis Bates, playing perhaps her final game at Memorial Hall, hit a three-pointer with 6:08 left in the first half, capping a 7-0 run that 
gave the Mules a 21-14 lead.



senior Brenna Ferster. “We needed to get our shooting and confidence back.”

The victory keeps Muhlenberg (18-4, 15-3) alone in second place in the Centennial Conference with two regular-season games left to play. The Mules have already wrapped up a first-round bye, but in order to host the tournament they will need to win out and have Gettysburg lose to third-place McDaniel on Saturday.

“As a team we’re just focused on getting better going into the posteason,” said Ferster. “We want to finish strong and go out and get another championship.”

Muhlenberg needed a strong finish against Bryn Mawr, because the Owls (2-21, 0-19) hung tough with the Mules in the first half and trailed just 30-26 heading into the break. Muhlenberg led 41-34 with 13:26 to play when it put the game away, going on a 24-3 run that included a stretch in which Bryn Mawr was kept off the scoreboard for more than seven minutes.

Seven different Mules scored during the big run, and in all 10 Mules played at least 10 minutes.

Sophomore Alexandra Chili led Muhlenberg with 14 points, and junior Alexandra Berlin had 11. Freshman Alita Zabrecky added 10 points, six rebounds and three assists.

All in all the Mules had a rad night, and not just because they got an important win with the season winding down.

“It was very fun,” said Ferster of Muhlenberg’s first “Retro Night.” Two of the Mules (senior Kaitlyn O’Malley and junior Sheila Cook) got into the spirit by wearing their
hair in pigtails, and Zabrecky donned a headband. “I had a lot of fun making the mix of 
songs we ran out to. Coach gave us some CDs, and Chili is the ’70s girl on the team, so she helped, too.”

Groovy, baby.

Viewing Of Pedro Almodovar's âBad Educationâ At Muhlenberg College



As a part of the series The Ethics and Politics of Identity, Muhlenberg College will hold a viewing of the film âBad Education,â directed by Pedro AlmodÃ³var, on October 17 at 7 p.m. in the Recital Hall, Center for the Arts. 


	 Wednesday, October 12, 2005  01:59 PM

A discussion moderated by Tom Cartelli, English, with Francesca Coppa, English, and Troy Dwyer, Theatre, will follow. This event is free and open to the public.
“Bad Education” is Almodóvar’s critically-acclaimed 2004 film chronicling the relationship between two boys discovering desire, movies and fear in a Catholic boarding school. Their love story is complicated by Father Manolo, the school principal and literature teacher, who both witnesses and takes part in these discoveries. 
 The Ethics and Politics of Identity is a year long series of programs, sponsored by the Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics , about the ethical challenges that surround the changing categories of social, national, and global identities.

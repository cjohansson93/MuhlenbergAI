overnight sensation:volleyball second in buttermaker





Freshman Bryn Baker had double-doubles in assists and digs in both Saturday matches. For the tournament, she averaged 9.13 assists and 2.73 digs per set.


Less than 12 hours after completing a ragged five-set win against winless Neumann, the Muhlenberg volleyball team 


returned to Memorial Hall for the second day of the Buttermaker Tournament. Although the players were the same, the team was noticeably different.

The Mules swept a strong York team in three convincing sets in its 


More Drama for Field Hockey



The Muhlenberg field hockey team went on another thrill ride, falling at Montclair State, 1-0 in overtime.

It was the fourth straight one-goal game for the Mules (2-2), with three of them coming against teams that were nationally ranked last year and/or in this year’s preseason poll. Three of the games were decided in overtime; the other on a goal with 3:12 left.

The Red Hawks (3-1) scored the lone goal with 4:06 left in the first overtime period. Freshman Kristen Dornenburg made 6 saves in goal.

first match to advance to the championship match, where they lost to undefeated and 22nd-ranked Haverford in four matches.

With York having swept FDU-Florham, which had swept Muhlenberg, on the first day of the Buttermaker, the prospects did not look good for the first match. But the Mules (3-6) jumped all over the Spartans and stayed in control the entire match, winning 25-17, 25-15, 25-16.

Muhlenberg featured an efficient and balanced attack that made only seven errors in the match and had five players combine for all 37 of its kills: senior Brittany Williams and sophomore Davi Gordon with 8 apiece and senior Phylicia Lee, sophomore Jackie Price and freshman Jennifer Seeba each with 7.

The defense came through with 8 blocks, 5 by Seeba. Gordon and senior Christina Cangelosi tied for the team lead with 14 digs.

The result meant that Muhlenberg, York and FDU-Florham all tied for first in Pool A with a 2-1 record. The Mules won the tiebreaker by virtue of their point differential, setting up a title contest against three-time defending Centennial Conference champion Haverford.

Playing with confidence, Muhlenberg took the first set 25-19 – just the third set lost by the Fords (9-0) this season. Haverford stepped up its game, however, and won the next three sets to claim the championship.

Cangelosi was named to an all-tournament team for the second straight week after collecting 13 digs against Haverford and averaging 5.13 per set in the tournament. Lee (11 kills, 14 digs) and Gordon (10 and 18) both recorded double-doubles in the final.

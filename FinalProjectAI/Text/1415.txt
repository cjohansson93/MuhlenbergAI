Bias Resource and Education Team

The Bias Resource & Education Team (BRET) represents a cross section of the Muhlenberg College community (faculty, administrators, and students) who are trained to:

Provide support and advocacy to any community member affected by a bias incident
Offer outreach and educational programming to the campus community on bias
Create opportunities for dialogue across campus on bias-related issues
Assess and coordinate response to any campus-wide bias-related issue

What is a bias incident? 
A bias incident occurs when someone engages in bias-related conduct. Muhlenberg Collegeâs Equal Opportunity and Nondiscrimination Policy defines bias-related conduct as âa broad range of conduct that can be verbal, non-verbal, written, or physical conduct that harms, discriminates, or harasses anyone in our community based on a Protected Class.â A âProtected Classâ is age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, marital status, national or ethnic origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws.
Bias-related conduct that does not rise to a policy violation can be addressed through conversations with a restorative focus, education, training, conflict resolution mechanisms, and assessments.   
BRET does not replace processes at the College for reporting and response to acts of discrimination, harassment, and hate crimes defined in the Equal Opportunity and Nondiscrimination Policy. Any act of discrimination, harassment, or a hate crime should be immediately reported to Campus Safety and Equity & Title IX so that safety, support, and options for addressing conduct can be assessed in a timely manner.

Women’s cross country posts top times




Field Hockey Comeback Falls Short




After falling behind early, the Muhlenberg field hockey team rallied back to pull with one of Johns Hopkins (8-5, 6-1), but could not get any closer and fell, 2-1.

Erin Cummings (above) directed a pass from Tiffany Kreider past a drawn out goalkeeper to put the Mules (1-11, 1-5) on the board 10 minutes into the second half. It was the first goal of the freshman's career and Kreider's first assist of the season.

Cronin has led the Mules in all four of her races this season.




Muhlenberg freshman Nicole Cronin added to her already impressive cross country debut season with an eighth-place finish at the Leopard Invitational.





Cronin's time of 22:22.90 was her fastest mark this season, and was good for tops among all Division III women

She was one of seven Mule women to post their best time of the season at the event, as Muhlenberg was the top Division III team, finishing in sixth place. Sophomore Samantha Mayden finished 17th overall, and was the third Division III female to cross the line, with her time of 23:06.50.

After back-to-back weekends of hard racing, the Mule men were instructed to use the race as a tempo run to prepare for the Centennial Conference Championships later this month. 

With its top runner taking the weekend off, Muhlenberg finished ninth in the field comprised mainly of Division I schools. 

Sophomore Brendan Smith led the Mules with his 40th-place finish.

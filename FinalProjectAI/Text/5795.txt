The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team suffered its second straight one-goal loss on the road to one of the top teams in the region, falling at Elizabethtown, 2-1.

The Blue Jays (6-1) are ranked fourth in the Middle Atlantic Region. The Mules (3-2), who are ranked eighth, lost at No. 3 Franklin & Marshall, 1-0, on Saturday.

Muhlenberg nearly took a two-goal lead into halftime. With 12 minutes left in the half, a shot by junior Steven Tenenzapf got by the goalie but was cleared off
the line by an Elizabethtown defender. The Mules put one by the goalie and into the net with 2:45 on the clock when junior Brendan Carroll scored his first goal of the
season with a blast from the top of the box.

Elizabethtown tied the score on a header in the 63rd minute and netted the winner on a rebound with just 3:46 left to play. A Muhlenberg shot that would 
have tied the game in the final 30 seconds was saved.

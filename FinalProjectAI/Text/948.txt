A Muhlenberg education is designed to be a challenging, rewarding, lifelong experience. In addition to enrichment of the mind, the College's commitment to our students includes fostering opportunities for leadership. Students can serve as models for their peers in many ways, from management responsibilities in clubs and organizations to service as resident advisors and hall directors. Muhlenberg's student life team is committed to supporting and increasing the leadership roles available on campus.

Although not a requirement for graduation, many of our majors participate in one or more internships while pursuing their degree.  These opportunities can help students learn more about potential career paths and gain hands-on experience working in the wide field of environmental science.  Students choosing to intern during an academic semester generally stay close to campus, including places like the Lehigh Valley Zoo, The Wildlands Conservancy, The DaVinci Science Center, and the Lehigh Gap Nature Conservancy. 
Those who work during the summer can pursue positions in government, advocacy, education, and government in areas around the country and world, for example:

New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services
Central Park Conservancy (NYC)
Langan Environmental Engineering (across the U.S.)
Association for Urban Farming (Israel)
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
Smithsonian museums and National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.
Federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 

Muhlenbergâs Career Center is very helpful to those with an interest in pursuing an internship, and you are encouraged to explore their website.

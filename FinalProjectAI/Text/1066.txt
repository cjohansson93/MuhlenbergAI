Message about Remote Work & Training from President Harring
Sunday, March 15, 2020

Dear Colleagues, 
Information about the spread of COVID-19 continues to evolve and change the ways in which we need to consider our own work. As always, our primary concerns have been for the health and safety of each member of our community. We value all members of the Muhlenberg community and understand that we could not accomplish our goals without the work that each of you does. As we plan for the days ahead, I want to thank you for helping us move through this difficult time.  
In the Remote Work and Time policy updates posted to our website last week, we stated: 
On an as-needed basis, Muhlenberg College is implementing voluntary, temporary remote work arrangements for employees whose job duties are conducive to working from home. Decisions on positions that are eligible for remote work and the decision to begin remote work require approval of an individualâs supervisor. Employees with compromised immune systems or other medical concerns may reach out directly to human resources to discuss remote work.
We want to say again, that if you have the technology you need to work successfully from home, and your job responsibilities are suitable for remote work, please consult with your supervisor to begin doing so immediately. For those of you who need assistance with technology or training, OIT will conduct two sessions on Monday in Seegers 111-113 for in-person and remote instruction to ensure you have the tools needed for remote work. 
Remote Work Training for Staff - Monday, March 16, 20201:00 - 2:00 p.m. Live in Seegers 111-113Online: Join Hangouts Meet - meet.google.com/mjc-guux-ypa
3:00 - 4:00 p.m.Live in Seegers 111-113Online: Join Hangouts Meet - meet.google.com/mjc-guux-ypa
If you are attending in person, please bring the technology with you that you will be using from home if you are able (College-provided or personal laptop, for example). We are also working with OIT to allow forwarding of an individualâs office phone to their personal device so work related calls can be answered remotely. 
Please use this time to the fullest with your teams to develop plans, communication tools, schedules and rotations of coverage that can support you for the next few weeks. OIT and other offices will be working diligently this week to make sure you have the tools you need to do your work.
At this point in time, campus remains open. While the goal is to maintain continuity of business functions, please use your best judgment and practice social distancing while on campus. Your supervisors will work with you on understanding the impact of remote work for your individual office over the next week. Also, please be mindful and supportive of your colleagues whose work can only be done as needed on campus.
Finally, if you are designated as âessential staff,â you will receive a separate email early this week defining what that means and if your position is indicated as âin personâ or âon callâ or as âbackupâ as it relates to continuing to manage the functions of the College during this crisis period. We are working to make sure everyone has a clear understanding of their position and responsibilities.
We greatly appreciate your flexibility and adaptability as we continue to make adjustments to best address the needs of our employees and the College. 
Thank you and be well, Kathy

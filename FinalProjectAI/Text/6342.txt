Pitchers Sparkle in Baseball Split at McDaniel

In a year highlighted by hitting exploits and big scores, the Muhlenberg baseball team used its arms to split a Centennial Conference doubleheader at McDaniel.

The Mules dropped the first game, 3-1, and came back to win the second, 4-2. Muhlenberg matched the Green Terror (12-6, 1-3), which entered the weekend with a 2.40 staff ERA, pitch for pitch.

Junior Billy Rogers tossed a complete-game four-hitter in the opener, but was victimized by two unearned runs. After giving up two hits and two runs in the first inning, he allowed only two hits the rest of the way, retiring 11 of 12 batters in one stretch.

Muhlenberg (17-8, 2-2) scored its lone run in the fourth on a two-out RBI single by sophomore Nick Kennedy. The Mules loaded the bases with one out in the ninth, but the game ended on a force at home and a flyout.

Freshman Christian Ferlan was the pitching star of the nightcap, allowing two runs and striking out five in eight innings to improve to 4-0. He was at his best in the bottom of the fifth, striking out the No. 2 and No. 3 hitters in the Green Terror lineup with the tying runs in scoring position.

After giving up a leadoff single in the bottom of the ninth, Ferlan gave way to junior Ryan Rechten, who retired all three batters he faced for his sixth save of the season. The six saves match the most by a Mule reliever since 1983.

Muhlenberg broke a 1-1 tie with three runs in the third, the first coming on an RBI single by sophomore Brett Rosen. 
After a second run came in on a double steal, freshman Chris Manfredonia drove in Rosen with a single.

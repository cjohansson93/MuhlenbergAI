Men’s Soccer Routinely Beats Moravian



please note: original article has been altered to reflect scoring change

The Muhlenberg men’s soccer team has fallen into a rut — and the squad doesn’t mind one bit.

The Mules won by the score of 2-0 for the third straight match to open the season, netting an early goal and adding another score late to down local rival 



Gonzalez’ assist was the second of his career.




Moravian. The result gives Muhlenberg an early 1-0 lead on the Greyhounds in the race for the Matte Award, the all-sports competition between the two colleges.

“It was important to come in here today and keep up the pace,” junior Billy Dalton said. “It’s good to start the season 3-0 before going into a tough conference schedule.”

Muhlenberg forced the action from the opening whistle and was rewarded for its efforts in the ninth minute, when sophomore Adison Weseloh drilled a low shot past the Moravian goalie from 18 yards out. Dalton set up the goal, advancing down the middle of the field and drawing two defenders before sliding a pass to an open Weseloh on his left.

The Mules continued to control the game but were unlucky in their finishing. Senior Karim Assous had several close chances early in the second half, including a turnaround shot from 18 yards that bounced off the crossbar in the 58th minute.

The start of the second half was also a busy time for Muhlenberg’s defense, as goalkeeper Peter Bennett made a leaping catch on a close-range shot in the 48th minute. Twelve minutes later, a Moravian shot got past an advancing Bennett and would have scored had junior A.J. Barnold not cleared the ball away.

In the 74th minute, Eric Gonzalez’ long pass up the field found Eric Miller, who maneuvered past two backs and beat the onrushing Greyhounds keeper at the 18-yard line to score his first career goal and secure the win.

The Mules, who have opened with three straight shutouts for the second year in a row, now enter a challenging stretch in their schedule. They open conference play Saturday at Franklin & Marshall and visit Elizabethtown and Gettysburg before hosting Dickinson and Johns Hopkins.

Dalton likes Muhlenberg’s chances. “Our defense has been jelling really well and [Bennett] is keeping the ball out of the net,” he said, “If we keep playing so well defensively, we’ll be hard to beat this year.”

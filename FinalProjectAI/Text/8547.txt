COM 220, 221 - Free Culture
1 course unit
This course explores current debates surrounding free culture, specifically, 1) the history and development of notions of copyright in the nineteenth century and âintellectual propertyâ in the twentieth century, 2) processes of media convergence and digitalization in todayâs media, 3) the development of the free, open source software (FOSS) movement in the late 1970s and the challenge to proprietary software found in the Linux operation system, 4) digital distribution of music, the Napster debate, and remix culture in the music industry, 5) Wikimedia and the new power of âcrowdsourcingâ in knowledge labor, 6) Net neutrality, and 7) the philosophy and development of the digital commons, enshrined in the Creative Commons license and the legal implications of such licenses for artists, musicians, audiences, and citizens.  Students will use an open source computer OS (Linux) and free software tools to contribute to a class digital project on a topic related to the free culture movement. 
Meets general academic requirement SL (and W when offered as 221).
 
COM 223, 224 - Feminist Media Studies
1 course unit
Feminist scholars have long studied the relationship between gender and media.  This course will explore how television, film, popular music, and cyberculture play a central role in representing, defining, circulating, and constructing gender.  This class takes a multi-media approach; for example, we will study how cultural forms depict different gendered characters on TV shows like Sex and the City and Modern Family, how certain genres are particularly open to queer interpretations like the musical, and how teen girls appropriate the magazine format to produce and circulate their own stories.  This course will be oriented historically to examine how gender roles are constructed by media in specific historical contexts, and then how those representations change (or do not change) over time.  Since much research on gender and the media has historically focused on femininity, this course will likewise focus on femininity, but we will also study the relationship between media and masculinity and sexuality, as well as how gendered identities are always also informed by other relations of power, such as race, class, ethnicity, and age. 
Meets general academic requirement SL and a linked (IL) course when offered as 223. 
 
COM 225 - Journalistic Traditions
1 course unit
Introduces students to the great traditions of interpretive, documentary, and advocacy journalism and photojournalism.  Includes analysis of exemplary works in the tradition and provides some opportunities to develop skills through individual projects. 
 
COM 227, 228 - Scientific Communication
1 course unit
Introduces students to the many aspects of scientific communication, exploring how the information scientists produce gets to other scientists, the media, policymakers, and the public at large. Students will examine the history of the field, challenges with current models of scientific communication, and case studies from the current literature. Students will also learn to write, edit, and add references to Wikipedia articles, ultimately producing credible online science entries. 
Meets general academic requirement SL and is a linked (IL) course when offered as 228. 
COM 240 - Introduction to Film Analysis
1 course unit
Introduces different strategies and different approaches for analyzing film and video texts, including formal, narrative, social/cultural, and feminist.  Students will develop an understanding of the grammar, vocabulary, and conventions of film and video production and the factors that shape viewersâ reception.

COM 246 - CopyRight & Culture
1 course unit
Copyright was envisioned in the United States as a motivating force for creativity in âscience and useful arts.â Yet the scope and duration of copyright have expanded dramatically in recent decades. How does this expansion affect both the user and producer of creative works? Has copyright achieved its creative ends, or outgrown its usefulness to become a hindrance to creativity? Students in all disciplines will benefit from learning in this course the fundamentals of copyright law that pervade our everyday lives, affecting our use and authoring of creative works. The course will cover among other key elements the history of copyright, the process of acquiring copyright, the scope and duration of copyright, the public domain, fair use, acquiring permission, and the Creative Commons.

DOC 150 - Introduction to Doc Storymaking

Students will study representative works from a variety of documentary approaches and learn to analyze the techniques of observation and representation at use in these pieces. Finally, students will become familiar with major theoretical constructions of documentary and be able to use these analytical tools to critique both historical and emergent documentary forms.  Students will complete several small documentary projects to be gathered in an e-portfolio to be further developed in the capstone.

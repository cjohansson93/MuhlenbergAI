In accordance with the Bylaws of the College, the Board of Trustees is entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility to maximize the mandated benefits to the student body (current as well as future), faculty, staff, and alumni. The Board recognizes its role as âthe responsible body for governing.â The Board understands its âprimary responsibilities are to provide leadership, effective governance and oversight, policy, and strategic direction.â Its governing role is not to micro-manage day-to-day activities but to spread âresponsibility and accountability while insisting on self-evaluation, participation, and performanceâ (2004 Governance Committee Final Report). Although the Board has final authority over the College, this authority is widely shared with the College President and with faculty, administrators, and to a lesser degree with students.
The maximum number of Trustees is fixed at 43. Each of the Bishops of the Northeastern Pennsylvania, Southeastern Pennsylvania and Slovak Zion Synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has one seat; three seats are held by individuals who are significantly involved as members of the ELCA, as determined by the Board in consultation with the ELCA Bishops; and a minimum of 60% of the seats are held by College alumni or alumnae. Trustees may serve up to four consecutive terms of three years each. The College President is an ex officio member of the Board but has no vote. The Board also appoints Trustees Emeriti, who have voice but no vote at meetings they attend.

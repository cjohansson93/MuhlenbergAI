Green Guides
Several guides are available to assist campus members in taking steps towards reducing our impact on the environment, decreasing resource use and educating ourselves about our interconnected, interdynamic world.
Students:
Muhlenberg students compiled a Guide to Student Sustainability at Muhlenberg (PDF Download) that suggests steps that can be taken here on campus. Please note: the recycling information since has changed!
Muhlenberg College has also identified Ten Sustainable Steps to making individual choices with an impact.
Staff & Faculty
There are several ways to reduce ecological impacts in a campus environment. Greening Campus Offices provides a preliminary list of environmentally responsible actions.
Additionally, the College offers several tips on how to Green Your Event.

boyle receives weikert award






Boyle and her parents accept the award from Nancy Weikert Tibbets, widow of Sidney Weikert.



Junior Lauren Boyle of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team received the Sidney G. Weikert Sophomore Athlete of the Year Award for her performance during the 2006-07 academic year.

The annual award, presented during halftime of the Homecoming football game, recognizes athletic achievement with accompanying campus contribution and 
strong academic record. It was established in 1973 by the Muhlenberg College Alumni Association in memory of the late Sidney G. Weikert, a loyal alumnus and former 
associate director of admissions at Muhlenberg. 

Boyle was the only sophomore named to the All-Centennial Conference first team in women’s basketball last year, earning the recognition after averaging 14.1 points
per game (second on the team and fifth in the CC). A Scotty Wood Tournament all-tournament selection and CC player of the week, she also earned a spot on the Academic
All-District second team and the CC Academic Honor Roll.

Boyle is averaging 12.3 points per game through her first two seasons, helping the Mules to a 45-10 record and the 2006 CC championship. She was the team’s leading scorer in three of four postseason games as a freshman

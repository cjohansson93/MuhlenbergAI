TURNOVERS HAUNT FOOTBALL
 




Senior Codie Bender became the fifth different Mule to lead the team in rushing in a game this season, gaining 40 yards on 12 carries.



Costly turnovers once again doomed the Muhlenberg football team, as all of Ursinus’ points came off Mule turnovers in a 24-10 victory for the Bears.

Ursinus (5-4, 5-2) booted a field goal and ran in a touchdown for its first two scores, which came after an interception and a fumble, respectively. But the Mules responded to each on their ensuing possessions. Trailing 3-0, freshman Dan Deighan hit senior Phil Cresta for a 55-yard strike down to the Ursinus 6. Junior Michael Katz converted a 22-yard field goal to tie the score.

After the Bears went back up, Muhlenberg (2-7, 1-6) responded again. Deighan found Cresta for gains of 12 and 30 yards on consecutive plays, setting the Mules up at the Ursinus 2. Freshman Terrence Dandridge ran in for the score on 2nd-and-goal, his team-leading third rushing touchdown of the season.

Muhlenberg would not be able to match Ursinus after that. With 5:23 to play in the first half the Bears returned a fumble 10 yards for a touchdown, then added a 36-yard touchdown pass two minutes into the second half. The Mules’ final five drives ended with two punts and three turnovers on downs.

Cresta once again starred for Muhlenberg on offense, catching 12 passes for 196 yards. He is the first Mule to catch at least 12 balls in a game since 1997 and just the third ever to accomplish the feat (two others did it twice each).

The defense played very well, holding Ursinus to 181 total yards and seven first downs. Senior Cameron Ahouse picked off two passes for the Mules, including one just outside the end zone. Junior Patrick McDonough led the team with eight tackles.

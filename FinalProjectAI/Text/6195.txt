Women's Basketball Falls to Blue Jays
 Monday, January 16, 2012







					 




For the second straight game, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team caught a cold at just the wrong time.

Despite holding Johns Hopkins to just five second-half field goals, the Mules did not shoot much better (27.3 percent after the break) as they dropped the rematch of last year’s Centennial Conference title game, 76-67.

The loss moves the Mules into a tie with the Blue Jays in the loss column for first place in the conference.

It was a one-possession game for the first 10 minutes before the Blue Jays (13-2, 8-2) started to slowly pull away. Hopkins fended off a late Mule rally to take a 10-point lead into the locker room.

The cushion grew to as many as 15 with 5:57 to play before Muhlenberg (12-2, 7-2) fired one final volley.

Senior Alexandra Chili knocked down a deep three to reduce the deficit to single digits with 1:31 remaining. Then junior Alita Zabrecky hit back-to-back treys, one from each wing, to make it a five-point game in the final minute.

But the Blue Jays hit seven of their last eight foul shots, and Muhlenberg turned the ball over twice in its final three possessions to close out the game.

Hopkins held a 47-27 advantage on the boards and shot 44 percent from the field, the highest shooting percentage for any Mule opponent this season, to hand Muhlenberg back-to-back home losses for the first time since early in the 2007-08 season.

Zabrecky finished with a game-high 22 points, seven rebounds and four steals. Chili added 18 points, and junior Kate Clawson and senior Kimberly Mui (right) added seven and six points, respectively.

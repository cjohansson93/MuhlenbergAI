Horizons, (2005 – 2007)is an installation of 12 life-size sculptures by Icelandic
artist, Steinunn Thorarinsdottir.  By sheer number the group, at first glance,
suggests a feeling of community.  More careful inspection soon reveals
strong elements of contemplation, melancholy, and isolation—the decidedly
more quiet and somber aspects of the human experience.
 
Jonathan Goodman, arts writer and instructor at Pratt Institute feels that
Thorarinsdottir’s sculpture reminds us that even though we often proceed in life
as if blinded by experience, it is that same experience that opens us to clarity—a
lucidity the artist literally embraces by embedding a thin horizontal strip of glass
in each cast-iron figure.
 
Thorarinsdottir has studied in England and Italy.  During the past 30 years she
has exhibited throughout Europe and the United States and her work is held by
collectors worldwide.  She has received numerous awards including the Order of
the Falcon by the President of Iceland in 2009.
 
Horizons inaugural installation in 2007 was out of doors at the Katonah
Museum of Art, Katonah, New York.  San Antonio, Texas and Manilow Sculpture
Park in Illinois were among other recent outdoor venues.  As a deliberate
departure from the format of previous installations, curator Scott Sherk, has
chosen to place Horizons inside the Martin Art Gallery.
 
Thorarinsdottir will present a talk, Tuesday, October 5, 7 – 8 p.m. in Recital
Hall, Baker Center for the Arts.   A reception for the artist will be held
Wednesday, Oct. 6, 4:30 – 6 p.m. in the Martin Art Gallery.  The exhibition,
reception, and talk are free and open to the public.  A complementary exhibition
that includes Thorarinsdottir’s two-dimensional work will be held in the Lachaise
Gallery, Cedar Crest College, October 4 – November 5.
 
The Martin Gallery is located in the Baker Center for the Arts, Muhlenberg
College, Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Gallery hours are: Tuesday through
Saturdays, noon – 8 p.m.; closed during major holidays and semester breaks.

Women's Soccer Wins Third Straight
 Friday, September 5, 2014 - page 2







					 




It became very clear during the first half of the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team’s 2-1 win over Delaware Valley that senior Colleen Touhey was destined for a goal. Her footwork was clean, her touches were meaningful and her play kept the pressure on the Aggies.  

Fittingly enough, with less than a minute left in the first half, the midfielder (right) curved a perfectly struck ball into the back of the net to give the Mules a 1-0 lead.

Much of the game was dominated by the Mules, who improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2008. Junior Nicole Karsch and senior Krissy Fioretti anchored a back line that quickly turned away any sniff of a meaningful attack and kept the pressure towards the middle and attacking parts of the field. 

Junior Taylor Pini benefitted from the forward movement and was able to attack the flanks early in the second half. With a shot much like Touhey’s, Pini lofted a well-hit ball from the top corner of the box to sail past the keeper and give the Mules a comfortable 2-0 lead, giving Pini her second goal in the last two games.

Sophomore Tori Gonzales recorded the win in her first career start in goal. She was called on to make only one save, but was able to smolder a few attacks in the box by getting to loose balls first.

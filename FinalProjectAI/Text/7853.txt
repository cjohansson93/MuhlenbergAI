Basketball Teams Swept at Johns Hopkins
 Saturday, December 6, 2014







					 




Both Muhlenberg basketball teams took a Centennial Conference loss at Johns Hopkins. The women fell 63-46 and the men lost 87-77.

The women’s team held an early lead against the Blue Jays, and senior Nicole Pepe scored 15 of the team’s 24 first-half points. Pepe was 4-for-6 from the field and 3-for-4 from behind the arc. Her 4-for-5 shooting from the foul line helped the Mules (3-4, 2-2) cut the lead to single digits headed into the half.

A steal by senior Hannah Rush led to a Pepe layup less than four minutes into the second half to bring Muhlenberg within three points at 35-32. Each team exchanged a free throw to make the score 36-33 before Johns Hopkins (5-2, 4-1) went on an 18-3 run and never looked back.



Pepe finished with a career-high 19 points, and senior Leanna Tallamy (left) notched her second straight double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.

The men (4-4, 0-3) showed a lot of fight down the stretch, keeping the game within shooting range, but could not overcome a late 18-point lead by the defending CC champion Blue Jays (5-2, 3-1). 

Four Mules reached double figures on the day. Freshman Owen McLeod led the way with a career-high 18 points and went 4-for-6 from three-point range. Senior Malique Killing poured in 17 points, going a perfect 8-8 from the free-throw line, and sophomore John Hunter added 12 points to his game-high nine rebounds. Sophomore Brandon LaRose (right) scored all 13 of his points (one short of his career high) in the first half. 

The Mules outscored Hopkins 44-43 in the second half and cut the lead to single digits on six occasions but could never get closer than eight points. They shot 54.5 percent from behind the arc in the second frame and went 21-for-25 from the line on the day.

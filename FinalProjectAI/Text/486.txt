Martin Art Gallery at Muhlenberg College presents: System Failure, a solo exhibition by interdisciplinary New York based artist Katya Grokhovsky, System Failure will be on view February 14th- through April 10th 2018, in the Baker Center for the Arts. An opening reception with the artist will be held on Wednesday February 14th from 5 â 6:30pm. Public performances  will take place at the gallery on Wednesday, March 14th and April 10th at 5pm. The artist will give a lecture on Wednesday March 21 5-6pm in the Recital Hall.
System Failure explores the complexities of failing patriarchal regime through immersive site-specific sculptural installation, video and performance. The exhibition investigates power and labor hierarchies that are the result of systemic oppression, greed and overconsumption. Against a backdrop of post-industrial debris, the invisible, absurd, grotesque and difficult aspects of contemporary female experience are explored.  System Failure acts as a lens that examines social norms through the politics of protest, whilst employing analysis, experimentation and exposure. Exploring the daily battlefields of domesticity, relationships, desire, anxiety, ambition and failure in the capitalist society, the exhibition offers a deconditioned and decolonized vision, through a feminist perspective.
Grokhovskyâs process based practice encompasses several mediums, including installation, performance, sculpture, video and painting, which she utilizes in order to explore ideas of gender, identity, alienation, and the self. She holds an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a BFA from Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne University, Australia and a BA (Honors) in Fashion from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia. Grokhovskyâs recent exhibitions include Smack Mellon, NYC, Equity Gallery, NYC, Center for Contemporary Arts, NM, EFA Project Space, NYC, San Francisco International Arts Festival, CA, Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, NY, Lesley Heller Workspace, NYC, HERE Arts Center, NYC, Amelie A. Wallace Gallery, SUNY College, NY among others. She is a recipient of numerous awards including The Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) Studios Program, BRICworkspace Residency, NYC, Wassaic Artist Residency, NY, Atlantic Center for the Arts, FL, Studios at MASS MoCA, MA, Santa Fe Art Institute Residency, NM, Watermill Center Residency, NY, Asylum Arts Grant, Dame Joan Sutherland Fund, Australia Council for the Arts ArtStart Grant, NYFA Mentoring Program for Immigrant Artists, Freedman Traveling Scholarship for Emerging Artists, Australia and others.

Teaching Interests
I teach courses on the Middle East, Europe, and in conflict and peace studies. My courses focus on the politics of identity, gender, nation building and the politics of protest and social movements.  I also teach courses in political ideologies including Islamism as radical political ideology and practice. I have taught courses on Turkey, which have included short-term study abroad experiences with students.
Research, Scholarship or Creative/Artistic InterestsMy research focuses on social movement politics and broadly on state-society relations. I have conducted specific research on the labor movement in Turkey as well as on Islamist politics in Turkey.  I also have done research projects on the Arab Spring and on the Islamic State that focus on applications of political theory. My current research examines gender in American conflict in the Middle East.

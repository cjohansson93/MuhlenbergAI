The Muhlenberg cross country teams have much to be optimistic about following their season-opening meet.



The Mule men came in third (second among five Division III teams) and the women sixth at the Lehigh Invitational.

Leading the men were the duo of sophomore Jaryd Flank and senior Luke Munyan, who placed 20th and 23rd, respectively, overall and second and third out of Division III competitors. Flank cut more than 37 seconds off his time in the same meet last year.

Senior Zach Lifman (right) was the third Muhlenberg runner across the finish line.

For the women, junior Melanie Tramontina was 19th overall and second among Division III runners with a 30-second improvement from last year. In their collegiate debuts, freshmen Alex Tendler and Mallory Snyder (left) were the second and third finishers for the Mules. Tendler was 26th overall and fourth in Division III.

The Muhlenberg field hockey team opened its season at home with a frustrating 1-0 loss to Scranton.

The Royals, coming off a 14-6 season, took control at the start and fired off four shots in the first 5:43, connecting on the
fourth to open up a 1-0 lead.

It was mostly Mules after that. Muhlenberg had advantages of 18-4 in shots and 16-6 in penalty corners in the final 63 minutes but could not manage to put the ball in the cage. Two balls got past the goalie but were swept away by backs.

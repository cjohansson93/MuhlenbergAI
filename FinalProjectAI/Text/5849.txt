Field Hockey Completes New York Sweep





Successful Start for Men’s Tennis


Freshmen John Osborne (No. 4) and Dan Zakheim (No. 6) both won their flights at the Muhlenberg Fall Classic, the first competition of the year for the Muhlenberg
men’s tennis team.

The tournament consisted of four-way competition among Muhlenberg, Moravian, Elizabethtown and Wilkes at each of six singles and three doubles spots. The Mules did well as a team,
winning their first-round match at all but one spot.

Last year, the Muhlenberg field hockey team didn’t pick up its second road win until the final week of the regular season. The 2007 team is well ahead of that pace.

A day after defeating Oneonta State, the Mules finished a 2-0 weekend in New York with a 2-1 win at Hartwick.

Muhlenberg (3-1) overcame the physical play of the Hawks (2-2) to score second-half goals by sophomore Kristen Sabia and senior Jillian Duffy. Hartwick scored with 43 seconds left to spoil the shutout bid.

Duffy’s goal, her third in as many games, gave her an even 50 points for her career.

Ethics Series At Muhlenberg Kicks Off With Panel Discussion



Muhlenberg College faculty members will kick off the opening event for the series, The Ethics and Politics of Identity, sponsored by the Collegeâs Center for Ethics on Thursday, September 1 at 7 p.m. in Miller Forum, Moyer Hall. 


	 Friday, August 26, 2005  01:59 PM

Professors will present selections from the concert videos of comedian Margaret Cho and introduce the Center's major questions for the year in "Recognition, Representation, and the Ethics and Politics of Identity: An Exploration Focusing on the Comic Identity of Margaret Cho." This event is free and open to the public. A reception will follow the viewing and discussion. 
A Korean-American queer-friendly artist, Cho points up the hilarious complications of individuality. Her provocative stand-up acts raise questions about how certain identities get to be “normal?” As Cho teases us into seeing, the strict parameters of normal guarantee that others become “abnormal”– these categorizations define and limit individuals and groups grappling with society’s socio-economic and cultural strictures around class, race, gender and sexual identification.
Beth Schachter, program director for the series, will introduce the event. Faculty participating in a panel discussion will be: Charles Anderson, dance; Janine Chi, sociology; Troy Dwyer, theatre; Jeff Pooley, communication; and Jeremy Teissere, biology.
 The Ethics and Politics of Identity is a year long series of programs, sponsored by the Muhlenberg College Center for Ethics, about the ethical challenges that surround the changing categories of social, national, and global identities.

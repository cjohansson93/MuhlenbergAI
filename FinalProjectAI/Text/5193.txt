track teams run with the ’hounds



The Muhlenberg track and field teams took advantage of their first meet with nice weather to combine for seven ECAC qualifiers at the Greyhound Invitational. The large meet hosted by Moravian featured Division I athletes from schools such as Temple, Lafayette and Lehigh as well as non-collegiate competitors.

Seniors Stuart Udis and David Chorney

won the 800 and 1,500 meters, respectively. Udis’ time of 1:53.08 just missed the NCAA provisional mark of 1:53.00 and wasn’t far off the meet record of 1:52.84.

Junior Brendan Kirk (left) qualified for ECACs in three events: individually in the 400 intermediate hurdles and as part of the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. The 4x400 posted the fourth-fastest time in school history.

The women also enjoyed success in the relays, with the 4x100 running the second-fastest time in school program. At right, freshman Jenna Schaffer hands off to senior Lucy Brock.

Junior Jennifer Lynch placed second in the 1,500 with an ECAC-qualifying time.

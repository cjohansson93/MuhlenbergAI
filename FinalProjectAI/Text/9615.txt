Drew Maidment â18 snaps his fingers, and lights shine down upon the seats inside the Trexler Pavilion Studio Theatre. He and the Sedehi Diversity Projectâs six other student actors stand from their places in the audience and introduce the first segment of this yearâs performance in unison: "November 8, 2016. Election Night."
One by one, each of them delivers a line or two, pulled from confidential interviews with Muhlenberg community members, before descending to the stage and taking their places atop small black boxes.
Every member of Muhlenbergâs Class of 2021 will see the performance that follows as part of Orientation Weekend. The Sedehi Diversity Project (SDP), named after founder DesirÃ©e Sedehi â08, produces a new show each year, with oversight from faculty advisor Troy Dwyer, associate professor of theatre & dance.
The students behind the Project interview peers, faculty and staff of different backgrounds to compile a script thatâs organized around several themes. This yearâs show opens with a segment on the effect of Donald Trumpâs election at Muhlenberg, and it goes on to address accessibility, gender, race and a variety of other topics that multiple interviewees chose to talk about.
"It gives a voice to queer students, students of color, students that are in the minorityâit gives them a space,â says Mikaela Esposito â19, SDPâs project manager. âAnd, it helps the freshmen students who are part of those minority groups to feel more comfortable here. Weâre encouraging the freshmen to face experiences theyâre not familiar with and to let them know, âWeâre excited for you to go on this journey with us.'"

SDPâs director, Bree Booth â19, acknowledges that the show can be intense and sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but thatâs part of its power.
âI hope that students are moved by it and want to continue these conversations,â she says. The goal is to generate an honest discussionâamong first-year students, returning students and Muhlenberg faculty and staffâabout how to foster a welcoming, diverse community.
Ensemble member John Smith â19 remembers the effect of the SDP performance he saw when he was a first-year student: âPeople were still talking about it weeks and months and years later.â
Thatâs what inspired him to audition for the show last year and, when he didnât make the cut, to try out again this year. The challenge, he says, is to embody the words youâre performingâeven when they donât reflect your personal beliefs or opinions.
âYouâre not just connecting with the audience,â John says. âYouâre digging your hands into the life force of the students at Muhlenberg.â
While first-year students are the primary intended audience, the performance at 9 p.m. on Sunday, August 27, is open to Muhlenberg faculty, staff and returning studentsâand that tends to be the most interactive performance.
"When you have faculty and staff members showing up to learn a thing or two from students, that's a great thing for a college community," Dwyer says.

Summer 2019







Abigail Dodds, â20
I interned this summer at the Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia in the Center for Healthcare Quality and Analytics. I have had the opportunity to be a part of several improvement projects focusing in patient safety across the hospital within several different units including the Emergency Department(ED), Oral Surgery, and the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit(CICU). Working with improvement advisors, doctors, nurses, and CHOP executives has allowed me to understand the scope of operations and quality improvement in a hospital setting working towards safety and success for all patients.









Michael Rainone, â20
For the Summer of 2019, I interned with NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, NY. NYU Winthrop Hospital, an affiliate of NYU Langone Health, provides inpatient and outpatient pediatric, adult, and geriatric medical care through an extensive network of Long Island healthcare facilities. I worked under the Department of Surgical Services and the Department of Medical Staff Services. The Department of Surgical Services aspires to soundly and efficiently operate TCV, Urology, Ophthalmology, and ENT services. The Department of Medical Staff Services is responsible for credentialing physicians and other healthcare professionals (often referred to as privileges), resolving issues and complaints, ensuring healthcare providers adhere to quality regulations and policies, and maintaining credentials. I was fortunate enough to delve into the âbehind the scenesâ public health work, whether it was listening in on conference calls, learning new software such as Alpha, IntelleChart, Cactus, or EPIC, or even speaking to clients over the phone. Public Health comes in many shapes and forms, and Public Health credentialing and management proved to be truly interesting.









 

Madison Forrest, â20
I interned at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in their Trauma Department as a Pediatric Injury Prevention Scholar (PIPS) intern. The number one cause of death for children ages 1-14 is unintended injuries - these include car and pedestrian crashes, accidental drownings and falls. My team works to educate the community on how to prevent these injuries and keep children safe. I'm a certified child passenger safety technician (CPST)  and participated in car seat check events across the greater Los Angeles area. 3 out of 4 car seats are installed improperly, so I inspect the car seat and show the parent/caregiver how it should be installed. If they come to one of our events with an expired or damaged car seat or no car seat at all, we provide a new one at no cost. 
My personal project for the summer was sports safety. I developed a curriculum to teach elementary school-aged children how to protect their bodies when they participate in sports And I ran booths at local tournaments that educated middle/high school aged kids, their parents and coaches on the dangers of sports-related concussions - how to recognize it in themselves or a someone else, and how to report it. 









Emma Charron, â20
This past summer I was a research assistant at Connecticut Childrenâs Medical Center. I worked under a current medical student at the University of Connecticut and assisted in screening and enrolling patients for a study observing current adolescents perspectives on sexual health education. I had the opportunity to approach patients who fit the studyâs criteria within the pediatric emergency department and gather data for those who assented. In addition, I was able to shadow residents in the emergency department as well as a nurse practitioner in the neonatal intensive care unit. I am very grateful for this amazing opportunity!













Brooke Greenberg, â21
So, this summer, I was a research intern at the Children's Hospital of Philadephia in the Department of Rheumatology, specifically working in the Center for Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndromes. While I was there, I not only conducted a self-designed research project, that will continue through the school year. For the project, I had to obtain IRB approval, but I also got to spend time shadowing in various clinics, attending different research meetings and lectures around the CHOP/PENN campus. I got to learn many different research skills including data abstraction, and IRB writing. I am so grateful to have had this experience which was able to help me further develop critical research skills, but also to intern in a place that I care so deeply about.









Hadar Re'em, â21
This past summer I had the opportunity to participate in the Research Scholars program at Lehigh Valley Health Network. I worked in the Department of Family Medicine on mixed methods explorations of barriers to both mammography completion and lung cancer screening completion within Lehigh Valley Physicians Group primary care practices. I conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on multiple quality improvement projects, attended weekly professional development workshops, and expanded upon various skillsets. I gained a deeper understanding of the social determinants of health and their impact on clinical care through real world application, as well as a greater appreciation for research and quality improvement studies.













Grace Duah, â20
This summer I worked on a collaborative Research Undergraduate Experience (REU) with Davidson College, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Johnson C. Smith University and the Mecklenburg County Health Department. My research looked specifically at medical mistrust from the black community towards Mecklenburg County. This research followed a series of scandals which included the mishandling of reports and the county health department failing to inform an under-resourced population of abnormalities in their cervical cancer screening, which contributed to a long history of neglect and unethical medical practices towards the African American community. More specifically, I worked on an intervention strategy which partnered Public Health with Faith-Placed Organizations.









Rashida Haye, â20
This summer, I interned at Hackensack University Medical Center (the flagship hospital of the Hackensack Meridian Health network). I worked specifically with a program called Accountable Health Communities, and my role primarily involved screening patients for health-related social needs (HRSN). The AHC program is funded through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, so I visited different parts of the hospital every day to administer the Screening Tool and identify if these beneficiaries had any needs in the following areas: Housing; Food Assistance; Transportation Assistance; Utility Needs; Interpersonal Violence. Once any of these needs were identified, we would give the patient a community referral summary with a list of organizations in their neighborhood that would assist them for free or for very low cost. While navigating the hospital, I learned how to administer the screening in different locations, including the John Theurer Cancer Center and the Outpatient & Behavioral Health Center. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to conduct in depth personal interviews with patients who became permanent cases under the program, and on my last day, I accompanied one of my supervisors on a home visit. This internship very much solidified my interest in addressing social determinants of health and bridging the gap between hospital care and community services.

Brynn Cardonick, â21
This summer, I interned at Merck in their Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM) department. My main focus was physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. PBPK models are basically giant flow charts that show how drugs are moved throughout the body and in which medium they do so. I completed a literature review of PBPK models of the central nervous system reading primary research articles and summarized the models included, focusing on which drugs were experimented with and how many of them passed through the blood brain barrier. I also did a smaller literature search for pharmacodynamic data on drugs used for bunionectomies and the success rates of each. I then had the opportunity to use a program called Simcyp, a computer software that models preclinical studies for drug discovery and development. The software creates simulations allowing the researcher to choose the age, gender, health status, and number of participants that are provided with the drug. The goal of these simulations is to one day replace real-life preclinical studies with computer simulations that can provide the same information while also using less time and money.









Esther Schlossberg, â20
This summer I worked as an intern at the Connecticut Department of Public Health in the Office of Injury Prevention and Prescription Drug Overdose Prevention Program. During this internship, I worked on a variety of projects dealing with injury prevention, the opioid epidemic, and falls prevention. The first project I worked on was the creation of an Opioid Overdose app specific to the State of Connecticut. The goal of this app is to offer information to people who might be connected to someone who uses opiates, either through a personal connection or through employment. If someone is with a person who might be experiencing an overdose, they can use the app to follow the steps to help save someoneâs life, including the different ways to administer Naloxone. The app can also be used for informational purposes. Additionally, I worked closely with an epidemiologist, during another project, where I imported and updated suicide and homicide data for the 2016 year on the National Violent Death Reporting System, on the CDC website for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Another project I assisted with was the beginning stages of composing a compendium of Falls Prevention resources throughout the State of Connecticut. The hope is that older adults will use this compendium if they have any questions or concerns about Falls Prevention across the state. Lastly, I created a Voluntary Non-Opioid Directive pamphlet that will be distributed across doctorâs offices across the state to explain to people that they can have a written directive in their doctorâs office regarding not wanting to be prescribed opioids for any reason. I really enjoyed my time interning and worked on countless other projects relating to injury prevention overall. My interests within injury prevention and opioid overdose prevention have greatly increased. After my experience with the Connecticut Department of Public Health, I know in the future I want to follow this career path.











Jessica Wise, â19
This past summer I interned for the Lower Hudson Valley Perinatal Network, a non-profit organization that advocates for maternal, child and family health. LHVPNâs work is devoted to neighborhoods in Rockland and Westchester Counties that are predominately African American, Haitian, and Hispanic immigrants. Perinatal health pertains to the health of a mother and her baby immediately before and after birth. Research shows that minority populations, such as the ones listed, have higher rates of premature death and low birth weight infants, therefore LHVPN educates pregnant mothers or parents of child-bearing age about the importance of perinatal health. It strives to connect uninsured families to health insurance so they can work closely with a prenatal doctor, in addition to educating families about healthy eating, exercise, and other essential aspects of living a healthy lifestyle. As a community health intern, I conducted research and worked with community members. The other interns and I traveled to Mt. Vernon, New Rochelle, and Yonkers, where we spoke to community members about prevalent issues pertaining to health insurance and barriers to living a healthy lifestyle. Those who were willing to engage in conversation were asked to participate in a survey that will be used to evaluate the problems in these neighborhoods and work towards bringing change. Overall this experience taught me to appreciate the community I was raised in and made me aware of how minorities face disparities in health.









Lauren Fisher, â19
This summer I interned for Heather Clark, Vice President for Medical Academic and Research Operations at the Bethlehem campus St. Luke's University Health Network. During this internship, I have attended administrative meetings, collaborated with employees and conducted a bit of informal research. This internship was based around exposing myself to the mix of hospital administration and law and how they interact. This was very apparent in the meetings I attended and the discussion of the future of hospital expansion. In addition, I was tasked with finding the policies under ACGME requirements in relation to scholarly activity for an abundance of specialties. Also, I helped create ideas to combat the shortage of primary care doctors. Many of the primary care doctors will be retiring within the next coming years, yet there is not enough of them to fill the void, therefore a big part of my internship was to come up with ideas to attract more primary care doctors.











Leah Santacroce, â19
This past summer I completed an internship at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation on Long Island. I worked in the Water Department and their main focus was on saltwater intrusion in wells and contamination from geothermal wells. Geothermal wells can pose a threat to drinking water for a number of reasons, but mainly because a heat transfer fluid is circulated through the system which can leak into the aquifer and pollute the drinking water. My task at the DEC was to go through both recent and historical geothermal well permits and map them onto the DEC's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) map. If any problem areas of pollution arise, the DEC members can use the GIS map to identify which wells could be the problem and subsequently remediate. This internship allowed me to use a public health and environmental science tool, GIS, and apply it to a problem that is affecting people in the area I grew up in.









Maayan Malomet, â20
This summer, I interned and shadowed an occupational therapist at the Aleh Negev Rehabilitation Village in Southern Israel. Aleh Negev is a multifaceted facility that provides care for disabled ages 1-50, while also giving these individuals the ability to live in a safe and productive environment. I worked alongside a staff that had a mixof Arabic speaking and Hebrew speaking Israelis and I was able to use my fluency in Hebrew and beginner Arabic to create meaningful unifying relationships despite being in a place of conflict. As an occupational therapy shadow and intern I observed and helped disabled children learn to walk, speak, and improve movement in their hands through motivational games. I also got extensive exposure to hydrotherapy and horse therapy. One of my patients gave back to the village by caring and feeding horses during horse therapy. It was very moving and eye opening to see my residents and patients reach their potentials.











Madison Forrest, â20
I interned at the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region in their Disaster Relief Services. This summer was predicted to be disaster heavy: with the volcano eruption in Hawaii, hurricane season in the South, floods in the Northeast, tornados in the Midwest, and wildfires in California - in addition to the number one most destructive disaster in America, home fires.
Within the Disaster Services, I worked closely with workforce engagement. Response to a disaster begins long before the actual event occurs. Being prepared starts during what we call 'Blue Skies'(a disaster-free time) which entails finding and engaging with volunteers who are willing to donate their time to respond to disasters locally, regionally, or nationally.
We hosted a really big event, "Sound the Alarm", where we installed smoke alarms in fire-vulnerable areas for free and discussed preventative measures regarding the importance of home fire safety - being prepared in case of a fire - having an escape plan, duplicating important documents, etc. So far, the Red Cross has installed more than a million smoke alarms across the country!Hopefully nothing horrible happens in my community or somewhere else across the country; but if it does, I know the Red Cross is prepared with the people I enlisted, who are willing to step-up and provide aid through running evacuations and shelters, delivering medicinal supplies and food, mental health services, and a variety of other ways volunteers respond to disasters.









Melissa Klein, â19
This summer, I had the opportunity to work at the National Football League (NFL) Headquarters in New York City. There, I worked with the Player Health and Safety Department on the new initiatives and rules that will be implemented in the upcoming football season. Throughout my 10 week experience, I worked on video replay analysis to determine injury trends, learned about the engineering behind the making of helmets, protective equipment, and artificial turf fields, met with some of the country's most renowned engineers, data analysts, and epidemiologists, and was even flown out to Chicago for the annual National Football League Medical Summit. In Chicago, I met each team's physicians, unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants, athletic trainers, and even owners, and was able to hear their feedback on the newest safety regulations that have been put into place. My Public Health and Science studies at Muhlenberg prepared me so well for this internship. I am so thankful to have had such an incredible opportunity and have never felt so humbled.

Over this past summer, I was part of the White House Internship Program. I am beyond thankful for this eye-opening and wonderful experience. I learned how to be a professional inside and outside of work. This experience also helped me figure out my professional goals for the near future. The White House team was so supportive, and I am blessed to have been part of the team for the summer. If it weren't for my parents, my prior bosses, Dr. Cronin, Tom Dowd, Dr. Slane, and Dr. Herrick, this experience would not have been possible. This summer was extraordinary, and I am very grateful.

Ashley Lafferty
Over the summer I had the opportunity to be an intern at the Princeton Health Department in Princeton, NJ. The main purpose for my internship was to help prepare the staff and get the department ready for when the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) visits. I was assisting the Princeton Health Department for a Public Health Accreditation site visit in the following months. I was in charge of creating a preparation plan for the Department. PHABâs public health department accreditation process seeks to advance quality and performance within public health departments. Accreditation standards define the expectations for all public health departments that seek to become accredited. I would prepare PowerPoints weekly for the staff and present them in meetings so that the staff was being educated on the process of accreditation. The other jobs I had was to make checklists for the department, prepare letters to send to our community partners, and governing body. I also prepared questions that PHAB may ask the staff upon arrival as well as I prepared questions for our governing body, including preparing questions for our community partners. In addition to preparing the community partners and governing body, I also had to inform the staff on important documents that PHAB would be specifically looking at such as the Community Health Assessment (CHA), Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), and Quality Improvement Plan (QI), just to name a few.  I learned a lot from my time at the health department. Learning about how long the process is for a health department to get accredited was extremely interesting to be a part of. Iâm glad I could have this opportunity. This internship has been an amazing opportunity to learn how a health department works daily involving public health issues.









Peninah Ingabire
Over the summer, I interned with Rwanda Biomedical Center in Kigali, Rwanda. RBC is the implementing branch of the Rwandan ministry of health; It has multiple divisions but I interned within the maternal, child and community health department. The work at RBC is divided between office work and field work, however, the biggest part of my internship was field work. My work revolved around the vaccination unit, community health unit and health facilities unit. Throughout this summer, I was able to work through different projects such as monitoring and evaluating different health centers in different districts around Rwanda, following up on the cold chain supply within vaccination centers and other vaccination storages, following up on the nationwide hepatitis vaccination campaign, and training community health workers around the country on family planning and neo-natal care. Additionally, I also had the opportunity to attend different training and meetings on health campaigns and projects through partners such as WHO, UNICEF and JHpiego. This was an amazing opportunity for me because it was a glimpse of what I could do as a career. After graduation, I plan to apply the knowledge I have learnt and make an impactful change in maternal and child health care.











Danya Greenberg
This summer I had the privilege of interning for Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA). PANA is dedicated to the inclusion of refugees through the lens of public policy.  While there are many existing organizations that provide services for refugees (food, clothing, etc), PANA focuses on developing and fighting for policy that integrates refugees on an institutional level, including them into very fabric of society.  This organization is centered in my home town (San Diego, California) so I learned more about my community, the peopleâs needs, and local politics.  As a Public Health and Political Science double major, this organization was the perfect way to merge my studies and passions, and observe the intersection of health and policy.  I spearheaded social media, which required lots of research and learning about refugee struggles, the importance of affordable housing, the necessity to speak English in order to advocate for your needs, perceptions of refugees, and much more.  Most importantly, this experience reaffirmed my love for refugee work, my passion for public health, the importance for meaningful policy, and the potential for change when people come together.









Ilise Posner
This summer I interned at the Montgomery County Health Department in Norristown, Pennsylvania in the Division of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. The Montgomery County Health Department provides surveillance, control and prevention of 74 reportable diseases and conditions. Using PA-NEDDS, I took cases following up with patients and providers regarding sexually transmitted diseases, Lyme disease, gastro-enterics, and rabies control. I was able to work alongside my co-workers as a Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) on the communicable disease team. I also worked on a project to create an eye-catching and informative Tick and Lyme Disease flyer which was posted on all of the trail systems in Montgomery County. The flyer was shared on their website as well as on the countyâs social media platforms. This was something I was very proud to have created as it was met with positive feedback. Using my creative eye, I created educational materials for National HIV Testing Day, Sexual Health Awareness Month, and two different sexual health outreach days. For National HIV Testing Day, I developed a social media post schedule for the countyâs Facebook and Twitter page along with a flyer for the county to use. Another assignment I worked on was an influenza data clean-up project. I had to go through influenza cases from this past flu season using PA-NEDDS and Epi Info, a CDC database. I then had to determine if it was a probably, suspect, or confirmed influenza case. With my co-workers I had the opportunity to attended a health fair where we represented Montgomery County Health Department and I attended a Zika conference in Philadelphia. This internship allowed me to develop more personal and professional confidence while giving me the knowledge to more specifically guide my future public health endeavors.











Stef Caplan
Over the summer, I interned for United States Congressman Tom MacArthur and New Jersey State Senator Dawn Marie Addiego. For Congressman MacArthur, I researched agent orange in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the pinelands pipeline, and the effects radiation had on military dental technicians in 1970. I also summarized numerous bills and laws. In addition, I responded to concerned constituents regarding various issues. Senator Addiego gave me the opportunity to attend voting sessions and the state budget hearing at the State House in Trenton. She also invited me to numerous political events. At Senator Addiegoâs office, I handled constituent affairs and bill comments. Both of my internships this summer gave me a hands-on experience as well as the chance to network. I was able to participate in the behind the scenes work on both federal and state levels. As a double major in Political Science and Public Health with a minor in Mathematics, I am grateful for these internships and the opportunity to work in my fields of study.









Rachel Plotke
Thanks to Muhlenbergâs Office of Community Engagement Internship Program, I spent my summer right here in Allentown working as the Health Center Advocacy Program (HCAP) intern for Planned Parenthood Keystone. As the advocacy intern, I had the opportunity to engage with patients in the health center every week, talking with them about how to better get involved in advocacy work through volunteering and sharing their story. In addition to my time spent in the health center, I coordinated several events such as phonebanks and canvasses. My internship with Planned Parenthood allowed me to explore Allentown in a way I had never done before. I met and worked with various community members and organizations in the Lehigh Valley, promoting Planned Parenthoodâs work while also coordinating efforts for their own causes. Near the end of my internship, we even took a bus down to D.C. to rally for Planned Parenthood and fight the proposed health care bill that would âdefundâ Planned Parenthood. Overall, it was a great summer and an amazing learning experience!











Rachel Rochelson
I spent my summer interning at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield with the Workplace Wellness and Telemedicine team. Excellus BCBS is a health plan company that employs nearly 800 people in Syracuse, NY. After completing the Occupational Health and Business in Society courses as part of my cluster sophomore year, this internship provided me with an excellent opportunity to understand public health from a business perspective. The Workplace Wellness and Telemedicine Team primarily collaborates with employer groups (companies who are insurance plan subscribers) looking to promote health and wellness programs to their employees. In just 10 weeks, I was able to assist with a multitude of projects, connect with people throughout many different departments, and even work with a team of interns to complete and deliver a capstone presentation to a cohort of senior leaders including the corporationâs CEO. I had the opportunity to contribute to employee wellness programs in many different ways. Whether I was compiling competitive intelligence information, learning about new fitness tools, trackers, and apps, mapping out healthcare shortage areas from data sets, or networking with professionals, this internship was truly an outstanding experience.









Lindsey Sharp
My name is Lindsey Sharp, and I am a senior double majoring in dance and public health. This summer I was a research intern for Aon Health.  I was working closely with the public health department of the company on the subject of genomics.  This topic is growing in popularity among insurance companies as well as the general public.  There are companies like â23 And Meâ that offer direct to consumer genetic and genomic testing to provide ancestral information and potential future health risks based on their genetic make-up.  My job was to seek out and organize any research done on the facts, benefits, costs, and economic efficiency of genomic testing.  This was then put into both a fact sheet and a WebEx presentation to be distributed to consultants of Aon Health, so that Aon as a company is able to provide correct and useful information to companies looking to insure their employees who are wondering if genomic testing is a worthwhile investment.  My work was very collaborative, and I worked side by side with my three supervisors to put together what we collectively discovered, and to talk through the implications of what we couldnât find.  This was a very beneficial experience that allowed me to work both on site, and remotely with representatives of a global company that is continually working toward a well-rounded base of knowledge to relay when helping companies like Verizon to provide the appropriate health insurance plans for its employees all around the country.

Over the summer (and currently) I worked with Habitat for Humanity of Lehigh Valley (HFHLV).  The main purpose for interning with HFHLV is to get closer to the people in the community; understand their needs, wants, and focusing on educating them on available resources.  Another important aspect of my internship was to do surveys in the Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton to find out what issues arise in the homes, outside the homes, in their communities, health issues, and threats in their communities as well.  This internship is very important to me as a whole.  Having to put yourself in an environment where people donât trust or believe that the system would work for them in any aspect of their lives or their familiesâ lives.  This can only get better, if the people believe in what HFHLV can do to provide for each family.  The main purpose is to have a better opportunity to live in a new home, have security for the families, to be able go to a better school, meet like-minded people within their new communities, having to do Neighborhood Revitalization!  Habitat affiliates are not the architects of revitalization.  Instead, they tailor their work to the aspirations and dreams of residents who take on leadership roles in their communityâs renewal.  NR also relies on partners such as churches, businesses, civic groups and neighborhood associates.  Neighborhood Revitalization helps fulfill Habitatâs mission.  âSeeking to put Godâs love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope.â









Mahi Mesfin
Over the summer I had the opportunity to be an Intern at the UN indigenous tribe conference. It was an amazing experience as we were given the chance to interact and network with representatives from around the world. My job was basically to sit in on the conferences and take notes on the complaints, observations, and suggestions these representatives had in regards to their specific indigenous communities. These notes would then be documented by DOCIP. I was also expected to reach out to the representatives after they had made their statements and ask for any documents they had for us, allowing me to practice my Spanish. Once our day was over we were given access to the delegate dinning room where we were able to sit and eat with some amazing people who held great power in the UN. I hope to one day pursue a Job in the UN so this was an amazing opportunity to network and experience the inner workings of the UN!

I spent my summer at Crouse Hospital in Syracuse, NY. My experience was unique in that I was able to gain a better understanding of public health in a hospital setting. By assisting with projects related to employee health and wellness, meeting with several key people working in various departments, and shadowing members of the Care Coordination Department (specialty social workers) throughout several units of the hospital, I had the opportunity to explore today's healthcare system. Witnessing firsthand the challenges associated with providing high quality care to patients while working simultaneously with family members to develop long term care plans are just a few of the roles Crouseâs Care Coordination Department fulfills. Among many other things, the department is responsible for arranging patient transportation from the hospital and works closely with medical rehabilitation centers, nursing homes and home healthcare assistance services in the area as well as substance rehabilitation centers, local shelters, community centers, etc. During my time at Crouse, I learned a lot about Central New Yorkâs organizations that offer public assistance programs to the communityâs special populations, some of which included people living in poverty, the elderly, people with disabilities, mental health, substance abuse issues and refugees. One of the most notable experiences I had was the opportunity to sit in on a âLength of Stayâ meeting where extended-stay patient cases were reviewed in an effort to ensure those patients were continuing to receive care while focusing on their long-term prognosis and discharge planning. Participating in meetings like this one helped me to identify a completely new array of public health issues I wouldnât have otherwise considered.









Emily Sachs
I work as a clinical research assistant for Dr. Jennifer Walter, a professor at UPenn and an employee at the Childrenâs Hospital of âPhiladelphia (CHOP). The main research project I am working on for her is being conducted in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and is called âCommunication Skills Training for Interprofessional Teams in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.â In the CICU, many parents describe obtaining a realistic understanding that their child had a life-limiting disease only two days prior to death. CICU attendings must have the skills to support parental decision-making, including giving bad news and eliciting parental goals for their child. Our goal is to develop a communication skills training program for interprofessional teams to try and increase empathetic and effective communication during family meetings. This study is relevant because lack of effective communication is a public health issue which can lead to negative outcomes for millions of patients/families. My responsibilities include administering surveys and informed consent forms to participants, conducting literature reviews, writing papers, and data analysis. I also attend Palliative Advanced Care Team (PACT) meetings and Ethics Committee meetings. This internship has allowed me to gain increased exposure and confidence in working with professionals from different disciplines, research skill acquisition and academic paper writing skills. I am double majoring in bioethics and public health and am planning to attend law school since I am interested in health law. This internship has been an amazing opportunity to learn more about the public health and ethical issues involved in the medical system and I am excited to continue this research.

This past summer I was the Health Promotion Intern at the National Health Promotion Associates (NHPA) in Westchester, New York. During this internship I worked closely with the research team on several projects. Two projects were, with the United States Airforce Academy (USAFA) and Youth Courts. These projects resulted in improving the communication, life skills, and health curriculum given to the students.The third project was called, Middle School Prescription Drug Abuse (prevention). Here, we were in the process of creating a new program on prescription drug abuse for middle-school-aged youth to learn about what prescription drugs are, and what happens if they are misused. For these projects I assisted in data entry and analysis for several of the pre and post-tests given to the students. I did additional research about prescription drug abuse within middle school students and wrote a blog posted on the Botvin LifeSkills website. It was interesting comparing and contrasting several areas of Public Health. I serve as the Nutrition and Culinary Intern at Muhlenberg College thus, I was never given the experience to work within different fields of Public Health until this summer. My interests within alcohol/drug abuse prevention, bullying, communication skills, and sexual assault prevention have greatly increased. After my experience at NHPA I was able to solidify my passion for Public Health and be confident that this is the career path I want to follow.

This summer I was a data management intern with the Viral Hepatitis Program at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. During my internship I helped the epidemiologists manage cases, death certificates, and worked with data in Philadelphiaâs online communicable disease database. I also worked and attended meetings with various programs throughout the Department of Public Health, including the Immunizations Division, Sexually Transmitted Disease Program, and the Public Health Preparedness Division.

Over the summer I had a two monthsâ internship with the World Health Organization (WHO) which I conducted with the representative office for Rwanda. I was working inââ the Health Promotion Unit which mainly enhances health communication and promotes community health. The WHO Rwanda office works closely with the Rwandan Ministry of Health by supporting and advising health officials on the key health priorities. During the first half of my internship, I learned different ways in which the health information is being passed to the Rwandan population. I was fortunate enough to be part of the committee that prepared the International Scientific Conference on Non-Communicable Diseases which took place in Kigali, Rwanda in June 2016. I learned how to review all the promotion materials so that the event can reach a great number of Rwanda. The second half of the internship was mainly field works and I went to three different districts to learn the system of community health in Rwanda. There is a decentralized network of community health workers and the big part of their job is to reduce child and maternal deaths. Community health workers do their job by monitoring pregnant women and newborns and assist them to get efficient prenatal and neonatal care. Interning with WHO gave an opportunity to work with other health agencies in Rwanda and therefore learn more about Public Health in Rwanda. In addition, I was able to know how Rwanda is working to achieve international health goals such as the ones listed in the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to my internship, as a public health student, it was an honor to represent my country in the African Union Summit and give a speech about the cultural sensitivity about sexual and reproductive education in Rwanda.

In conjunction with the internship program at Muhlenberg College, I worked at the Rockland County, New York Department of Health during the summer of 2015. My mentor for this experience was Professor Chrysan Cronin. My internship began with rotations through each of nine Health Department divisions, attending meetings and shadowing doctors and nurses. I spent the majority of the summer working with the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program and the Department of Disease Control.  With guidance from the Directors of Disease Control and WIC, I designed and conducted a study to characterize sources of discrepancies in WIC clinic immunization records. To accomplish this, I administered an immunization survey to the parents of children being seen in WIC clinics and compared the findings to the vaccination records in New York Stateâs official immunization database (NYSIIS).  At the end of my internship, I presented the results of the study to professionals at the Health Department who enthusiastically endorsed continuing the study on a larger scale. This was an incredibly valuable experience for me and served to solidify my interests in Public Health.

This past summer I completed an internship with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with their Infection Prevention and Control team. For those who may not be familiar with IPC they are the section of the hospital that monitors hospital acquired infections and any other means of cross contamination. Part of their job is educating staff and patients on transmission of diseases and how to properly reduce transmission in the hospital setting (for example, with PPE or correct hand washing). Another responsibility is recognizing HAI's (hospital acquired infections) in patients and investigating these cases. The definition of an HAI is an infection that is acquired after a patient has been admitted into the hospital. It it sometimes difficult to tell if a patient has come to the hospital with a certain illness or they acquired it post admittance, therefore the IPC team relies on accurate surveillance from the doctors and nurses of symptoms and signs present at admittance to assess these cases. Through this internship, I was able to utilize experiences and knowledge from my public health courses and it really put meaning behind everything I've learned. It's one thing to read about something in a textbook and then be tested on it, but it's a whole new feeling when you can actually see what's happening in a real world setting and then put all that knowledge to the real test. It sounds scary right? But when you work as a team, like CHOP's IPC team, you make up for each others weakness and together are a strong unit making a difference in peoples lives every single day. I aspire to be part of this amazing field some day and continue to create a healthier future.

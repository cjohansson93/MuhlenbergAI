Muhlenberg freshman Daniel Eidman was named men’s golf athlete of the week by the Centennial Conference.

Eidman shot in the 70s in the first three rounds of his college career. He tied for fourth with a 4-over-par 76 
to help Muhlenberg win the Moravian Invitational, and he followed that up with team-best rounds of 78 and 79 at 
the Guy W. Kuhn Invitational.

Eidman is the first Mule freshman in four years to begin his career with three sub-80 rounds.

Two of Eidman’s teammates competed at the Gettysburg Fall Invitational. Sophomore John Froberg shot an 81.

liddic namedplayer of the week


For the second time in his career, junior Spencer Liddic of the Muhlenberg men's basketball team was named player of the week by the
Centennial Conference.

Liddic averaged 25.3 points and 10.3 rebounds, while shooting 65.9 percent from the floor, as the Mules went 3-0 last week. He opened the season with a
23-point, 11-rebound performance in a 68-60 win against Moravian, scoring nine points in the final 10:01 to lead Muhlenberg back from an 11-point deficit.

In the Scotty Wood Tournament, Liddic scored 21 points in only 26 minutes against Rosemont, then poured in a career-high 32 points to go along with 14 
rebounds in only 25 minutes of playing time vs. Gallaudet. Liddic scored 14 of the Mules' first 19 second-half points in the championship game and was named
tournament MVP.

Liddic is the first Mule to start a season with three consecutive 20-point games since Dennis Adams in 1993-94.

Muhlenberg is 3-0 for only the second time in the last 11 years and will look for its first 4-0 start since 1996-97 when it hosts Gettysburg in its 
CC opener tomorrow night.

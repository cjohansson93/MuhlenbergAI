Campus Community Message from President Harring
Friday, March 6, 2020

To the Muhlenberg Community, 
In an effort to keep our community as informed as possible, I write to share the latest updates as we prepare for the campus community to return from spring break.  
As of March 6, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf has announced that there are two presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in the state of Pennsylvania.  Muhlenberg College and the greater City of Allentown do not have any confirmed cases at this time. Current efforts of the College remain primarily preventative in nature to maintain the health and safety of our campus community.  We are also continually monitoring this evolving situation in order to develop short and long term contingency plans if those become necessary.
Given the fluidity of the situation, we are regularly updating the Collegeâs website to share new information and recommendations for our community.  We strongly encourage all members of our community to review the Frequently Asked Questions found HERE.  
In addition, if you are concerned about your return to campus because of recent travel to a location with confirmed COVID-19 cases, please review the following statements. 

Have had a known direct exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19;
Have been instructed to isolate or self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms;
Have been notified by someone that you might have been exposed to COVID-19 directly;
Have a fever, cough or shortness of breath;
Have visited a travel warning Level 3 country.

If you respond âyesâ to any of these conditions, please contact the College for further guidance.  If you are a student contact the Dean of Students Office by phone at 484-664-3182. If you are an employee contact Human Resources at hr@muhlenberg.edu.  
If you do not meet any of these conditions, you may return to campus, though please continue to follow all preventative recommendations (hand washing, etc.) from the CDC. 
Finally, we have received some inquiries about efforts by the College to keep our community as healthy as possible. Below are examples of some of the actions we have taken:

Developed policies and procedures for individuals who have potentially been exposed to COVID-19; 
Published policies and procedures guiding student, faculty and staff international and domestic travel; 
Published a visitor policy for anyone planning to come to campus;
Placed over 100 hand sanitizer stations across campus; 
Confirmed that the College's cleaning products are effective and responsive to this viral strain; 
Significantly increased our cleaning of public areas, bathrooms, and other spaces; 
Set up alternative housing options for students who may need to be placed in isolation for self-monitoring, etc.
Placed educational literature across campus with information about signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and effective prevention techniques such as handwashing.

This is a challenging situation and we appreciate your ongoing support as we continue to navigate this with our communityâs best interest in mind.  
We look forward to your return to campus.  
Sincerely,
Kathleen HarringInterim President

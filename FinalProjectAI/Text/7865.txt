Volleyball Swept at Swarthmore
 Wednesday, October 22, 2014 - page 3







					 




The Muhlenberg volleyball team had a rough night, falling in three sets to Centennial Conference-leading Swarthmore.

The loss took the Mules (22-4, 6-2) out of contention for the top seed in the CC playoffs, but they are still in strong
position for a playoff berth. The worst the Mules can do is tie for the fifth and final spot, and they can clinch a berth
with a win at Gettysburg on Saturday.

The first set was tied at 11 before the Garnet (20-5, 8-0) went on two long service runs to pull away, 25-15. Muhlenberg
never led in the second set, falling 25-19, but overcame a six-point deficit to tie the third at 16-16. Again Swarthmore 
closed strong, finishing off the match, 25-21.

Junior Chelsea Kaser (right) recorded 22 digs for the Mules, while junior Katherine Boll and
sophomore Allison Glass led the attack with nine kills apiece.

women’s soccer thunders past fords

goal for the Muhlenberg women’s soccer team, a goal by classmate Valerie Patriarca is not far behind.

For the second game in a row, the duo scored a pair of rapid goals as the Mules (5-1-2, 2-0) stormed past Haverford, 3-0, for their third consecutive win.

Nine days ago against Neumann, Goldstein and Patriarca scored in a span of 2:18 to give Muhlenberg a 2-0 lead. This time the lightning was a little closer, as the duo connected just 38 seconds apart – the fastest two goals by the Mules since they put away two in 15 seconds in 1998.

Goldstein opened the scoring at the 35:03 mark when she broke through the defense at the top of the box, went right and blasted the ball low into the right corner. Muhlenberg quickly regained possession and doubled its lead when sophomore 
Kasey Hacker sent in a long volley from the right flank to Patriarca, who plucked the ball out of the air with her toe and redirected it past the goalie.

The Mules weren’t done. Four minutes later sophomore Christina O’Grady drove in a loose ball after a scramble at the top of the box.

The three goals in a span of 4:39 came against a Ford squad that hadn’t allowed more than two scores to Muhlenberg since 1993. They also were a welcome development for a team that had had trouble putting games away.

“Our biggest thing [to work on] has been not letting up in the last five minutes,” said Goldstein. “We’ve gone into a lot of overtimes so it was nice to just stay strong.”

Sophomore Kate Morrissey made seven saves for her third shutout of the season, her second in a row. The Mules will enter their Homecoming match against Dickinson – the second-highest scoring team in the Centennial Conference – unscored upon in their last 270 minutes.

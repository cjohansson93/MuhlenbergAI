   Bruce D. Anderson     â    Professor of Chemistry    Shankweiler 334   (484) 664-3269

Background B.A., McDaniel College Ph.D., University of Colorado
Research Interests: Fluorescence Spectroscopy â Fluorescence and fluorescence quenching techniques, including resonance energy transfer, are used to investigate a variety of problems with biological or environmental applications. Current work is examining how soil pollutants such as PAH's and antibiotics bind to humic acid. Laser induced fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime measurements will be developed in the near future.
Laser Initiated Reactions â A Nd:YAG laser is used to irradiate a solution of graphite in alcohol and linear polyynes are produced. Research continues to investigate how to increase the yield of the polyynes and probe the mechanism of polyyne formation.  Research involving other solvents, changing the laser power, irradiation time and solution concentration is underway.

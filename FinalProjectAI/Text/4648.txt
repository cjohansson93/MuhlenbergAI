Women's lax win clinchesmatte award for Muhlenberg
 


Several members of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team may have practically been coughing up a lung, but against Moravian the Mules gave a performance that was anything but sickening.

Ten different Mules found the back of the net - four of whom scored hat tricks - in a healthy 20-5 defeat of the Greyhounds.




Sophomore Kelsey Elmer searches for an open teammate.



“The entire team has the same exact cough,” said senior Alyssa Bascelli. “We hear it throughout every practice. We’ve kind of gotten used to it.”



Baseball Loses in Ninth



A baseball game that was added to the schedule late was decided late, as Moravian scored a run in the bottom of the ninth to defeat Muhlenberg, 4-3.

The Mules (6-9) trailed 3-1 before rallying to tie the score in the seventh on a two-run single by freshman Joseph Vila, bringing home freshman Taylor Sutton, who singled, and junior Jeff Puklin, who walked.

Muhlenberg got off to a quick start, as senior Dan Fisher led off the game by doubling off the fence in left. It was the 32nd career double for Fisher, moving him to within five of the school record. Two outs later, junior Joseph DiCecilia singled up the middle to bring in Fisher and drive in a run for the fifth straight game.

In the bottom of the first, junior Jason Daniels struck out the side, fanning the first two hitters on six pitches. Daniels only pitched one inning in a tuneup for a Centennial Conference start this weekend. The six pitchers the Mules used combined to strike out 10 hitters.

The Greyhounds (6-5) scored the winning run on a leadoff single, a sacrifice and three walks.

Muhlenberg (5-1) has also gotten used to beating non-conference foes - Moravian (2-4) was its 31st consecutive victim outside the Centennial Conference - and milestones. Bascelli’s lone assist was her 100th career point, making her the second Mule in three games to accomplish the feat.

“It’s a great accomplishment and I’m excited about it, but I couldn’t have done it without my teammates,” she said. “It just reflects everything our team is working for.”

The team also worked for the deciding victory in the Matte Award contest with Moravian. The win gave Muhlenberg a commanding 10-2 lead in the all-sports competition with six contests still to play, clinching the award for the second straight year.




Davin makes the move that would lead to her second goal of the game.




The Mules jumped out to a similarly commanding lead, 5-0, in the first 13 minutes of the lacrosse game. Sophomore Angela Napoletano sandwiched two goals between a pair of goals by senior Amanda McGovern, and freshman Molly Davin followed with another.

With Muhlenberg up 5-1, senior Danielle Scarrone scored and then junior Danielle Rosen followed with a pair of goals just 44 seconds apart. The Mules went into halftime leading 13-2, with McGovern, Napoletano and Scarrone all already having tallied hat tricks at the break.

It was more of the same in the second half, and the only question remaining was if Bascelli would reach the century mark. She did with an assist 10:07 into the period, and she later added two goals.

“We played together as a team today,” commented Bascelli. “We are getting into the heart of our schedule with conference games coming up. It was great preparation.”

Rosen added another goal in the second half for the fourth Mule hat trick of the game. Davin scored twice, and Scarrone led Muhlenberg with three assists. Bascelli had a game-best six draw controls.

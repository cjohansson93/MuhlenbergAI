Official Notice to the Muhlenberg Community from President Harring and Executive Director of Health & Counseling Services
Saturday, March 21, 2020

Dear Muhlenberg Community,
We write to follow-up about a community member who was tested for COVID-19. Today we were notified by the individual, a Muhlenberg student, that they tested positively for COVID-19. At this time, because of the timing of the studentâs symptoms and the closure of on-campus, in-person classes, the student had minimal contact with individuals on campus, but did have some social contact with other students.
The Allentown Health Bureau is aware of the situation and is responding through their regular procedures to identify and notify contacts directly. In addition, the College will be in touch with the direct contacts reported to us by the student. We want to applaud the student for being so timely and forthright in their communication with the College out of care of our community. As we become aware of further information or instructions from the Health Bureau, the College will share those details as needed.
We understand that having a positive case within our community could add stress and anxiety. Students may contact the Counseling Center (484-664-3178) and faculty and staff may consult the  or contact Human Resources (484-664-3166) for additional guidance. We encourage you to use those services as needed.
We hope you will consider how important it is that we respect this individualâs privacy and avoid speculation and rumors. We hope you all continue to play a role in keeping our community healthy. Please practice preventive measures to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19:

Continue to practice social distancing;
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer often;
Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue;
Refrain from touching your face.

If you develop symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) or come in contact with a person known to have COVID-19, please make sure to stay home. If you are a student, contact Health Services (healthservices@muhlenberg.edu, 484-664-3199) and if you are a staff or faculty member, contact Human Resources (hr@muhlenberg.edu, 484-664-3166). It is important for the College to understand the health status of our students, faculty and staff, as that will have an impact on future decisions.
Sincerely,Kathleen E. Harring, Interim PresidentBrynnmarie Dorsey, Executive Director, Health & Counseling Services

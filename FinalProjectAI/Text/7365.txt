Emily Szulman won 8-2 at No. 1 for their 20th career victory together. Freshman Sara Finger and
junior Sharen Resnikoff also won 8-2 at No. 2.

At third doubles, junior Jennifer Goldberg and senior Gabriela Contino came back from a 7-3 deficit and
saved eight match points before winning 9-8 in a tiebreaker.

All six singles players won in straight sets, with freshman Jamie Rosenblum posting
a 6-0, 6-0 shutout at fifth singles. Goldberg won her second set at love at No. 3.

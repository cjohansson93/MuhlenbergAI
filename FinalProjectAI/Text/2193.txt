Tyler Holoboski '16 â Dance Major

We've received this correspondence from Tyler Holoboski '16, and we'd like to share! Tyler and his alter-ego, Petti Cake, have been making a name for themselves on the NYC Drag sceneâ¦

"I am very proud of the work that Iâve done and the level of self-acceptance Iâve found through drag. The Theatre & Dance Department has really taught me so much about performance and honing my craft! Itâs amazing how much of it I can apply to being a man in a wig performing in bars. Iâve performed with RuPaulâs Drag Race girls, Iâve performed across different states, and Iâve even booked my own weekly show. Drag is as much of a production as any dance concert Iâve ever been in, except now I have to worry about the whole package- choreography, costuming, makeup, music editing, wig styling, setting up bookings, money management, auditioning, hosting, and then performing. Iâm a one-woman show and itâs absolutely amazing the amount of work it takes to even walk out the door.

"I really encourage anybody interested in drag to reach out to me! I love helping new queens get their feet wet in the city. My show in Astoria is an open stage where anyone that comes in face (king, queen, or something in between) can perform. It can be a really tough world out here in the city, and now you canât even throw a rock without hitting another new queen. I think itâs absolutely necessary to be able to have a safe space to perform and grow with people that want to see you succeed.

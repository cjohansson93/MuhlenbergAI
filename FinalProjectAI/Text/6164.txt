Men's Lacrosse Comes Up Short in Quadruple Overtime
 Saturday, March 3, 2012 - page 3







					 





Reilly went low to beat the Scranton keeper on this game-tying goal in the third quarter.



It felt like a game that would never end. But unfortunately for the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team, when its game with Scranton finally came to a close, the Mules came up just short.

In the longest game in program history, the Mules fell to the Royals 8-7 on a goal with 1:56 left in the fourth overtime. The four overtimes are the most in any sport in school history, and the 74-minute game was nearly five minutes longer than the Mules triple-overtime win over Franklin & Marshall in 2008.

After a scoreless first quarter, Muhlenberg (2-2) scored twice in the opening five minutes of the second period on goals by senior Alex Ardolino and junior AJ Diaz. But the Royals, who made it to the NCAA Tournament last season, responded to score the next four to take a 4-2 halftime lead.

Coming out of the break, the Mule offense found some rhythm, scoring five times in the third quarter while the defense posted it second scoreless period of the game.

Junior Jack Reilly scored a pair of goals just 50 seconds apart, then classmate Michael Carpetto got a pass in the defensive zone, streaked down the right side of the field and fired a shot past the Royal keeper to put Muhlenberg back in front.

With less than two minutes remaining in the period, junior Doug Rheiner drew a penalty in front of the Scranton cage, which Diaz turned into a man-up goal off a feed from Reilly.

Rheiner closed out the quarter with his Centennial Conference-leading 11th goal of the season off a feed from Ardolino with just 19.3 seconds left on the clock to give the Mules a 7-4 lead entering the final frame.

But as they did in the second quarter, the Royals (2-0) showed a lot more urgency on offense and scored three times in the fourth, including twice in the final four minutes, to force overtime.

The two teams slowed the pace in the extra periods, taking time to run through set plays, but to no avail. Then with a little more than two minutes to play in the fourth overtime, the Royals forced a turnover in Muhlenberg’s defensive zone and turned it into the game-winner.

Carpetto, senior Jay Salasko and junior Ian Jones each picked up six ground balls to give the Mules a 42-36 edge in that category. Salasko’s total doubled his previous career high, and Jones won 15 of 22 faceoffs, tying his career high for faceoffs won.

Junior James Fasola made a career-high 17 saves in goal, his third straight game with double figure stops, and senior Jonathan Fritog picked up a career-high four ground balls and caused two turnovers.

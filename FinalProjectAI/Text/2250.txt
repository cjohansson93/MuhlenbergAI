The Daniel J. and Carol Shiner Wilson Grant for the Completion of Scholarly Projects are presented to faculty to assist with the completion of a significant work of scholarly activity. This year, the College named four faculty recipients of the award:

Benjamin Carter, Associate Professor of Sociology & Anthropology
Francesca Coppa, Professor of English
Jordanna Sprayberry, Associate Professor of Biology & Neuroscience
Erika Sutherland, Associate Professor of Spanish

The Muhlenberg College Honors Convocation is a formal academic ceremony designed to honor and celebrate leadership and scholarly excellence and achievement. This year marks the College's 172nd year of higher education and, due to the nationwide impact of COVID-19, the first time the ceremony was conducted virtually.

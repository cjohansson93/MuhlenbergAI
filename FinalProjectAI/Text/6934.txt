Softball Breaks College Record for Wins in Sweep of F&M

Muhlenberg fielded its first intercollegiate athletic team in 1900, and in the 113 years since no Mule squad had won more than 27 games or matches in a season.

Until now.




Senior Jessica Costa was 2-for-3 with two RBI in the opener.



The Muhlenberg softball team swept Franklin & Marshall, 7-3 and 8-2, in its final Centennial Conference games of the season to run its record to 28-7-1. The first win set the softball program record for wins, and the second one knocked the 1992 volleyball team (27-6) off the top of the list of winningest Mule teams ever.

“No one mentioned it until the end when Coach told us. We were pretty excited,” said senior Devon Barber.

“All those teams that got those great records must have been absolutely phenomenal,” she added. “To be mentioned among them is a complete honor.”

This softball team is phenomenal in its own right. The Mules, who will host the CC playoffs next weekend, ended up 14-2 in the CC to match the best record in program history, achieved previously in 2000. Muhlenberg’s four-game lead over second-place McDaniel and Haverford tied the biggest margin in league history.

The Mules, who have won eight in a row for the second time this season, trailed F&M (16-20, 6-10) by two runs in the first game before freshman Taylor Trifiolis hit her first career home run, a three-run shot, in the fourth. Two more runs scored that inning, and two more came across in the sixth.

That was more than enough for sophomore Kelsey Jones, who was far from perfect in her first start since throwing a perfect game but still improved to 15-2 overall and a perfect 9-0 in the CC.

No comeback was needed in the nightcap, as Muhlenberg scored in three of the first four innings to open up a 5-0 lead. Three pitchers combined to keep the Diplomats off the board in every inning but one.

The Mules pounded out 16 hits in the game and got contributions all throughout the lineup. Leadoff hitter Alyssa Schell went 4-for-5 with a pair of RBI, and ninth hitter Alexis Giovinazzo, who tripled in the first game, was 2-for-3 with a double and two RBI. In between, cleanup hitter Brittany Dzieciolowski was 2-for-3 with two RBI; Barber, hitting seventh, went 3-for-4; and Colleen O’Donnell (sixth) and Elizabeth Sullivan (eighth) had a pair of hits apiece.

“It’s nice to know that we have a very good lineup, and even the bench is very good,” said Barber, who is two runs away from tying the school career record of 114. “Everyone can come through when they need to. It’s great to have that confidence in each other.”

That confidence is growing as Muhlenberg (which closes out the regular season at Scranton on Tuesday) prepares to defend its first-place finish in the league tournament.

“It seems like recently after our games we’ve been saying what a good team win that was,” said Barber. “Anything anybody does, even if it’s fielding a routine ground ball, is big. We need those steps to get us where we ultimately want to be.”

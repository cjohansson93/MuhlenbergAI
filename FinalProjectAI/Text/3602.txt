men's basketball towers over mcdaniel


Although Kevin Hargrove is a freshman just 12 games into his college basketball career, he already has a reputation.

When Muhlenberg junior Spencer Liddic got shaken up after drawing a foul late in the second half against McDaniel, he had to come out of the game. McDaniel got to pick who would shoot the free throws and didnt hesitate to tab Hargrove, who came in just 10-for-26 from the line on the season.

I expected it. I knew right away they were going to pick me, said Hargrove with a smile.

Hargrove (who made one of the two free throws) is also

quickly developing a reputation as a dominant big man. Three days after setting a school record with 10 blocked shots, he scored a career-high 23 points on perfect 9-for-9 shooting to help Muhlenberg snap a five-game losing streak with an 80-66 win.

The Mules (6-6, 2-3), who hadnt scored more than 56 points in their last four games, tied their season high for points and shot 58.7 percent from the field. And it came against a Green Terror squad that came in leading the Centennial Conference in scoring defense, allowing only 57.3 points per game.

Hargrove attributed the offensive explosion to spacing and

smarter play. We spaced out a lot better today. We still had too many turnovers, but when we didnt we made smart plays and got the ball inside.

Getting the ball inside is a good idea with the 6-7 Liddic and 6-10 Hargrove patrolling the paint. The two combined for 50 points on 18-of-21 shooting and 22 rebounds against McDaniel (5-7, 2-3). Liddic recorded his CC-leading seventh double-double of the season with game highs of 27 points and 13 rebounds.

Liddic almost completed his double-double in the first half, going into the break with 11 points and 9 rebounds. He and Hargrove combined for 14 points in a game-opening 24-8 run in which the Mules shot 11-of-14 from the field.

I feel like I take a lot of load off of him, said Hargrove of playing with Liddic. Last year he had to do a lot of it by himself. And I have someone to learn under, especially on the offensive end.

It was a play Hargrove made on the defensive end that led to a strange ending of the first half. With 20.4 seconds left, the freshman stood his ground and drew a player-control foul in the post. The McDaniel coach protested the call vehemently and was given a double technical. Freshman Austin Curry made three of the four free throws, extending the Mules lead to 35-18.

McDaniels press caused Muhlenberg some problems in the second half, but the margin never got below eight points. After losing three straight games in which they led at the half, the Mules shot 63.2 percent from the field and 86.4 percent from the line in the second 20 minutes against McDaniel.

Our biggest thing was staying together when they got on a run, said Hargrove. Today we finally did that.

Curry finished with 12 points, including a big three-pointer and the shot-clock buzzer early in the second half.

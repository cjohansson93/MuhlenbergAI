Men’s Golf in Third After First Round


The Muhlenberg men’s golf team is in third place after the first round of the Muhlenberg Invitational.

The tournament is unique in that the two rounds are at two different courses. The 12 teams played at Center Valley Golf Club for the first 18 holes and are slated to tee off at Lehigh Country Club, the Mules’ regular home course, for Monday’s second round.

With a score of 313, Muhlenberg trailed Trinity (300) and 22nd-ranked Allegheny (309).

Junior Biff Slocum led the Mules with a 4-over-par 76. Freshman Matthew Cohen, playing as an individual, senior Geoffrey Kelleman and sophomore Zachary Oyer each came in at 77.

For the fourth time in his career. senior John DeLuca of the Muhlenberg football team was named offensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.

DeLuca rushed for a career-high 242 yards and three touchdowns in the Mules’ 49-6 win at McDaniel. All three of his scores came in the third quarter, including a career-long 72-yarder. DeLuca also returned two kickoffs for 63 yards, giving him 305 all-purpose yards on the afternoon.

It was the 14th 200-yard effort in Muhlenberg history, and the first since 2003. DeLuca, who has 16 career 100-yard games, leads the CC in rushing (156.0 yards per game) and all-purpose running (188.3 yards per game) and is second in scoring (9.0 points per game).

The win at McDaniel, combined with Franklin & Marshall’s 23-20 loss at Moravian, gave the Mules (6-0, 4-0) a two-game lead in the CC with four games to play. Five teams (Johns Hopkins, Moravian, Gettysburg, Dickinson and F&M) have two losses apiece.

Muhlenberg remains at No. 5 in the D3Football.com poll.

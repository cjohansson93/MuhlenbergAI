Track Teams Beat the Snow, Records
 Friday, February 8, 2013







					 


In advance of Winter Storm Nemo dumping a forecasted foot of snow on New York City, the Muhlenberg track and field teams traveled to Manhattan to compete in the Lafayette-Rider Games at the famed Armory. And they not only beat the snow, but they also beat some records.




Newcomb's time of 2:37.59 in the 1,000 ranks fifth on the Mules' all-time performance list. He finished second.


Senior Samantha Mayden, freshman Melanie Tramontina and junior Stephanie Carnevale all set school records in an impressive afternoon of running.

Mayden finished second in the 3,000 meters with a time of 9:57.63, shattering the previous school record by more than 16 seconds. She improved the time she ran just four weeks ago by 21 seconds. Mayden now owns indoor school records in the 1,000, mile and 3,000.




Sophomore Kirsten Kuchera hands off to senior Tara Keegan during the 4x400 relay. Senior Lexie Daniells and junior Lauren Zakheim also ran on the team,
which crossed the finish line with the fourth-best time (4:11.70) in team history.


Like Mayden,  Tramontina put some distance between herself and the old school record in a distance event. Tramontina ran the 5,000 in 18:15.92, knocking almost 20 seconds off the standard of 18:35.13 set eight years ago.

Carnevale broke her own school record while winning the 60-meter hurdles. Her time of 9.10 bettered the record of 9.31 she set last year and also is slightly faster than the school-record time she ran in the 55 hurdles at home two weeks ago, which converts to a 9.11 and entered the weekend tied for 13th in Division III. Carnevale also came within a hundredth of a second of the school record in the 60 meters.

The three record-breakers all posted ECAC-qualifying times, as did senior Erica Bash in the 800 meters. Her time of 2:18.88 is the second-fastest in program history. Junior Amber Lee Wojtkowski just missed qualifying for ECACs in the 60 hurdles.

Bash also ran on the 4x800 relay team, along with junior Nicki Cronin, sophomore Cassiah Sahl and freshman Claire Thornton that qualified for ECACs with a time of 9:48.72, the fifth-fastest in program history.

For the men, the 4x800 team of freshman Alex Weiner, junior  Jarrett Felix and sophomores Kieran Newcomb and Josh Elkan came in fourth. Junior Jeffrey Phillips placed sixth in the 500.
 
Senior Isaiah Vaughn ran a personal-best 22.67 while winning his heat of the 200. He already had the fastest time in the Centennial Conference season entering the weekend’s meets.

two mules named to lehigh valley team



Muhlenberg basketball players Lauren Boyle and Ryan Foster were named to the Lehigh Valley Small College Basketball Team of the Month for the first month of the 2007-08 season. 

The Team of the Month is comprised of one 


player from each of the seven small colleges in the Lehigh Valley (six for the men). The two players were honored today at a luncheon at Starter’s Pub in Bethlehem. 

Boyle (right), who also made the Team of the Month for the first month of last season, is the Mules’ leading scorer, averaging 16.6 points per game (fifth in the Centennial Conference). That includes a six-point effort against Swarthmore on a night when she had to leave the court midway through the first half to attend class; her scoring average in “complete” games is 18.1.

Boyle was named CC player of the week after scoring at least 20 points in three consecutive games and also earned a spot on the Scotty Wood Tournament all-tournament team. 

In addition to scoring, the junior also leads the 5-3 Mules in free-throw percentage (.880), free throws made (22) and steals (13). She also is third in assists (17) and fourth in rebounding (4.4 per game).

Foster (left) is one of several of young players who have made an impact on the Muhlenberg men’s team, which will head to Virginia for a tournament this weekend with a three-game winning streak. Foster leads the Mules in scoring at 13.3 points per game; his 93 points in seven games are 16 more than he scored in 18 games as a freshman last year.

Foster also leads the team in three-pointers (10) and is tied for first on the team with eight steals. He is third in assists (11) and fifth in rebounding (4.9 per game).

With 11 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to Haverford, Foster has recorded Muhlenberg’s lone double-double of the season. He scored in double figures in six of the first seven games, including a career-high 24 in a season-opening win against Philadelphia Biblical, and was named to the Scotty Wood Tournament all-tournament team.

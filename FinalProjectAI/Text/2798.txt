BOUNCE-BACK WIN IS NO LAUGHING MATTER FOR WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
 





Ten of Zabrecky’s 14 points came in the second half. As a team Muhlenberg shot 60.7 percent (17-for-28) from the floor in the second period.





Sophomore Katy Rossino of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team has been known to put funny pictures of her teammates on the backgrounds of the computers in the Life Sports Center.

Against Dickinson, Rossino helped make the joke on her opponents.

In a five-minute span in the second half she blocked three shots on the perimeter, contributing to a remarkable defensive effort that carried the Mules to a convincing 77-41 victory.

“We were intense and aggressive on defense, going for loose balls,” said Rossino. “We definitely thought it would be a much closer game, but I think we had the momentum coming out of last game because we were so upset.”

The Mules (15-3, 12-2) were so upset because they were upset, by fifth-place Johns Hopkins, on Saturday, a loss that snapped a 19-game Centennial Conference road winning streak and dropped them to 19th in this week’s D3hoops.com poll. 

But Muhlenberg responded in a big way with its 36-point win over playoff-bound Dickinson, holding the Red Devils (13-6, 9-6) to just 23.6 percent shooting and by far their lowest point total of the season. 

“This win was very important, especially with us having two losses already,” noted Rossino. “We went undefeated last year, so no one wanted to lose again this year.”

The win was also important because it clinched the Mules’ fifth straight playoff berth. Now all that’s left for Muhlenberg to settle is whether or not it will 
host the CC tournament for the second straight year. Victories by Gettysburg and McDaniel kept the Mules in a three-way tie for first; Muhlenberg’s only remaining contest against a likely playoff team comes in the home finale, against Gettysburg, in just under two weeks.

In this contest a big first-half run was all the Mules needed. Leading 7-6 after a turnover-filled first eight minutes, Muhlenberg rattled off a 17-2 run that began with three-pointers by freshman Kate Clawson, sophomore Alexandra Chili and Clawson again.




In addition to her three blocks, Rossino hit a crowd-pleasing three just before the shot clock expired to give the Mules a 33-point lead late.




Senior Kaitlyn O’Malley hit junior Kelly McKeon for a wide-open jumper late in the run, and junior Alexandra Berlin capped it with a layup after a baseline drive.

“It was close for a while, but then we started playing really good ‘D’ and got a lot of stops,” said Rossino. “We hit a few threes and then got some quick baskets. We were moving the ball really well.”

Dickinson got as close as eight early in the second half before another huge Mule run, this time 22-3. Chili found senior Alexis Bates for a triple to start it, and then Chili took over, hitting a three and driving for a layup that rolled around and around and around the rim before finally falling through the hoop.

“She always ends up making those, so I wasn’t too concerned,” joked Rossino.

Chili drained a step-back three to make it 51-28 and then closed the run with another trey, giving Muhlenberg an insurmountable 56-29 lead. She finished with 23 points in just 24 minutes of action.

Freshman Alita Zabrecky added a career-high 14 points and nine rebounds, and McKeon had eight points, six assists and four steals.

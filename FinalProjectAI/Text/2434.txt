Reality MC Prepares Graduating Seniors for Life After Muhlenberg


The three-day workshop is designed for and by Muhlenberg seniors entering their final semester at Muhlenberg.


	 Friday, January 15, 2016  03:29 PM


This year the program runs from January 15-17 and offers transition and professional development opportunities to support each student as they prepare for careers, graduate study and service work.
Sponsored and supported by the office of Student Engagement and the The Career Center, the weekend programming is shaped by a committee of Muhlenberg seniors. Their goal is to design an agenda that meets the needs and answers the questions of their peers. 
Students will join a series of targeted presentations and workshops, including "Building Your Personal Brand," "Cooking Essentials," "Renting in New York," "Non-Profit, Volunteering, and Staying Connected," "Dealing with Difficult People," and "The Real World: Life Post-Berg," a keynote presentation by Dennis Williams '97.
The focus on building connections is a key part of the weekend; students engage in a formal networking reception off campus and are challenged to treat the experience like a interview. They will meet and get to know staff, faculty, alumni and community members and learn to present themselves in a professional, compelling manner.
While the experience reinforces programming available throughout the year, the concentrated experience, timed just prior to the start of classes, provides students with a distilled series of life lessons and collegial advice. Participants learn from and meet the alumni who came before them and have already faced similar challenges and obstacles on the path to success.

tennis teams compete in tournaments




The Muhlenberg tennis teams took advantage of the beautiful fall weather and competed in tournaments over the weekend.

The men hosted the Mule Fall Classic, a flighted tournament with Moravian, Wilkes and York. The Mules who competed had to play up in the ladder, as the 
team is missing its top three players (two studying abroad and the other taking the fall off).

Freshman Jason Teitelbaum (left) was the lone Muhlenberg player to win his first-round match, coming back after dropping the
first set to take a tight second set and a supertiebreaker at second singles. He was defeated in the championship final, however.

Teitelbaum also teamed up with senior Wayne Mitchel to capture the consolation final at first doubles. Junior Jason Richman
won two consolation finals, solo at fifth singles and with junior Robert Buesser at third doubles.

The women traveled to The College of New Jersey to compete in the Lions' Kickoff Tournament. The tournament was broken into four flights of 
singles matches, followed by three rounds of doubles play. 

The Mules had a rough day against the Lions, who advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament in the spring. Muhlenberg picked up only three
wins in 23 matches, by senior Sara Sutker in A singles, Sutker and classmate Caitie Druker in the third doubles round and 
sophomore Amanda von Taube in D singles.

Men's Golf Opens at Allegheny: The Muhlenberg men's golf team is in eighth place out of 16 teams after the first round of the Guy W. Kuhn
Invitational, hosted by Allegheny. Senior Zachary Oyer led the Mules with a 76.

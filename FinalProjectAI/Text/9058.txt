Center for Ethics Spring 2008 Women in Global Perspective
In the fall programming series, Globalization From Above and Below, we explored the various meanings of globalization and its ethical implications.  This semester, we'll focus our lens and look more narrowly at how women, in the U.S. and around the world (particularly Asia), affect and are being affected by the processes of globalization.  What contributions, for example, do women make to the global economy, politics, and society?  What about the arts, education, and religion?  Do women bring unique perspectives to the processes of globalization?  To what extent have they altered the way various global systems and processes work?  And, finally, in what ways has globalization affected women's traditional roles as wives and mothers?

Welcome Home
Through our holistic approach to residential living, students open doors to self-understanding, deep learning and lasting friendships. Living on campus provides a shared responsibility in maintaining a safe and inclusive community, conducive to academic achievement, wellness and respect. The Office of Housing and Residence Life ensures these goals are met with the help of student leaders to create a community like no other.
We know that most college students spend between 80 and 100 hours per week in their residence halls, more than in all other spaces on campus. Our resident advisors and hall directors make the most of this time through community development, cultural understanding, educational programming, life skill-building opportunities and mentorships. 
Below you'll find more about our housing options, leadership opportunities and tips on how to make the most of your experience living on campus as well as important forms and applications. Feel free to stop by the Office of Housing and Residence Life on the ground floor of Prosser Hall. Call us at 484-664-3180 or email housing@muhlenberg.edu for more information.

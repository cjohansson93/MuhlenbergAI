Freshman Nicolette Miller ran the second leg on the second-place 4x800 team and finished eighth in the open 800.



74 points after projecting to score 61 based on the performance lists. The men were fourth, just one point out of third place and two points out of second. Both squads improved their standing from last year by two places.

Performer for track events. He is only the second Mule male to be so honored in the 16-year history of the CC. After winning gold medals in the mile and distance-medley relay on Saturday, Chorney added a silver in the 3,000 meters and a fourth-place finish in the 800 on the second day.

Muhlenberg’s lone gold on the second day came courtesy of the men’s 4x800 relay team, which won for the fourth straight year. The team – junior Patrick Thornton, sophomores Bobby Torphy and Chris Dolan and senior Stuart Udis - was the same one that won last year. Udis has been a part of all four winning 4x800 teams; Thornton the last three.

Udis and Torphy also finished second and third, respectively, in the open 800.

The women’s team broke two school records on the second day of the meet. Junior Jennifer Lynch obliterated the oldest record in the women’s indoor book, running the 3,000 meters in 10:13.99. The previous mark of 10:23.54 had stood since 1993. Lynch also ran the lead leg of the 4x800 relay team that brought home a silver medal.

Junior Alex Faust broke the school record in the 400 meters, although she didn’t win the event for the first time. Faust’s clocking of 59.29 was good for third place in a tight finish that saw the top three runners separated by 13 hundredths of a second. She placed in the top five in five events at the meet and now owns four indoor school records.

Freshman Kimberlee Yalango earned two silver medals on relay teams, and freshman Jenna Schaffer won a silver and a bronze, narrowly missing the school record of 7.57 in the 55 meters (she ran a 7.62).
Junior Debra Crockett missed her own school record in the shot put by an inch and a quarter.

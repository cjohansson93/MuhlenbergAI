Interests: I am a Professor in the Biology Department and Director of Sustainability Studies at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA.  I teach laboratory and field oriented classes in Plant Ecology, Botany, and Sustainability Studies including a course regularly taught in Costa Rica. In my lab we focus on two distinct, but related areas: plant ecology and conservation biology and sustainable development. In plant ecology, we have worked on pollination and fruit set; genetics of inbreeding; mechanisms of non-random mating in plants; sex ratio variation; plant-animal interactions, and plant conservation biology. With current research funding from The National Science Foundation and Merck/AAAS, we are now primarily focused on the ecological, genetic, and chemical factors that influence insect herbivory in Lindera. This includes an analysis of "top-down" and "bottom-up" ecological factors, and the use of our field gas chromatograph (Z-nose), microsattelite analysis, and HPLC.  In the area of conservation biology and sustainable development, we havecollaborated with the International Programs Department at the Rodale Institute on measuring the success of sustainable forestry practice in northern Guatemala, and on developing ways to effectively link social, economic, and ecological indicators in the evaluation of international conservation and development projects. I have been working in the Costa Rican community of Las Juntas de Abangares for 15 years on ecoeducational tourism development, public health and environmental studies on the effects of local gold mining, and the development of alternative fuels. I currently have a book in progress on the environmental, cultural and public health aspects of artisinal goldmining with photographer Joseph Elliot. We also work with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in our studies of ecology and conservation. We also conduct research at the interface between environment and human/public health, and have assessed interdisciplinary education, short-term study abroad, and community based environmental education. I am currently writing a book for Oxford Univeristy Press entitled Sustainable Solutions: Problem Solving for Current and Future Generations
 I Chair Muhlenberg's Sustainability and Campus Tree Committees, and Co-Direct the Office of Campus Sustainability.  I am a Fair Trade Coffee advocate and addict, and I frequently play late-night ice hockey. 
 Students who have interest in doing research in any of these areas, and are willing to make the commitment that I expect from all of my research students are encouraged to contact me.

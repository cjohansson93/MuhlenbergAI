A wide selection of four-, six- and 10-week courses are available. Summer I begins May 25. Summer II begins July 12. Registrations are now being accepted, and will be accepted until the first day of classes for each session. Summer study provides the opportunity for many students to achieve their educational goals. The program assists high school students to get a head start on their college education, for traditional university students to gain college credits, for adult students to move closer to their degrees, and for community members to pursue their interests. Courses will be available in the following disciplines: accounting, art history, anthropology, biology, business administration, chemistry, media & communication, economics, English, environmental sciences, finance, geography, history, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religion, sociology, Spanish, studio arts, and theatre. For more information on any of the classes or to request a catalog, call 484-664-3300, email wescoe@muhlenberg.edu, or visit Muhlenberg Summer Study online at http://www.muhlenberg.edu/wescoe/current/summer.shtml

Men's Basketball Suffers First Loss
 Tuesday, November 22, 2011 - page 2







					 





Liddic's 15 rebounds gave him 772 for his career, good for 13th on the CC all-time list.



 The Muhlenberg men’s basketball team’s bid for its first 4-0 start in 15 years came to an end at the hands of a strong second-half rally by Gettysburg.

The Mules led by five at the break and went up by as many as seven in the second half, but the Bullets battled back for a 72-68 win in the Centennial Conference opener for both teams.

Muhlenberg was ahead for most of the first half, but out of the break, the Bullets rallied back and took a one-point lead less than three minutes into the 
second half. That’s when the Mules responded with a quick run to jump back in front.

Freshman Malique Killing knocked down a pullup jumper near the elbow to start the rally. Then classmate AJ Dean grabbed a steal under the Bullet basket, and senior Spencer Liddic converted a layup to put the Mules up 46-43.

Killing added a fadeaway jumper from the left corner, and then after Liddic grabbed a steal, Killing found Dean for a layup to complete the 8-0 run and force a Bullet timeout with the Mules up, 50-43.

But from there, Gettysburg responded with a run of its own, slowed the game down and outscored Muhlenberg 27-16 the rest of the way to grab the win.

The Mules pulled to within three points three times in the final 2:15 and appeared to have forced a defensive stop with 23.2 to play. But Muhlenberg was whistled for a foul under the basket, and the Bullets sank one free throw to make it a two-possession game.

Liddic finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds, both game highs, for his fourth straight double-double. Killing and Dean joined him in double figures with 13 and 12, respectively. Sophomore Austin Curry finished with nine points, all from the line, including six in the final three minutes to help keep the Mules in the game.

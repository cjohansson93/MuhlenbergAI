Study Spaces





A-level
A-Level is the first floor of Trexler Library. It has a largely open floor plan with large tables scattered throughout to encourage collaborative work, while also offering individual study carrels. A-Level is designated a social floor where conversations can be held at a normal speaking volume.   
B-level
B-Level is the second floor of Trexler Library. There are individual study carrels throughout the floor with group tables along the east wall of the building. B-Level has a quieter dynamic: group work can still be done, but conversations should be held at a lower volume.  B-Level also has two reservable spaces: the Collaboration Room and the One Button Studio. The Collaboration Room is a study space with resources designed to make group work more efficient. The One Button Studio is a unique space created to provide user-friendly video making equipment for all skill levels. Please see the One Button Studio guide or the Collaboration Room page for more information on either resource.
C-level
C-Level is the bottom floor of Trexler Library and is designated a quiet study space. Patrons can find individual study carrels as well as several study tables on this floor. C-Level has four study rooms that are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Though anyone may use these rooms, priority is given to groups rather than individuals. These study rooms are equipped with blackboards and whiteboards, but they are not soundproof.
Terraces
Trexler Library has three terraces that are adjacent to the main staircase. These open spaces are filled with natural light. The terraces contain study tables, lounge chairs and couches, and bean bags chairs. The second terrace, also known as B-Level terrace, is accessible.

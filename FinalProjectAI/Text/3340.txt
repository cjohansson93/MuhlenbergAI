Muhlenberg battled Moravian, the second-ranked team in the East Region, but came out on the short end in both games of the doubleheader, 5-1 and 3-2.

Muhlenberg did climb out of a 2-0 hole in the nightcap, plating runs on two-out hits by senior Samantha Crist and sophomore Jess Kasza in the fourth and fifth. Moravian won on a walkoff single with one out in the seventh.

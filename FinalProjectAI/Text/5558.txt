Despite winning four of six singles matches, Muhlenberg closed out its season with a 5-4 loss at Elizabethtown.

Senior Jamie Goldman, playing in the final match of his career, claimed a 6-1, 6-2 win at No. 6 singles. Also posting notable wins were freshmen Dan Zakheim, who recorded his first career victory at No. 1, and Wayne Mitchel, who notched his team-leading eighth singles success.

Muhlenberg was held to five hits in an 8-3 non-conference loss at Gwynedd-Mercy.

The Mules (18-16) cut an early 6-0 deficit in half and got the tying run to the plate in the top of the seventh, but the Griffins added two insurance runs in the bottom of the inning.

By a margin of two strokes, the men’s golf team gave Muhlenberg a chance to tie for the 2007-08 Matte Award.

The Mules finished third at the Lehigh Valley Cup, the annual competition between four local schools. This year’s meet was especially close, with the four squads separated by four strokes.

Muhlenberg finished two strokes ahead of Moravian, which entered the day with a 9-7 lead in the Matte standings. Muhlenberg is now within one of the Greyhounds and can forge in a tie by winning the final Matte contest of the year, Wednesday night’s men’s lacrosse game.

Freshman Jordan Carpenter (left) led the Mules with a 78, three strokes off the lead, in the final tuneup before this weekend’s Centennial Conference Championships.

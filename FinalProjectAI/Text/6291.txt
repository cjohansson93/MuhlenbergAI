Spring Break was a little unsettling for Kelsey Elmer.

The senior co-captain was one of the members of the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team to get hit with a stomach bug during last week’s trip to Hilton Head. She missed the practice before the Mules’ game against Eastern and played sparingly in the game.

But after a weekend back home to relax and recuperate, Elmer 




Sophomore Ally Shaffer scored her fourth goal of the season to break the 4-4 tie. She also caused two turnovers.



returned at full strength and helped Muhlenberg win its home opener, 20-13 against Lebanon Valley.

“I’m feeling good now,” said a smiling and healthy Elmer after the game. “I’m feeling good about the win.”

She had reason to. The Mules shook off an early challenge from the Dutchmen (2-2) and got contributions 



Junior Alex Bellini had two goals and an assist in the Mules' 5-0 second-half run.




from many players in improving to 3-0 for the season. 

Junior Molly Davin and sophomore Michelle Certosimo led the offense with a career-high seven points apiece, while freshman Stephanie Umbach scored five points and recorded nine draw controls, one short of the school record.

In all, nine different players scored goals, including four who came off the bench. Muhlenberg used its depth throughout the game to stay fresh on the unseasonably warm day, whereas Lebanon Valley substituted only one field player until the final moments.

“We worked on our defense and tried some different things on offense,” said Elmer. “It was good to have a game like this to see what works and who works well together for when we start conference play.”

The Dutchmen, who made the Middle Atlantic Conference playoffs last season in only their second year as a varsity sport, overcame an early three-goal deficit to tie the score at 4-4 with 17:15 left in the first half. But the Mules responded by scoring three goals in a span of 60 seconds, the last coming when Umbach intercepted a clearing pass at midfield, ran in and fed Certosimo for a putaway at the opposite post.

Senior Angela Napoletano scored a little more than a minute later to make it 8-4, but the Dutchmen stayed within striking distance and were within 12-9 after scoring the first two goals of the second half. It was 15-11 before Muhlenberg put the game away with a 5-0 run late in the game.

“It was definitely good for us to have a team challenge us like that,” said Elmer, who scored her first goal of the season early in the game. “We can’t take anyone for granted. We have to come out at the top of our game every time.”

Certosimo scored her five goals on only seven shots, and Davin netted four on five shots. Sophomore Claudia Rogers doubled her career total by scoring a pair of goals, one assisted by junior Jill Freda, who notched her first career point. 

It was a great way to lead in to the Mules’ Centennial Conference opener against eighth-ranked Franklin & Marshall on Saturday.

“It’s a tough conference, but I think we have what it takes to make a run. We have great team cohesion,” said Elmer. “ “I’m really excited and optimistic.”

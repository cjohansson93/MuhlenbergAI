The departments of international studies, public health, political science and economics will sponsor the conference.
The event will run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Seegers Union Event Space and will include three hour-long themed sessions, a luncheon for the speakers and invited students and faculty and a roundtable session to cap off the event. The speakers at the conference will be from United Nations-affiliated agencies, and topics will include public health, conflict and sustainability in relation to global climate change.
HEA is an alliance brought to life by the Humpty Dumpty Institute. HEA serves to build bridges between the UN and academic institutions, aiding in the process of creating the next generation of global leaders and instilling global awareness on campuses. HEA has partnered with international communications firms based in Europe to extend the alliance worldwide.

Humpty Dumptyâs partners include the U.S. government, the United Nations, sovereign nations around the world, celebrities and activists, other leaders and non-governmental organizations.

Top Workplaces 2013 


Muhlenberg College has been named one of the Morning Call's Top 30 Places to Work in the Lehigh Valley.


	 Monday, March 25, 2013  08:39 AM


In the first annual survey, the College was ranked second among businesses with more than 500 employees.  In addition, the College was ranked first for its communication efforts with employees.
“I think we all know that what makes Muhlenberg great - and a great place to work - is its people,” said the College’s President Randy Helm.  “Everybody here realizes that the work we do at Muhlenberg is important and each of us plays a key role in fulfilling the College's mission.  I've known since I first set foot on campus ten years ago that this is a great place to work, but it is nice to know that so many of us feel that way and that our shared efforts have been publicly recognized.”
Workplace Dynamics, of Exton, Pa., conducted the survey.  More than 7,000 employees from 506 companies in the Lehigh Valley completed the survey.
The Morning Call honored the Top 30 workplaces with a special section in the Sunday, March 3 edition of the newspaper, in which Muhlenberg is featured.  Beginning next week, the College will have a special postal meter stamp recognizing the achievement.  Additionally, ‘Berg  received a plaque for its Top 30 honor and a plaque recognizing its top ranking for communication.
Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg College is a highly selective, private liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.  The Muhlenberg experience is characterized by a deep sense of community and connection, intense student-faculty relationships and collaboration; small classes; passionate teaching and active learning; and powerful outcomes in terms of graduate school and entry-level career placement.

Muhlenberg College has its own campus wide television station, distributed by cable to all of the residence halls, wired offices, and campus facilities.
MBC (Channel 21) is a student run organization dedicated to showcasing student works and to bringing informative and entertaining programming to the Muhlenberg campus.
With a rich history, and programming a wide variety of student-produced media, the club also creates its own in-house productions including the weekly MBC News.
MBC is open to anyone!  You too can get involved. Let your ideas be heard and showcase your talents. We want to help you bring your idea to life. No prior experience is necessary as we will teach you all you need to know to get started.
Meetings are held Tuesdays at 5pm in Walson 115.

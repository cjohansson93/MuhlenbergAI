Basketball Teams Advance to Scotty Wood Championships
 Friday, November 21, 2014 - page 3







					 



Memorial Hall turned into the Department of Defense on the first day of the 33rd Scotty Wood Tournament.


The two Muhlenberg basketball teams allowed a combined 85 points as both advanced to the championship games for
the 20th time in the last 22 years.

The women defeated Albertus Magnus, 74-42, and will face eighth-ranked Scranton, a 60-43 winner against Wilkes,
in the final for the third time in eight years. The men toppled Cairn, 88-43, to earn a championship matchup with Widener,
a 75-49 winner against FDU-Florham, in a sequel to the schools’ NCAA Tournament meeting in football in the
afternoon.

Senior Leanna Tallamy led the women’s team with 21 points in only 20 minutes, while
senior Nicole Pepe (left) added 11. 

Senior Janelle Fleet had an outstanding all-around game, with seven points, eight rebounds and
five assists, and junior Christina Santone blocked four shots.

Albertus Magnus missed its first 18 shots from the field and shot only 20.6 percent for the game. The
Mules (2-1) opened a double-digit lead less than eight minutes in and never let it slip below seven.


Muhlenberg led by 41 points (74-33) with two minutes left and threatened the Scotty Wood record for fewest points
allowed (36) before the Falcons (1-2) made three three-pointers.

The men’s game started a little differently, as Cairn began hot from the field and opened up an 18-12 lead
nine minutes in. That’s when the Mules (3-0) turned up the defense, holding the Highlanders to one field
goal the rest of the half.

Muhlenberg closed the half on a 29-5 run, then began the second half with a 22-4 surge to put the game out of reach.

Senior Malique Killing led the Mules with 20 points, and junior Alec Stavetski
added 19. Junior Nick Melosky (right) netted a career-high 11, making all three of his three-point attempts.

Sophomore Jon Schreer contributed six points, eight assists (without a turnover) and five steals.

The Mules shot 60 percent from the field, going 7-of-10 from three-point range, in the second half and held
Cairn (0-2) to 25.9-percent shooting.

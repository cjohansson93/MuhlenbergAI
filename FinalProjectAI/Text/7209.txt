Wrestling Season Ends at Regional


The Muhlenberg wrestling team wrapped up its 2013-14 season by sending two competitors to the NCAA East Regional, hosted by King’s.

Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit picked up the lone win for the Mules, scoring a technical fall in the 149-pound consolation bracket. He finished the season with 10 wins, four more than he had last year.

Freshman Jaryd Flank dropped a pair of two-point decisions, one in the consolation bracket to the eventual third-place finisher. Flank concluded his impressive freshman season with a record of 15-12.

Junior Kurt Johnson was 2-for-4 with a double and an RBI in the second game.



The Muhlenberg baseball team ran into a strong Manhattanville squad on its first day in Myrtle Beach and was swept in a doubleheader, 3-0 and 9-7.

The Valiants, coming off a doubleheader sweep of 2013 College World Series participant Manchester, allowed only four hits in the opener, and it wasn’t until the seventh inning that the Mules (2-2) put a runner in scoring position. Junior David Anderson gave up only one hit and no runs through the first three innings but took the loss after surrendering two runs in the fourth and one in the fifth.

Manhattanville charged out to a 9-2 lead in the nightcap before Muhlenberg went to its bench to mount a comeback in the sixth. Junior Zach Hoffman delivered a pinch-hit RBI single, and with two outs, senior Max Litvak belted a three-run double. 

Senior Tyler Latrenta, who scored the first run of the game after stealing third in the opening inning, singled in the fifth run of the inning to make it 9-7.

The score stayed that way, although the Mules got the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the seventh.

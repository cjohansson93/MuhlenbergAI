men’s golf wins susquehanna invite



The Muhlenberg men’s golf team picked up its third tournament title of the year, winning the Susquehanna Invitational. 

The Mules scored a 308 to defeat the host school by four strokes. Centennial Conference foes McDaniel, Gettysburg and Dickinson were also in the 19-team field.

Freshman Zachary Oyer (right) shot a 74 to tie for second place. Classmate Jordan Carpenter and junior Geoffrey Kelleman were two strokes
back, giving Muhlenberg three of the 10 golfers who shot 76 or better.

The Mules had the same team score (308) at the Susquehanna Fall Invitational, but finished 10 strokes behind the host school.

Muhlenberg won its own tournament and the Messiah Falcon Classic in the fall. This is the first year since 2000-01 that the Mules have earned three first-place trophies.

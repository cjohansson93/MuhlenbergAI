Pamela has taught Spanish at Muhlenberg since 1992. In 2004 she became a full-time lecturer. She generally teaches the Elementary and Intermediate courses.
Pamela also team-teaches a course in Environmental Conservation with Rich Niesenbaum (Biology Department Chair). The course is taught in the Spring and culminates in a two week trip to the Costa Rican rainforest. In addition, she conducts Mesa EspaÃ±ola, a round-table discussion that gives students the opportunity to speak Spanish informally.

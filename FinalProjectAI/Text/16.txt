I built my first instrument a long time ago. After I graduated from Muhlenberg, I was living in a farmhouse with a bunch of other people in a semi-commune. The Foxfire books [instructional books about Appalachian culture] had a chapter on banjos. I built a banjo out of wood I found in the barn. I skinned a groundhog and took the hair off just like the book said and stretched it over a coffee can. It cost me about 75 cents to build this banjo. I built more banjos over the yearsâthey traditionally have a lot of âbling,â and that is how I learned to do pearl inlay.
Iâve always loved wood, and I amassed a stash from dumpster-diving at Martin Guitar back in the â70s, off-cuts from manufacturing guitars. I finally decided to do something with it, so I built a little soprano ukulele. My daughter, who was a senior in high school, had a friend over who saw it and said, âI always wanted to play the ukulele,â so I said, âTake this oneâI donât play.â She took it off to college, came back over Christmas break and visited my daughter. She told me, âThis instrument really got me through some tough times. I was new. I was feeling lonely. Iâd go into my room and play a little bit and then other people would come in.â And she came back playing these blues chords. I said, âThatâs really cool. Iâll have to build another one.â So I did, and I sold it at the local library fundraising auction. Then I built another, and another.  Iâve built 92 instruments so far.

I love music, but Iâm not a musicianâIâm an engineer. In building instruments, there are two questions, âHow do you engineer this thing to make it sound better?â and, âWhat do I do, engineering-wise, to make building these easier, faster, more accurate, more repeatable?â Now, I work in sets of three or four, and it takes me a few months each time. I build a fair amount of custom instruments, plus some for inventory and some to give as gifts. Of the four instruments on the bench right now, one is a commission, one is an experiment and two are wedding presents for my niece. Her future husband is a guitar player, so Iâm building a small parlor guitar and a tenor ukulele out of exactly the same wood. Theyâll have some inlay, and it will be a matching set.
I mostly use local woods. In the eastern United States, the Appalachian chain has more species of hardwood than any other place in the world. Now that I spend time in Florida, thereâs a whole other set of woods here. One of my favorite Florida woods is casuarina, and itâs an invasive species. Iâm making instruments out of stuff that was taken down because itâs invasive. Redwood is one of my favorite top woods, and the redwood I have used to be part of water tanks on top of New York City apartment buildings. I made a wedding present for a neighborâs daughter out of an ash tree heâd taken down. Musical instruments, to me, are a way of showing the beauty of this wood. I show off what Mother Nature created.
Iâve never liked a full-sized guitar. If you put it in your lap, you have to reach way around to play it. A ukulele, itâs like a baby: Itâs this beautiful thing that fits in your lap. You can hold it closely. It feels delicate, but itâs actually tougher than it looks. The other thing is, if you take a ukulele and just hand it to somebody, they always smile. Itâs universal. How cool is that?

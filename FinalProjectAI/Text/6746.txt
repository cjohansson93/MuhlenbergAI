Women's Basketball Falls Again in Third Straight Road Game
 Thursday, January 17, 2013







					 





Junior Erin Laney came off the bench to score four points and pull down three rebounds.




Little went right as the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team fell at Haverford, 55-41, for its third straight loss.




The Fords scored the first six points of the game, and the Mules never got closer than five points behind the rest of the game. Muhlenberg made only six field goals in the first half and went into the break trailing 26-14.



The Mules (9-6, 6-4) upped the pressure at the start of the second half and made a little run. It took them less than five minutes to match their point total of the first half, getting to within 34-28 with 15:41 left in the game. But Haverford (10-4, 7-3) hit a three-pointer on the next possession to stop Muhlenberg’s momentum.



Senior Alita Zabrecky led the Mules with 12 points. She also had three steals and two assists, bringing her career assist total to an even 200 and making her only the fourth player in team history with 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 200 assists and 150 steals.



Senior Kate Clawson added 10 points, and junior Leanna Tallamy pulled down a team-high seven rebounds.



The three-game losing streak is the first for Muhlenberg in six years.

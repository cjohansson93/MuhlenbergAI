Muhlenberg Anthropology Club
The Anthropology Club, originally founded in 2002, works to foster a sense of community and sociality among the students and faculty in the anthropology program. The club provides students interested in anthropology with opportunities to learn about professional career development, increase awareness of diverse cultural and social issues, and to generate opportunities to make positive social change.
The club plans a number of trips and activities throughout the year. Recently, these have included:

The MÃ¼tter Museum (Philadelphia)
The University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology & Archaeology
Radical Walking Tours of New York
Darwin Day activities
Student/Faculty Bowling

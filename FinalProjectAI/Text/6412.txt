Kline Slam Highlights Softball Sweep of Haverford
 Tuesday, April 3, 2012

Of the 23 runs the Muhlenberg softball team scored in its home doubleheader sweep of Haverford, six came in on errors, four on bases-loaded walks, two on fielder’s choice grounders and one on a sacrifice fly. There were a surprising lack of big hits for such a high score, but it was no surprise who had the biggest hit.

Sophomore Kelly Kline the reigning Centennial Conference player of the week, hit her first career grand slam to cap a 10-run third inning that keyed a 17-13 win in Game 2. Behind the pitching of freshman Kelsey Jones, the Mules (11-11, 6-2) won the first game, 6-0.

Kline, who entered the week third in Division III in batting average and 



Senior Brittany Blohm went 4-for-7 with a pair of doubles in the doubleheader. She has doubled in four straight games, moving into a tie for fifth place on the Mules' all-time list with 27 career two-baggers.




fourth in slugging percentage, went 3-for-8 in the doubleheader, “lowering” her average to .521 and extending her school-record hitting streak to 21 games. The grand slam was her sixth home run of the season, moving her to within one of the school record.

“It’s incredible,” said sophomore Chelsea Benjamin, who hits behind Kline in the order. “It’s funny, she hits a home run and then I come up, and it’s like – OK, my turn.”

Although Benjamin hasn’t hit a home run yet, she has done a great job with her turns at bat, hitting .373. She led off the second inning of the first game with a double and eventually scored the first run.

Muhlenberg broke the game open with five runs in the fifth, highlighted by a two-run single off the bat of freshman Alyssa Schell. 

That was more than enough for freshman Jones, who struck out seven in six shutout innings. She retired 13 straight batters from the first through the fifth and worked out of a second-and-third, no-out jam in the sixth.

Jones also picked up the win in the second game as a relief pitcher, hurling the final 2 2/3 innings of a wild game in which the teams combined for 30 runs and 31 hits. The Mules had only 11 of the 31 hits, but drew 13 walks and were helped out by five Ford errors.

There will be more on the Game 2 offensive slugfest tomorrow in The MuhlBox.

Muhlenberg trailed 4-0 before it came to the plate but took an 11-4 lead with its 10-run frame. Haverford (9-10-1, 1-7) came back to cut the deficit to one, at 11-10, before Jones struck out two batters with the bases loaded to end the fifth. 

The Mules gave themselves a comfortable lead again with six runs in the bottom of the fifth. Schell had a two-run triple in the inning, and sophomore Erica Wenzel hit a RBI double. 

The 17 runs were the most scored by the Mules in a CC game since a 22-0 shutout of Swarthmore in 1999. After scoring 52 runs in its first 13 games, Muhlenberg has plated 83 in its last nine, reaching double figures four times.

“We knew we had the best offense in the conference,” said Benjamin. “It just took us a little longer to find it. I feel like we’re really coming along.”

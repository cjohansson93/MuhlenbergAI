Men's Golf Shoots Record-Low Round at Penn State Harrisburg
 Monday, April 16, 2012







					 




The Muhlenberg men’s golf team spent plenty of time on the course the last four days, playing four rounds in a pair of tournaments.

The Mules finished second, three strokes off the lead, at the Penn State Harrisburg Spring Classic on Friday and Saturday. They came in 15th at the Lafayette Invitational, contested Sunday and Monday.

At Penn State Harrisburg, Muhlenberg set a school record by shooting a 294 in the second round. The only other sub-300 round in program history was a 299 at the Susquehanna Tee-Off Tournament in March 2000.

The 294 was 12 strokes better than any other team on the second day, but not enough to overcome Albright’s 15-stroke advantage after the first round.

Sophomore Christopher Lucarelli earned second-place honors, shooting a 74-74—148. He is only the second Mule golfer in the last 20 years to shoot below a 75 in both rounds of a two-day tournament. 

Senior Zack Meyers just missed pulling off that accomplishment when Muhlenberg played at Penn State Harrisburg in the fall, shooting 74-75—149. This time, he tied for eighth at 76-76—152.

Also tying for eighth place with junior Brandon Davis, who cut 10 strokes off his first-round score of 81. The 71 tied his career low, set last fall at Penn State Harrisburg.

Senior Jon Heppen also made a big improvement in the second round, lowering his score from 82 to 73, five strokes better than his previous career best.

 The scores went up along with the temperatures at Lafayette, where Muhlenberg was the only one of the 15 schools not from Division I. The Mules led Niagara by seven strokes after the first round but finished five strokes behind.

Davis carded a 160 to lead Muhlenberg, while Lucarelli (right) rebounded from an 87 in the first round to shoot a 78 in the second for his third round in the 70s in four days.

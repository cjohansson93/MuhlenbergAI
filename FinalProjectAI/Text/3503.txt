Men's lacrosse falls to Pacers



The Muhlenberg men's lacrosse team opened its 2011 season by losing a tight 7-5 game at Marywood. Neither team led by more than a goal until the final horn.

Of the game's 12 goals, seven came in the fourth quarter. The Mules entered the final period leading 3-2 but trailed 5-4 before senior Brent Siebold netted his second goal of the game on a rebound with 6:40 left. 

The Pacers scored the go-ahead goal with 2:46 on the clock. Muhlenberg attempted two shots in the final minute but could not find the back of the net, and Marywood put in a goal as the game ended.

Muhlenberg held a 39-26 advantage in shots. Sophomore Jack Reilly scored two goals, and sophomore Doug Rheiner had a goal and an assist.

Senior Tom Brant (right) caused 4 turnovers and picked up 5 ground balls.

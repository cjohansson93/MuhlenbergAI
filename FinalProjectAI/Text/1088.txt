Lehigh County Move to Yellow Phase
Wednesday, June 10, 2020

Dear faculty and staff,
Now that Lehigh County has moved into the Yellow Phase of Governor Wolfâs plan to reopen Pennsylvania, weâve had questions about whether faculty and staff are able to return to campus. While we are in the Yellow Phase, employees who are able to work from home should continue to do so. The process for visits to campus is unchanged at this time and continues to require approval by members of senior staff to allow for the necessary cleaning of facilities. As discussed during our recent town hall meetings, we anticipate a gradual return to campus for employees once the County enters the Green Phase. This is consistent with guidance weâve received from the state. Please know that we do not expect everyone to return to campus at once. Rather, senior staff will review and coordinate a phased approach, with a portion of faculty and staff returning through staggered schedules while remote work continues until we are able to return to full-time campus operations. Compared to some other colleges and universities, we are taking a more conservative approach to the reopening of campus. Our priority continues to be the health and safety of all members of the community.
Update on fall semester planning
The Fall Working Group, co-chaired by Bruce Anderson, interim provost and Allison Gulati, vice president of student affairs and dean of students, consists of 19 faculty and staff members from across campus. They have done outstanding work evaluating various scenarios for the fall semester and outlining details for the implementation of these models, including varied teaching and learning modalities. Subgroups focused on the academic program, health & safety, equity & community and facilities & infrastructure. The Fall Planning Guiding Principles informed the research and analysis done by all subgroups. These principles focus on Muhlenbergâs mission, health & safety, equity & inclusion, adaptability and fiscal sustainability. Working group conclusions and College decisions are grounded in scientific evidence, guidance from the Collegeâs public health experts, as well as local healthcare providers, the Allentown Health Bureau, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Pennsylvania Department of Education, OSHA, and the CDC. We are fortunate that we have a strong partnership with the Lehigh Valley Health Network's Infectious Disease and Occupational Health departments who will be offering guidance on alteration of classrooms, office space, residence halls and common spaces to align with state prevention measures (e.g., social distancing, ventilation, etc.)
We expect a final decision about the fall semester communicated no later than July 1, but hope to share preliminary decisions about the fall sooner than that after further consultation with the fall planning group. We will continue to provide updates as we look ahead to the 2020-2021 academic year. 
Health and safety measures
When we do return to campus, you will see a campus transformed, through use of multiple COVID-19 preventative measures. For example, social distancing, face mask and hand-washing signage, labels and floor markings, installation of hands-free faucets, soap dispensers, paper towel holders, toilets and urinals, extensive cleaning and disinfecting and use of plexi-glass dividers in high traffic areas. Further, all employees on campus are required to wear a clean face covering (mask or cloth covering) every day. You may choose to wear a personal mask brought from home but if you do not have any, the College can supply single-use masks for those in need. These measures are consistent with the guidance we received from the state in their recently released report on reopening colleges and universities. 
We recognize that even when more of us are permitted to be back on campus, some of you may need to continue to work at home for health or personal reasons related to COVID-19. In line with the state guidance and in collaboration with fall working group members, we are developing protocols for determining flexible work schedules for faculty and staff that ensure the health and safety of individuals and maintain College operations. Relevant faculty committees, department chairs, and managers will be asked to provide feedback on these protocols. As a reminder, employees may contact Human Resources or our Employee Assistance Program, which is a free and confidential service for employees and their dependents, for additional resources. 
Thank you for your work in turbulent times
We continue to be grateful for the way our community has come together and adapted so quickly to remote teaching and work. We owe special thanks to the essential staff who have remained on campus to support our students and to care for College property. 
These past few months have been more challenging than we could have imagined. We know that the burdens of the COVID-19 heath crisis are not equally shared by all members of our community. For those who have health concerns, ill family members or have lost loved ones, there has been additional stress and anxiety. This pandemic has highlighted and deepened existing inequities in our country. Even more, the ongoing racial violence, which continues to cause indescribable harm and trauma for members of our Black community and individuals of color, further creates differential experiences compounded by this health crisis. 
Our strength is in our community and the path forward is through collaboration, equity-minded decision making and shared commitment to health and safety on campus. Thank you for everything you do to support the College and our students.
Stay safe and stay strong.Sincerely,
Kathy Harring, interim presidentBruce Anderson, interim provostAllison Gulati, vice president for student affairs and dean of studentsJill Walsh, vice president for human resources

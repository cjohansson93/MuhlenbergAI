On Thursday, January 20, 2004, Muhlenberg College will sponsor a celebration of the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This event is free and open to the public.
The Reverend Benjamin T. Hailey, Sr., senior pastor of the Union Baptist Church in Allentown, will deliver the keynote speech, “At What Price, Peace?” in Egner Memorial Chapel at 7:30 p.m.
Since Hailey’s installation in November 2003, the congregation at Union Baptist Church has more than doubled in membership. He is in the process of developing a non-profit community development center to meet the needs of the urban community surrounding the church. Hailey currently serves on the board of the United Way of the Lehigh Valley.
In addition to Hailey’s speech, there will be performances by the community-based group ACCO, A Chorus Celebrating Women, and the College’s step group, the Muhlenberg Soul Sound Steppers. Other students will share original choreography, recite works by influential poets such as Maya Angelou and Etheridge Knight and provide commentary on Dr. King’s life and work.
The celebration is co-sponsored by the College’s Office of Multi-Cultural Life and the Chapel.

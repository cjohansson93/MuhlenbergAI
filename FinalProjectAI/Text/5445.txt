two earn centennial conference nods



The Centennial Conference recognized two Muhlenberg athletes as players of the week in their respective sports.



Junior Ashley O’Grady was named defensive player of the week in women’s soccer. O’Grady headed a ball out of the goal in the early going to preserve 

what would be a 0-0 tie with Moravian. She also was part of a defensive effort that limited Washington to one shot. In the two games, the Muhlenberg defense allowed 
only three shots on goal in 200 shutout minutes.

Senior Megan Eiser (left) was named volleyball player of the week. She averaged 10.71 assists and 2.86 digs and added six kills and six blocks in a 2-0 week for the Mules. 
Eiser recorded a career-high 48 assists at Swarthmore and reached the career milestones of 2,000 assists and 900 digs in the Washington match. 
She is only the third member of the “A2K” club in Muhlenberg history.

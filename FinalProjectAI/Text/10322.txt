Muhlenberg College is an independent liberal arts institution located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, about fifty-five miles north of Philadelphia. With an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2,000 students, Muhlenberg is dedicated to shaping creative, compassionate, collaborative citizens through rigorous academic programs in the arts, humanities, natural sciences and social sciences, as well as select preprofessional programs.
Founded in 1848 as Allentown Seminary, the institution was renamed Muhlenberg College in 1867 and began providing a liberal arts education committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence.
Muhlenberg is unique among private colleges in offering programs in professional areas such as business, education, public health, media & communication and neuroscience in addition to the traditional liberal arts majors. The Muhlenberg curriculum provides opportunities for students in all programs to participate in research, community engagement, internships and study abroad options that provide critical experiences for students in todayâs rapidly changing world. The outstanding quality of the Muhlenberg academic program has been recognized by Phi Beta Kappa and some 15 additional national honorary societies with established chapters at the College. The College recently began offering graduate degrees in applied analytics and organizational leadership.
The College is committed to providing students with powerful outcomes. The Career Center and The Muhlenberg Network of alumni and parents help students and graduates benefit from their rewarding learning experience through internship and job placement programs. Muhlenberg graduates are prepared to meet their personal definitions of success while continuing to value service to others in ways both big and small.

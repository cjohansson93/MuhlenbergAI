Background
MEQ with Physics Emphasis B.S. - Physics / Kutztown University
I am a retired physics teacher having taught physics for 35 years at Parkland High School, Allentown, PA.
My hobbies include developing physics demonstrations and experiments, drawing, making stop-motion physics cartoons, painting, model railroading, reading about history, biking, and visiting museums. My favorite time of day is the morning at which time I enjoy drinking lots of coffee and reading the news or a good history book.
My credentials include a B.S. and a masters equivalency in physics. I have written numerous articles for professional journals, invented a best selling physics lab product for Sargent Welch, and received several awards and recognitions including:

The Da Vinci Science Center Master Teacher Award.
First place winner of the "Best Science Teachers Video Contest" at the US Science and Engineering Festival in Washington, DC.
The PBS Educational Visionary Award.
The Tandy/Radio Shack National Teachers Award.
Featured educator in Allentownâs Morning Call.

In addition I reviewed physics texbooks and lab procedures before publication for leading textbooks, made numerous presentations and ran numerous workshops throughout the country for The American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), served as an officer for the AAPT, hosted several physics demonstration shows over the years, and most recently wrote a âFiguring Physicsâ cartoon for âThe Physics Teacherâ journal.

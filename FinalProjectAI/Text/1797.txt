Safety and Emergency Policy and Procedures



Library Home|About Us|Policies|Safety and Emergency Policy






Safety and Emergency Policy
Policy Statement
Trexler Library is concerned about the safety of the students, faculty, staff, guests, and visitors at Trexler Library. In the event of an emergency, non-staff will look to staff for direction and assistance. As such, the library staff must be prepared to act in an emergency situation. Trexler Library will establish and maintain a process to educate new staff and to facilitate staff readiness on an ongoing basis.
Safety and Emergency Procedures
Purpose of Procedures
Campus Safety provides safety information including Crisis Response Guidelines for the campus on the Campus Safety section of the Muhlenberg website. The purpose of library procedures is to provide supplementary guidelines specific to Trexler Library. Additionally, the procedures provide a mechanism for educating staff so that staff are able and prepared to follow prescribed procedures.
Procedures
Safety Officer

The Safety Officer will serve for a term of at least 1 year.
Trexler Library will assign an individual to be the safety officer for the library. This person shall have the following responsibilities:

review with new employees the location of safety information and equipment for the library and Trexler Libraryâs procedures;
check the first aid kit at least twice during the year to remove expired items and replenish stock;
maintain and make available on the shared drive and in print form near main phones, documentation which includes:

safety procedures
location of safety equipment
location of emergency exits and emergency exit routes
a list of staff trained in first aid and/or CPR;


provide staff with updated information as it is available;
Participate as a liaison to any campus emergency procedures and practices planning process;
Prepare and maintain a safety training section for the student training manuals;
Plan and present a yearly review and update of safety information to staff.



Staff Preparedness
Each staff member should be familiar with the following:

Location of fire extinguishers, fire exits, and fire exit routes;
Location of and proper use of emergency and campus phones;
Location of first aid kit;
Know which staff members are trained in emergency first aid/CPR.

Emergency Response

The immediate actions for the following types of emergencies are specified in the Campus Safety Crisis Response Guidelines:

Fires and/or explosion
Crime in progress/civil disturbance
Injuries or illness
Bomb threat
Chemical or radiation spill
Earthquake
Shooting protocol


In addition, the following protocols should be used for Trexler Library:

Evacuation and Emergency Escape Procedures

In the event of an alarm sounding or other notice of evacuation, all persons including students, faculty, staff, and visitors should leave the building by the closest available exit in an orderly manner and using posted emergency evacuation routes, if they are safe. Staff should provide reasonable assistance in alerting and evacuating patrons if the situation permits.

Accountability for Employees

In the event of an emergency evacuation, supervisors or designees should account for the employees in their immediate work area or unit. Any employee(s) unaccounted for should be reported to emergency response personnel immediately. Because supervisors are responsible for accounting for employees, it is imperative that all staff reassemble in the designated evacuation site after evacuation. In accordance with the Emergency Response Manual provided by the Department of Campus Safety, the designated evacuation site for the library is the lawn to the east of the library. If the east lawn is not safe, use your best judgment in choosing an alternate location and notify emergency response personnel of your location as soon as reasonably possible.


Evacuation of Persons with Disabilities

In the event of an emergency evacuation, persons with mobility impairment who may be on Level B or Level C must use their own discretion to determine if using the elevator is more of a risk than waiting for rescue personnel to reach them.
If a person with mobility impairment does not utilize a wheelchair, but could benefit from assistance during an evacuation, any available office or computer lab chair with rollers may be used.
If a person with a mobility impairment is unable to evacuate, staff should notify emergency response personnel immediately so that they can provide assistance. This is not to imply that any staff member is prohibited from offering this type of evacuation assistance during and emergency.






Injury or Illness

Muhlenberg College Emergency Medical Service â x3110
Allentown Emergency Services â 911

The accompanying form should be used to record any significant injury reported to staff. Information recorded should include: date, time, name(s), description of injury, reported description of cause, action taken, and employee name.
Minor injury or illness : In case of a minor injury or illness, students may go to the Student Health Center.
Major injury or illness : In addition to the guidelines provided under the section âInjury or Illnessâ in the Emergency Response Manual, the following should be noted:

If conscious and oriented, the individual has the right and responsibility to determine his/her own health care needs and the response to those needs.
In circumstances involving a person who is unconscious and/or not oriented, calling Muhlenberg Emergency Services (via Campus Safety) is the appropriate response.
If Campus Safety is unavailable or does not respond, contact Allentown Emergency Services â 911. Give your name, the approximate age of the victim, describe the nature and severity of the medical problem, and provide the campus location of the victim. Do not hang up until released by the emergency operator.









Notification of Supervisors and the Library Director

The shift supervisor should be notified directly of any emergency situation as soon as possible.
The Library Director should be notified directly of any major emergency as soon as possible

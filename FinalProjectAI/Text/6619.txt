The first home wrestling match in two years for the Muhlenberg wrestling team was not in its normal home: The Mules squared off against Scranton in the John Deitrich
Fieldhouse as part of Scotty Wood Weekend.

Muhlenberg won two of the three contested bouts. Scranton picked up six wins by forfeit to win the match, 45-9.

At 141, freshman Che Chengsupanimit recorded his second pin of the season midway through the third period, and at 149, senior Matt Parker
(right) won a 7-3 decision.

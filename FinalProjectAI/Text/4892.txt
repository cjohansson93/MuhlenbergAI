track and field teams strike gold


It was a tremendous day for the entire Muhlenberg track and field family, and especially the Faust family, at the Centennial Conference Championships.

Both Mule teams finished third, the best combined

showing for the program in four years. The teams brought back a program-record nine gold medals and four school records.

The Muhlenberg women swept the Most Outstanding Performer awards. The only time that had happened previously in program history was when the men did it at the 2003 outdoor meet, and no women’s team had ever won both since the CC began giving separate awards in 2003.

Senior Jennifer Lynch earned top honors for track events. She earned gold medals in the mile and 3,000 meters and finished fourth in the 800. In the mile, Lynch beat out a Johns Hopkins runner who holds the CC record in the event and currently has the third-fastest mile in Division III this season.

For the second time in her career, senior Alex Faust was named Most Outstanding Performer for field events. She became the third woman in CC history to win the same event (pole vault) four times, breaking her own meet record in the process. Faust also won the 200 and 400, setting school records in both, and anchored the 4x400 relay team that finished third.

On the relay, Faust took the baton from her

younger sister, freshman Colette Faust, who won the high jump.

Take away the two outstanding seniors, and most of the rest of the women’s points came from freshmen and sophomores. The Mules scored 97 points, up from 74 last year, when they also finished third.

The individuals may have been the story on the women’s side, but for the men it was the relays. Muhlenberg failed to defend its 2009 gold medals in the 4x800 and distance medley relay, but instead won the other two relays, the 4x200 and 4x400.

The 4x200 quartet of sophomore Peter Rice, freshman Isaiah Vaughn and seniors Brendan Kirk and Jeremiah Lachaud broke a seven-year-old school record, finishing in 1:32.99. Rice and Kirk then joined with senior Bill Ryan and sophomore Chris Lysenko to win the final event of the meet, the 4x400.

The Mules’ other first-place finish came from sophomore Marc Brookland, who long jumped a personal-best 21-8¼ on his final attempt to wrest the gold away from the two-time defending champion. Brookland also added a silver medal in the triple jump.

Rice set a school record in the 200 while finishing second and took bronze in the 400. Lachaud notched a personal-best time in the 55 to place second, and Kirk earned a silver in the 55 high hurdles.

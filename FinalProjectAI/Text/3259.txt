Snow shoots 70 to win g’burg tourney


Senior Bill Snow shot a 2-under-par 70 to earn medalist honors and lead the Muhlenberg men’s golf team to its third second-place finish of the fall at the Gettysburg Fall Invitational.

The score was the lowest by a Mule since Matt Berman carded a 70 to win the Susquehanna Tee-Off Tournament in March 2001, but that came on a par-70 course. 

Snow (left) won by two strokes over a Dickinson golfer to capture his second career tournament. He finished first at the Susquehanna Fall Invitational last year with a 73, which was his previous career-low round.

“I was one under through five, and then I made a double bogey. That kind of brought me back to reality,” Snow said. “I birdied the next two holes, and from there I took advantage of the short par fives.

“It’s nice to see all the workouts paying off,” he added.

Muhlenberg finished five strokes behind York. Sophomore Jordan Carpenter tied for ninth in the field of 56 by shooting a 78.

We offer a nine-course major and five-course minor in English Literatures as well as an opportunity to concentrate in Pre K-4, 4-8 and secondary education. Most classes are taught in discussion-structured seminars, with course topics ranging from Jane Austen to Contemporary Poetry to Holocaust Literatures.
Renowned scholars visit campus each year through the Brown Lecture series. This lecture is scheduled alongside our yearly Honors in English Literatures presentation. Guest writers regularly visit campus and read from their work and offer workshops on writing craft as part of our Living Writers, Writers-at-Muhlenberg or Emerging Writers series.
Top students are invited to join the International English Honors Society Sigma Tau Delta and our local chapter, Gamma Iota. Our chapter publishes the Muhlenberg Academic Review, an interdisciplinary journal of student writing.

Technology is an integral part of our daily livesâboth at home and at work. Muhlenbergâs computer science program combines theory and practice to provide students with the foundation and experience essential to work in a variety of technology-driven fields. Students learn the principles and foundation of computational methodsâincluding their implementation and analysesâfor application in a wide-range of industries.

Our expert faculty are passionate teachers and mentors who work closely with students both in class and beyond. Students find a collaborative department with hands-on learning and group projects that foster the kind of teamwork essential in computer science and in high demand from employers.
Muhlenbergâs newly upgraded computer class environments include state-of-the-art workstations, individual workstation servers, projection systems and more. These labs have the Appstream Virtual Lab integrated with Google Drive, providing access to files from any application. Programs such as Python, Anaconda, IDLE, and Maple are available for use at any time. The Office of Information Technology maintains a campus-wide computing network that includes 16 computer labs in both academic and residential buildings, and five special purpose labsâproviding access to specialized softwareâwith approximately 80 PCs, 45 Chromebooks and 34 Macs available. Students also have access to a number of application packages, including Appstream Virtual Lab, which provides students and faculty remote access to campus standard software normally available in physical labs on campus.






Opportunities with Impact
Learning theory in the classroom is only part of the equation that equals success after graduation. Computer science majors will find a variety of opportunities to practically apply the theory and principles they learn in course through research, internships and independent study.
The Lehigh Valley is the fastest-growing region in Pennsylvania and is home to a large number of companies who rely on technologyâfrom tech start-ups and manufacturing to health care and communicationsâproviding a wide array of internship options. Those who choose to pursue research, including alumni-funded opportunities, often present their findings to peers at both regional and national professional conferences.
Powerful Outcomes
The computer science major at Muhlenberg prepares students for whatâs next, whether they choose to begin their careers after graduation or pursue graduate study. With an increasing emphasis on data mining and analytics, our computer science program develops students into confident, critical problem-solvers who create innovative solutions to complex challenges. They are able to explain and apply advanced concepts in three or more programming languages from two or more different paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic), as well as analyze, design and apply advanced data structures and algorithms. These foundational skills prepare them to apply their degree in technology-related fields across a wide array of industries. Many of our graduates take traditional career paths, becoming programmers, developers and analysts. But others choose to pair computer science with other interests as minors or double majors, using their technology and computational skills in specialized fields from art and public health to economics and international studies.

Women's Soccer Scores Early, Hangs on for Tie
 Wednesday, September 5, 2012 - page 3







					 



After just five-and-a-half minutes, the women’s soccer game between Muhlenberg and Montclair State was already tied 1-1. Nearly 105 minutes later, it was still tied 1-1.

The teams traded early headers off corner kicks, and that was all the scoring as the Mules played to a draw in their first road game of the season.

Just 78 seconds after the Red Hawks (2-0-1) scored their goal, the Mules (1-1-1) responded, with senior Alyssa Meola heading in classmate Natalie Wizel’s corner for the second time in three games. Meola (left) has scored a goal in every game this season.

To say Montclair had the better of play the rest of the game would be an understatement. Muhlenberg did not get another corner kick or shot in the game, but stayed even with the hosts thanks to the goalkeeping of Amanda Wong.

The junior made eight saves, including a spectacular stop with about 20 minutes left in regulation, when she punched the ball over the crossbar to stop a one-on-one from close range. Wong had to be removed from the game after colliding with a charging Montclair player with 20 seconds left in the second overtime, but she held on to the ball to preserve the tie.

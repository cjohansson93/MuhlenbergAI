women’s lacrosse posts historic win


Having never defeated Ursinus, the Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team entered the game with all odds against it, but the players had a plan of their own.

The Mules (5-2) made themselves the perfect Easter present with a 13-8 triumph over

the visiting Bears, claiming their first Centennial Conference win of the season.

Second Quarter Does In Men’s Lax 


A week after the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team almost claimed a victory against No. 8 Washington (Md.), the squad had to contend with another national powerhouse – No. 2 Gettysburg. 

Following the first quarter, which ended 2-2, it looked like the Mules might give a hard time to the Bullets, but the hosts came out strong in the second period, establishing an eight-goal lead, 10-2, and thwarting Muhlenberg’s hopes of an upset.

At the end of the day, Gettysburg secured a 16-5 victory, keeping its undefeated record (7-0) intact.

For the Mules, senior Kyle Farris finished with two goals, bringing his career total to 76. He needs only one two more goals to surpass first-place Doug Cornwell and become the most prolific scorer in team history.

record (3-0) during the 2008 campaign, while snapping an 18-game losing streak against the Bears in a series that dates back to 1990. 
Muhlenberg had never limited Ursinus to single-digit goals, but today’s matchup was a different story.

“We worked together in defense and everybody was seeing the field really well,” Lane said.

Sophomore Alyssa Bascelli broke a scoreless deadlock in the sixth minute, converting a free position shot to give Muhlenberg a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. The Mules scored four of the next five goals to open a 5-1 cushion before Ursinus (2-3) scored two quick goals in the last two minutes of the first half to cut the deficit to two.

The teams traded goals at the beginning of the second half, shaping a 7-5 score in Muhlenberg’s favor with 23 minutes remaining. From that moment on, the Mules dominated the game, going onto 4-0 run following goals by juniors Sara Hiller and Ruth Morrongiello, sophomore Amanda McGovern and Bascelli.

Bascelli finished with a career-high four goals, while freshman Rachael Goldstein, who returned to the team after missing two games, scored her second hat trick on the season and added three ground balls.
 
Muhlenberg, which entered the game second in the CC in shooting percentage, confirmed its reputation of an accurate shooting team as the squad connected on 13 of its 25 attempts to score.

Thanks to the win, playoffs are not any more a mirage for the squad, which had lost its first two CC encounters. Ursinus has made the CC playoffs every year since 2001. 

“The win is a stepping stone in the right direction to get to the playoffs,” said Lane, who along with junior Megan Wilson finished with a team-leading four ground balls.

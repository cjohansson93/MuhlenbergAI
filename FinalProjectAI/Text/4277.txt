heartbreak for baseball in second game



A rough Spring Break trip for the Muhlenberg baseball team got even rougher when Salve Regina scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh, negating a Mule rally in the top of the inning, to win the second game of a doubleheader, 10-9.

The Seahawks (2-1) won the first game, 6-3.

Muhlenberg (2-9-1), looking for its first win in Florida, trailed 7-4 when it came to bat in the top of the seventh. A double by junior Nick Busillo and double play brought in three runs to tie the score. Senior Jeff Puklin brought in the go-ahead run with a single, then scored an insurance run on a single from sophomore Joseph Vila.

Salve Regina pieced together a single, three walks and two hit batters to win the game in the bottom of the inning.

Busillo drove in three runs, and junior Jesse Nusbaum (right) was 2-for-3 with three runs scored. Freshman Brett Rosen went 3-for-4.

In the opening game, Salve Regina scored five runs in the first three innings. Sophomore Ryan Rechten pitched four innings of one-hit relief, allowing just one unearned run.

Muhlenberg honors students during Undergraduate Research Week


First recognized in 2011 by the U.S. House of Representatives, Undergraduate Research Week is sponsored each year by the Council for Undergraduate Research. 


	 Wednesday, April 15, 2015  02:19 PM

Held this year between April 13 - April 17, the designation is intended to focus a spotlight on the young researchers who conduct research at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities across the country.
Each year, Muhlenberg students conduct independent research projects with faculty mentors across a variety of academic disciplines in the sciences, humanities and the arts.

This past summer, over 50 students were awarded a stipend and no-cost on-campus housing for the duration of their research. Funding sources include the Faculty-Student Collaborative Research Grant from the Provost's Office, academic departments, the National Science Foundation and generous scholarships founded by Muhlenberg alumni.
A poster series featuring photos of student researchers, along with information about their research interests and faculty mentors, is on display in Seegers Union Light Lounge through April 17. The display is free and open to the public.

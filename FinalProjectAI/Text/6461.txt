Volleyball Flattens Bryn Mawr in Three Sets
 Wednesday, October 3, 2012 - page 2







					 



Sophomore Lindsey Gambocurta may have had nine kills in the Muhlenberg volleyball team’s 3-0 shutout of Bryn Mawr, but it was one of her four digs that was the most stylish.



With the Mules leading 14-8 in the third set, the Owls looked like they would score a point on an attack attempt down the line. But Gambocurta dove and rescued the ball from the hardwood with a pancake dig. Freshman Vanessa Pulice took the pass and set it for freshman Katherine Boll, who put away a kill to make it 15-8.

Bryn Mawr never got closer than six points again as Muhlenberg (9-6, 2-3) finished off an impressive 25-14, 25-16, 25-13 win.

“It was a great feeling, especially since we put it down right afterward,” said Gambocurta. “I have the secret [to pancake digs]  I don’t know what it is, but I can seem to tell where the ball is going to go. In high school they always called me ‘Pancake.’”

Gambocurta’s defensive play stood out in a match that was more about offense. The Mules scored 40 of their 75 points on kills and hit a season-high .306. Boll led the way with 13 kills and a .476 percentage. Freshman Sarah Weyhumuller (left) added seven kills.

Pulice ran the efficient offense, piling up 30 assists.

The Mules won all three sets decisively, jumping out leads of 15-3 in the first, 14-6 in the second and 8-2 in the third. Bryn Mawr (5-11, 1-4), on the other hand, scored more than three straight points only once.

“We had a lot of runs,” said Gambocurta. “And even when we gave up points, we picked each other up, got right back and ran with it.”

The Mules hope to keep running with it after picking up their first win in more than two weeks. After they played just three matches in a span of 17 days, this was the first of nine scheduled matches in 11 days, including key Centennial Conference contests against Washington and Franklin & Marshall.

“This win was very crucial because we lost to Dickinson [on Saturday],” said Gambocurta. “That was a match we felt we should win, and we need to win those matches if we are going to get back into the conference [playoff race]. I think everyone was aware of how important this match was.”

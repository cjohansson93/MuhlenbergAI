Field hockey rattles cage to top Owls 


All season long the Muhlenberg field hockey team has been searching for more offense.

On Tuesday night, the Mules finally found the scoring touch that had been eluding them all season. Muhlenberg got a pair of goals from Tiffany Kreider and Jillian Katz to cruise past Bryn Mawr, 6-0, at Scotty Wood Stadium.




DiMarco picked up her second assist of the season.




Katz got the scoring started less than seven minutes into the game when she redirected a pass from Amanda DiMarco past the Owl goalie.

Weve been wanting more goals all season, so to score six was really big, Katz said. Weve definitely picked up our play in the second half and have stuck together all year, so this felt really good.

Less than 10 minutes after Katz got the scoring started, Kreider joined in with the first of her two penalty stroke goals.

At the 21:25 mark of the first half, Dayna Hovern found Erin Cummings alone on the back post. Hovern put a pass on Cummings' stick, and the freshman turned and finished for the goal.

Kreider finally ended the first-half scoring when she went top shelf on her second penalty stroke of the night to give the Mules a 4-0 halftime lead.

Almost everything went Muhlenbergs way as the Mules (2-11, 2-5) maintained control throughout. Playing most of the game in or around the Bryn Mawr (0-11, 0-8) circle, Muhlenberg held a 51-3 advantage in shots and racked up 19 penalty corners. The Mules also took advantage of three penalty strokes.

Three minutes into the second half, Katz picked up where the Mules left off when scored off a rocket of a pass from Kreider to push the advantage to five. And finally, Hovern ended the scoring when she converted a penalty stroke with less than 10 minutes to play to make it 6-0.

The six goals was Muhlenbergs most since 2008, and was a welcomed outburst in a season in which goals have been hard to come by.  

According to senior captain Chessie Martinez, 






Hoverns second-half penalty stroke moved her into a tie for the Mule scoring lead.






it took the youthful Mules some time to gel, and Tuesdays offensive output was result of a team that is more comfortable on the field. 

Weve really grown and learned how to work with each other and play as one on the field, she said. We really pulled through today and played together as a unit. This felt really good because we finally got a chance to really rattle the back of the cage.

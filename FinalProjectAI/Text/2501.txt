Allentown photographer Marco Calderon’s Fighters is a powerful photographic essay of young boxers training at the Allentown Boxing and Youth Program located at 402 Ridge Street.  He posed and lighted the young men, women and children with all the attention and respect he might give to more typical portrait work.  He has made a convincing effort to encourage viewers to look and think more deeply into the driving forces behind those who train.  To consider their goals and acknowledge the hard work, determination and discipline it takes to achieve them. Fighters reminds us to make space for youth to pursue their dreams and to tell their stories. Marco Calderon: Fighters runs October 8 - 19 in the Galleria Lobby of the Baker Center for the Arts.  Hours are daily 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM.

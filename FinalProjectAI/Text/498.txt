Space of Play, Play of Space 
September 18 â November 2, 2019 
Errant Globe, 2015 Soccer ball bladder, globe stand 14â  
We are pleased to host Ronny Quevedo for his multi-site solo exhibition, Space of Play, Play of Space, in the Martin Art Gallery and in a field drawing adjacent to Trexler Library on campus.   We will hold an opening reception on September 18, from 5:30 â 7:00pm. Additionally, Quevedo will give an artist talk on October 15th at 7:00pm, in the Recital Hall, adjacent to the Gallery as the second Center for Ethics talk, exploring the theme of the Borders, Nationalisms, Identities.  Quevedoâs Gallery exhibition will be complemented by a field-sized drawing measuring 175 x 125 feet.  Being over twenty thousand square feet means this dynamic work is viewable in the round from nearby sidewalks and streets. Visitors are encouraged to directly engage with the work by walking on - and through the field, which is centrally located on Muhlenberg College Campus.  This new drawing will be renewed over the course of the exhibition, continuing through November 2.   
This multi-site exhibition locates the viewer as competitor in an imaginary, negotiated space of play. A metaphor for shifting global landscapes, Quevedo interrogates notions of borders and boundaries to explore our relationship to nationalisms, territory, and migration.  Space of Play, Play of Space is an investigation of the self through the games we play by magnifying the role of migration within that transformation. 
The parallels between play and migration generate from New York City indoor and outdoor soccer leagues. Played on weekends at public schools and parks, leagues are coordinated and operated by migrant Latin American and Caribbean communities. Quevedoâs personal experience intersects with this cultural site as the artist attended weekly games with his father, a player and referee.

Ronny Quevedo (b.1981, Guayaquil, Ecuador) works in a variety of mediums including sculpture and drawing. Quevedoâs work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at The Whitney Museum of American Art; Perez Art Museum Miami; Elizabeth Dee Gallery; The Drawing Center; the Queens Museum; The Bronx Museum of the Arts; and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, amongst others. He is a recipient of the 2017 Blade of Grass Fellowship for Socially Engaged Art and the 2016 Queens Museum/Jerome Foundation Fellowship for Emerging Artists. He has participated in residencies at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Kala Art Institute, the Core Program at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Project Row Houses, Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture, and Lower East Side Printshop. He has been published in Hyperallergic and Art Forum. Quevedo received his MFA from the Yale School of Art in 2013 and BFA from The Cooper Union in 2003.

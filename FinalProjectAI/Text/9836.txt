In-person college fairs have been suspended at present due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. We anticipate a return to in-person college fairs in the fall of 2022. Department representatives frequently attend college fairs around the country, to meet you and answer your questions.
Meanwhile, we encourage you to contact us with your questions and interests. We would love to set up a one-on-one "college fair," answer your questions, and get to know you.

The Dorothy Hess Baker Theatre is the jewel in the crown of the Trexler Pavilion, completed in 1999. An elegant but intimate Broadway-style proscenium theatre, the Baker seats 342 on two levels, orchestra and balcony.

Fully equipped with state-of-the-art stage sound and lighting systems, orchestra pit, and fly system, the Baker Theatre is used for Department productions of plays, dance concerts, and smaller musicals, as well as Summer Music Theatre productions, concerts, and special events.

The Trexler Pavilion was built in 1999 to meet the demands of a growing Theatre & Dance program and to extend our performance and presenting opportunities for our students and the community. The Pavilion's defining architectural feature is its sweeping curved glass facade, enclosing the front of the Baker Theatre and two levels of lobby space â known affectionately among students as "the Fishbowl," a favorite spot for student meetings and scene rehearsal.
The Trexler Pavilion for Theatre & Dance also houses the Department offices, scene shop, costume shop, rehearsal halls, the box office, and two smaller Studio Theatres. It also houses the "Lavender Lounge" â a student lounge, green room and dressing rooms.

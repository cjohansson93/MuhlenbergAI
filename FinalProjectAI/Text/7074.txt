Soccer Teams Pick up Key CC Wins

The Muhlenberg soccer teams improved their Centennial Conference positioning with victories over Washington College.

Men’s soccer used offensive contributions from a pair of unexpected sources to pull away and earn a 3-1 decision against the Shoremen. Senior midfielder Jeremy Katz scored the first goal of his career, and senior back Jonathan Schauer nodded in a header for his first tally of the season as the Mules (6-5, 2-2) finally found some offense and bounced back from a tough loss at nationally ranked Swarthmore on Wednesday.




Schauer (20) celebrates his game-winning goal.



Junior midfielder Lance Dotzman put the finishing touches on the victory with his sixth goal of the season, latching on to a picture-perfect cross from classmate Jeff Reinhart and heading it home in the 65th minute. Easily the Mules’ leading scorer, Dotzman’s goal hardly came as a surprise. The first two certainly did.

Katz broke a scoreless tie in the 32nd minute, corralling a ball over the top from senior Brendan McIntyre, settling it with his chest, and firing a right-footed shot past a diving Washington goalie. Katz had recorded just a single point prior to his impressive strike.

“I was making a diagonal run, and [McIntyre] chipped it over the top,” Katz recalled. “I thought there was a defender on my back, and I was just trying to make contact. I didn’t want to roof it over the goal. It was just good placement, and it went in.

“I was just trying not to mess up.”

Mission accomplished and then some for Katz and the Mules, who watched the Shoremen net an equalizer late in the first half only to put the game away with a pair of goals in a short stretch of the second. Schauer deposited the game-winner in the 60th minute, locking on to a loose ball in the box and heading it into the right corner of the net for his fourth career goal. 

Six minutes later, Reinhart tracked down a ball on the right flank, sprinted past a defender, and sent in a perfect cross to Dotzman, who calmly put a header into the net for a 3-1 lead and one of the Mules’ best offensive performances of the season. Muhlenberg had scored less than two goals in eight of its first 10 games, and had reached three only once – a 4-0 shutout of Moravian nearly four weeks ago.

“We hadn’t scored in the run of play in quite a few games,” Katz said. “It was good to finally get one in that we had been practicing, when Jeff cut it in to Lance. Three goals is much better, especially in the conference. Every one is a close game, and it was good to get a two-goal victory.”

Now back at the break-even mark in conference play, Katz believes the Mules are primed for a strong finish to the season.

“We’re not scared of anybody,” Katz said. “We feel good.”

Women’s soccer, meanwhile, got a goal from freshman Abby Lazofsky and held on for a 1-0 shutout of the Shorewomen. Senior goalie Amanda Wong made four saves for the Mules (5-5-1, 3-1), who posted a 1-0 decision for the second time in three games after winning at Dickinson by the same score a week ago.

Lazofsky (right) broke the ice in the 60th minute off a corner kick. Senior Stephanie Tramutola sent a ball into the box, and classmate CJ Graetzer was there to flick it to Lazofsky, who completed the sequence with her fourth goal of the season. 

The tally gave Graetzer her first assist of the season, while Tramutola nabbed her second. Wong made a pair of stops down the stretch to seal the final result.

The victory vaulted the Mules into second place in the CC standings, just a half-game behind undefeated and top-ranked Johns Hopkins.

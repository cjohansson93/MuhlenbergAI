Kimberly Nguyen Convicted: A Short Documentary Film
The documentary film Convicted explores the criminal justice system through the voices and images of the involved parties - a judge, a district attorney, a defense attorney, and two individuals, one indicted and one convicted. Popular shows such as "Law and Order" have contributed to the production of societal misconceptions involving the justice system. This project portrays reality-on a local level. Shot in downtown Allentown, this film illustrates the difficulties of each perspective, while working to provoke fresh thought. This project was produced through Dr. Tafler's course, Video Production. Through this course, I was encouraged to take risks and question standard thoughts involving justice and the legal process. Convicted depicts the emotions, the frustrations, and the dilemmas experienced by all those involved - and examines the popular perception that people are guilty until proven innocent.

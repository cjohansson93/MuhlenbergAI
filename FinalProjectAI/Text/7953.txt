Volleyball, Field Hockey in Playoffs; Women's Soccer Close

The Muhlenberg volleyball and field hockey teams clinched playoff berths while the women’s soccer team had its
pursuit of a playoff berth put on hold.

Volleyball split a trimatch at Gettysburg, defeating the hosts in four sets before falling to Messiah in five. The opening
win ensured the Mules (23-5, 7-2) a spot in the Centennial Conference playoffs for the second straight year; last season, they
reached the championship match.

Muhlenberg can secure a first-round bye with a win against Ursinus in its home finale on Wednesday.


In the opener, the Mules took the final two sets to break a 1-1 tie and score their first win ever at Gettysburg. Junior
Katherine Boll led all players with 13 kills, while senior Nikki Dickson (20 assists, 11 digs)
and sophomore Allison Glass (10 kills, 14 digs) both recorded double-doubles.

After dropping the second set and falling behind 4-2 in the third, Muhlenberg scored the next four points and never
trailed again. Junior Chelsea Kaser, who recorded a match-high 19 digs, served the final
five points of the third set and had a run of six straight service points to get the Mules out to a big lead in the third.

The match against regionally ranked Messiah was a back-and-forth contest in which Muhlenberg
handily won the first set, 25-9, only to have the Falcons (22-6) take the next two. The Mules forced a fifth
set with a 25-19 win in the fourth. The tense fifth set featured seven lead changes, with Messiah scoring
the last three points to pull it out, 16-14.

Glass had another double-double with 15 kills and 17 digs, and junior Joanne Josephson
(11 kills, 9 blocks) narrowly missed one. 

A pair of Mules reached season milestones on the day. Kaser went over 400 digs and become 
only the third Mule to have two seasons with 400 or more. Boll (right) had 10 blocks in the two matches to give her
101 for the year, making her only the second Muhlenberg player to reach triple digits.

Field hockey, which won last night, officially clinched a playoff berth when both Dickinson and Washington lost.
The Mules (11-3, 7-2), currently in third place, will make their second straight CC playoff appearance.

Women’s soccer lost 2-0 at regionally ranked Gettysburg. The Bullets (11-3-1, 7-0-1) scored
once in each half and denied the Mules their best scoring chance with a diving save off a quick shot in transition late in the
first half.

The Mules (10-4-2, 6-3) are still very much in contention for a playoff berth – thanks to a win by Ursinus against Dickinson,
Muhlenberg is in sole possession of third place with one CC match, at home next Saturday against Ursinus, remaining.

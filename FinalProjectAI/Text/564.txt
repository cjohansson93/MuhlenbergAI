ITL 101. Elementary Italian I - 1 course unitElementary Italian I provides an interactive introduction to the language and culture of contemporary Italy. This course uses a unique program designed specifically for Muhlenberg students and based on Spunti, a free, multimedia curriculum authored by Muhlenberg faculty. Grammar and vocabulary are taught through a dynamic, student-centered and culturally rich approach, enabling students to learn through communication. Class is conducted almost entirely in Italian. ITL 101 is intended for students with little to no knowledge of Italian. Assignment by placement test. Four class hours per week.
 
ITL 102. Elementary Italian II - 1 course unit This course begins with a brief review of the topics covered in ITL 101, and then builds upon that foundation to expand and strengthen studentsâ language skills and knowledge of contemporary Italian culture. Like ITL 101, this course provides an interactive introduction to the language and culture of contemporary Italy. We use a unique program designed specifically for Muhlenberg students and based on Spunti, a free, multimedia curriculum authored by Muhlenberg faculty. Grammar and vocabulary are taught through a dynamic, student-centered and cuturally rich approach, enabling students to learn through communication. Class is conducted almost entirely in Italian. ITL 102 is intended for students with a limited knowledge of Italian. Assignment by placement test. Four class hours per week.
 
ITL 203. Intermediate Italian I - 1 course unit This course is the first semester of the Intermediate Italian language sequence. Students continue to deepen and refine their knowledge and command of Italian language and culture, building upon the skills acquired in Elementary Italian. This course uses a unique program designed specifically for Muhlenberg students and based on Spunti, a free, multimedia curriculum authored by Muhlenberg faculty. Italian 203 uses authentic examples of Italian cultural production, such as films, songs, commercials, and literary excerpts, as the starting points (or spunti) for analysis of grammar and exploration of contemporary Italian culture and society. Each spunto provides varied activities for the improvement of studentsâ linguistic and cultural competence in a dynamic and communicative environment. This class is designed for students with a strong foundation in basic Italian. Assignment by placement test. Three class hours per week.
 
ITL 204. Intermediate Italian II - 1 course unitThis course is the second semester of the Intermediate Italian language sequence. Students continue to deepen and refine their knowledge and command of Italian language and culture. This course uses a unique program designed specifically for Muhlenberg students and based on Spunti, a free, multimedia curriculum authored by Muhlenberg faculty. Italian 204 uses authentic examples of Italian cultural production, such as films, songs, commercials, and literary excerpts, as the starting points (or spunti) for analysis of grammar and exploration of contemporary Italian culture, society, and history. Each spunto provides varied activities for the improvement of studentsâ linguistic and cultural competence in a dynamic and communicative environment. This class is designed for students with a strong foundation in basic Italian and some facility with more complex grammatical structures. Assignment by placement test. Three class hours per week. 
 
ITL 387. Advanced Italian: Texts in Context - 1 course unitThis course gives students the opportunity to refine their Italian language skills (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) and deepen their knowledge of Italian history, art and culture. Study of advanced grammar and stylistics takes place within the context of reading, viewing and discussing authentic artifacts of Italian cultural production, including novellas, films, poems, visual art, journalism, essays, television programs, and music. Students learn to analyze Italian texts in relation to the culture that gave rise to them, in order to achieve a deep and nuanced understanding of contemporary Italian language and culture. To this end students also engage in regular conversation with native speakers of Italian. This course is taught in Italian. This course is designed for students who have completed the Intermediate sequence or who place comparably on the placement test. Three course hours per week.

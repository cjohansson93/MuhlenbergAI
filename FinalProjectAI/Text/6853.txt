Rechten Ties Saves Record as Baseball Wins 20th
 Tuesday, April 30, 2013 - page 2







					 


Thirteen times over the last three seasons, the opponent had plans to come back in the late innings against the Muhlenberg baseball team,
but Ryan Rechten wrecked ’em.




Senior Robert Appleby made his first start of the season as the designated hitter and went 1-for-3.


The hard-throwing senior righthander tied a school record with his 13th career save by working the final three innings of the Mules’ 9-2 win against
Drew.
 
The win, in the team’s final home game, gave Muhlenberg (20-19) the fourth 20-win season in program history.




Rechten, who struck out five in his three-inning stint, is tied for second in team history with 57 career appearances.



Rechten began his Mule career as a long reliever and spot starter before emerging as the full-time closer last year. He saved seven games,
one shy of the school record, as a junior.

“I keep the same mentality [as a reliever and a starter],” said Rechten. “I trust in my stuff and trust in my teammates behind me.”

Rechten said he likes pitching in pressure situations, and even though he was scheduled to get the opportunity for a three-inning save all
along, he entered the game in the seventh in a traditional save chance, with Muhlenberg ahead by three runs after a solid six-inning, one-run start by sophomore Nick Gies.

The Mules scored three two-out runs in the first on a two-run double by junior Nick Kennedy and RBI single by junior
Brett Rosen. Rosen added another two-out RBI single – one of four hits he had in the game – in the third.

The Rangers (18-22) got a run back in the fourth and scored an unearned run off Rechten in the seventh on two walks, a bunt hit and an 
infield error to make it 4-2. 

Muhlenberg pushed its lead back to three in the seventh, with Kennedy motoring around from first 
when Rosen’s double down the third-base line was misplayed, then broke the game open with four in the eighth.

Sophomore Michael Giordano, playing in the first varsity game of his career, started the big rally with his first hit. With
one out and the bases loaded, sophomore Jimmy Cody singled in a pair, and one out later Kennedy singled to right for
his 100th career hit, bringing in two more.

All that was left was for Rechten to finish things off, and he did so with style, striking out the side in the ninth, including the last two hitters
with the bases loaded. And proving that he has embraced the closer’s mentality, Rechten immediately turned his attention to the next
game (the season finale at DeSales).

“It feels great to tie the record,” he said. “I hope I get another one tomorrow.”

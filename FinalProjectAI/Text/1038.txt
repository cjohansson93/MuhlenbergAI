MILE Property Lottery 2022-2023
Welcome to the 2022-2023 MILE property lottery process! The MILE property lottery gives upperclass students the unique possibility of selecting an apartment or house style living arrangement for the following academic year. You will find on this website a tentative list of available properties with descriptions and the MILE house application form with guidelines.
The MILE application now has two steps- an individual application and a group application. The Individual Application is due Friday, February 4, 2022.
Individuals must apply to see if they are eligible before the group can submit a group application for one of the "sub lotteries" for each group size (5,4,3,2). For example, a group that receives number 1 in the 4 person process has number 1 out of the groups that applied for 4-Person MILE only. Each group receives one number for the group in the group size the group applied for. The priority is based on a seniority average of each group. For further details on where your group would fall on the priority in the lottery please see this chart: MILEPriority.pdf
The suites at âThe Villageâ and the suites at 2201 Chew Street are included in the MILE lottery process. For descriptions of these properties and all the other MILE properties please consult the MILE Property List.
Once you have received your individual approval, you MUST submit a group application in order to participate in MILE Lottery.
Neighborly Hints- must be read before completing MILE Application

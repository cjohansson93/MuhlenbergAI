About Me: Iâm a Muhlenberg alum, class of 2010, from Baltimore, Maryland. After exploring several majors, I graduated with a degree in Film Studies and I continue to indulge my passion for cinema as often as possible. Of all the places life has taken me, Iâm happiest to be back at âBerg.  
Advice for Prospective Students: Always be yourself, try to stay relaxed, and ask as many questions as youâd like. This process is about finding the best fit for you.
Favorite Food on Campus? A Bagel Bomb with bacon from the General's Quarters!

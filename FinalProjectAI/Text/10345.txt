	 Thursday, March 24, 2022  03:03 PM

The Creative & Professional Writing Program and the Department of English Literatures & Writing are bringing prose writer Laurie Stone to Muhlenberg on Thursday, April 7, for a reading and book signing. The event will take place at 7:00 pm in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum and is free and open to the public.
Stone is the author of six books, including 2022âs Streaming Now: Postcards From the Thing That Is Happening and 2020âs Everything Is Personal: Notes on Now. Stone worked as a writer for The Village Voice, a theatre critic for The Nation and as critic-at-large for NPRâs Fresh Air. She has received the Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing from the National Book Critics Circle and two grants from the New York Foundation for the Arts. 
Stoneâs appearance is part of the Writers-at-Muhlenberg series, in which established writers visit campus, attend classes, offer writing workshops and participate in readings.

Women's Soccer, Volleyball Fall to Bullets
 Saturday, October 22, 2011 - page 3







					 



The Muhlenberg women’s soccer team suffered its fourth straight loss – all by one goal – when Gettysburg scored off a corner kick with 
8:54 left for a 1-0 win.

The Bullets (10-5, 7-1), who are a game off the lead in the Centennial Conference, had a large advantage in possession but did not have many dangerous 
chances. Senior Michele Toher (left) made a diving save to her right to deny Gettysburg in the first half.

Gettysburg’s goal came on a rebound after the initial shot off the corner kick was blocked at the far post.

Muhlenberg (6-9-2, 3-5-1), playing its final road game of the season, had its best chance to tie with about three minutes left, but a long strike by sophomore Stephanie Tramutola sailed high.

Of the Mules’ nine losses, seven are by a single goal, the only exceptions being games against teams ranked in the top five in Division III.

Ten days after coming back from a 2-0 deficit to force a fifth set against defending Centennial Conference champion Franklin & Marshall, the Muhlenberg volleyball team tried to do the same thing against CC co-leader Gettysburg.

The Mules jumped out to an 8-1 lead in the third set and were still up 18-11 later on, but the Bullets came back to win, 25-23, and complete the 3-0 sweep.

Senior Davi Gordon tied for the team lead with 4 kills and added a team-high 10 digs.

Applying to Professional School
Our philosophy is that you should apply to professional school when your application is the strongest it can be. You should have a solid academic record (especially in the sciences), high standardized test scores, and lots of exposure to the field you are pursuing. You should also be engaging in research, developing leadership skills, and demonstrating your commitment to service.  All of this takes time; therefore, your timeline will be unique to you and we are here to help with your planning.
Your success is our goal! 











          Application Timeline
  








HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL APPLICANT TIMELINE
DECEMBER

If you have not yet taken your entrance exam (MCAT, DAT, GRE, OAT), decide when you will do so and develop a study plan. You should typically allow yourself three months to prepare, but the timeline will also depend on your individual study schedule. Practice tests are crucial (under test conditions!), hand-in-hand with content review. 
Begin work on the Candidate Information Google Doc and draft your essay. 
Investigate professional school admissions criteria and formulate the list of schools to which you will apply.  The MSAR, Choose DO Explorer, ADEA Dental School Explorer, and VMSAR all provide information on choosing professional schools. 
Consider who you will ask for faculty evaluations and letters of recommendation for your committee letter.
Some test prep materials may be available from the Health Professions Advising office.
If you will be abroad in the spring â speak with CailÃ­n about your interview before you leave.

 JANUARY

Request evaluations from Muhlenberg faculty for your committee letter.  A maximum of four evaluations should be requested with at least two from faculty in the sciences. 
Request 1-2 additional letters of recommendation (for example, a doctor whom you showed, an internship supervisor, or your coach/mentor.) These letters are optional but strongly encouraged (although some programs require a letter from a health professional.)  If you will be applying to osteopathic medical school, you may need a letter from a DO. 
Complete the Candidate Information Google Doc. 
Submit your Request for Committee Letter.
Schedule an interview with CailÃ­n. Interview times will be available during February, March and April and are scheduled for an hour.  Bring any questions you have to this interview.  Be prepared to discuss your essay, extracurricular activities, and health related experiences.

 FEBRUARY, MARCH and APRIL

Continue reviewing for your standardized test and register for the exam (if you have not yet taken it.)
Interview with CailÃ­n for your committee letter.
Continue working on and revising your personal statement.

MAY

Mandatory attendance at the âApplication Workshop, Part IIâ, an informational session on AMCAS/ AACOMAS/AADSAS/OptomCAS and timelines for summer action items (DATE/TIME TBA).
As soon as spring grades are available, arrange with the Registrar to have copies of your official transcript sent to the application services.  (You must provide the Registrar with the form generated by the application service.)  If you have completed ANY courses outside of Muhlenberg (including college courses you received credit for in high school), request transcripts from those schools also.
Your committee letter cannot be written unless all Muhlenberg Faculty evaluations are received, as well as any additional letters.  If you intend to submit your AACOMAS application prior to June 1st, inform your evaluators and letter-writers. 
Finalize your personal statement.        
Once classes end, begin working on your AMCAS/AACOMAS/AADSAS/OptomCAS applications.
Take the DAT or OAT by the end of this month if you havenât taken it yet.  Youâll need 90 days between testing dates if you need to retake this exam (so you can retake it before returning to campus in the fall.)

JUNE

Submit AMCAS/AACOMAS/AADSAS/OptomCAS as soon as you are secure with your MCAT/DAT/OAT scores and know definitively whether or not you need to retake the test.
E-mail an electronic copy of your submitted application to the Health Professions Advising office -  immediately after you have submitted it online. 

 
 *** Your Committee Letter will not be prepared until a copy of your submitted application and ALL of your evaluations and letters have been received by CailÃ­n. ***
SUMMER

Your goal should be to complete all secondary/supplemental applications before returning to campus in late August.  This puts you in the best possible position to be granted early fall interviews. 
If any of your schools require the CASPer  (Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics) test, schedule a date to take it as soon as possible. A good number of the schools that Muhlenberg students typically apply to require this assessment.

AUGUST onward
Inform CailÃ­n of all interviews, acceptances and admittances as you receive them with this FORM

The Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students
Successful medical school applicants are able to demonstrate skills, knowledge, and abilities in these areas. As youâll see in the Anatomy of An Applicant student profiles, one experience can illustrate proficiency across multiple competencies.

Here at Muhlenberg the Health Professions Advising office partners with the Career Center each year to plan an event called "Doc Mocks" where alumni physicians and dentists conduct mock interviews with students/alumni who are current applicants.
AAMC also provides information and tips to help you prepare for the medical school interview, one of the most important phases of the application process. Please use this link for more information on the AAMC website: Preparing for Interviews

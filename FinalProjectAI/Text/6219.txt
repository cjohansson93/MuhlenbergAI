Men's Basketball Mighty Impressive in Scotty Wood Final
 Saturday, November 19, 2011







					 



Muhlenberg senior Spencer Liddic shook so many hands at midcourt during Scotty Wood Weekend, he could have run for mayor of Memorial Hall.

On Friday, he was honored at halftime of the women’s game for being an Academic All-American and before the 




Killing became the first Mule freshman to score 30 points in a game since 2003-04.



men’s game for breaking the school single-season scoring record. And then on Saturday, he once again was at the center of two presentations, picking up his second straight MVP trophy and, most importantly, the second consecutive team trophy for the Mule men’s basketball team.

Liddic notched his third straight double-double to start the season with 21 points and 16 rebounds, leading Muhlenberg to a 99-83 win against Immaculata in the championship game of the 30th Scotty Wood Tournament.

“It’s exciting,” said Liddic, the fourth Mule to win 

back-to-back Scotty Wood MVP awards. “It’s such a great tournament, with all its history, and to come in and win it three of my four years is an amazing thing.”

Liddic was not the only Muhlenberg player to put up amazing numbers in the championship game. He was joined on the all-tournament team by freshman Malique Killing (30 points, six assists, four steals) and sophomore Austin Curry (20 points).

Liddic, Killing and Curry were the first trio of Mules 

to each score 20 points in a game since February 1992, when Dennis Adams (25), Matt Kelly (21) and Jim Hitchcock (20) did it in an overtime loss to Lebanon Valley. 

Freshman AJ Dean added 13 points as Muhlenberg came 




Dean averaged 12.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists in the two tournament games and recorded his first career dunk
in the second half against Immaculata.



within one point of reaching triple digits in consecutive games for the first time in 43 years. The Mules set a Scotty Wood Tournament record with 199 points in two games.

“It’s great to see Muhlenberg now have a balanced attack. We have a great point guard, great shooting guards and great forwards,” said Liddic. “All around I feel like it’s the first time we’ve had a balanced attack.”

The attack was not quite so balanced in the first half, when Killing scored 21 of his 30 points. He shot 7-of-9 from the field in the first 20 minutes, blending an assortment of crowd-pleasing off-balance drives with long three-pointers. Killing hit four three-pointers in a span of 2:17 late in the half, helping stretch Muhlenberg’s lead from 32-24 to 47-29. 

“He is such a special and gifted player,” said Liddic of his new teammate. “I take such pleasure in watching the way he plays and the way he competes.”

Killing’s pace slowed down in the second half, but the Mules, who scored the first 10 points of the game, had no trouble holding off the Mighty Macs (1-2) to wrap up a five-day stretch in which they won their first three games of the season.

“I’m not surprised [at the quick start],” said Liddic. “I know we have a very talented team. Coach keeps saying that in February we’ll be a finished product. It’s great to see the young guys come together and play so well early on.”

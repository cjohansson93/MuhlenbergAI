Center for Ethics speaker discusses post-war justice at Muhlenberg College



The conclusion of a war may often become a source of more conflict. Putting post-war justice theories into practice is often more difficult than governments and societies expect, and guest lecturer Brian Orend will explain why in his discussion titled "Post-War Justice."


	 Monday, February 20, 2017  09:28 AM

âAs part of Muhlenbergâs Center For Ethics program on War & Peacebuilding, Orend will give a lecture on Feb. 20 at 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum.
In his lecture, he will focus on historical cases such as the World Wars, the Iraq wars and the Serb wars, while considering major post-war justice theories. The outcomes of these conflicts will be analyzed and implications for the present and the future will be discussed, both regionally and globally. Orend will also compare and contrast Retribution and Rehabilitation policies as well as explore Occupation Law.
Orend is a professor of philosophy and the director of international studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University and has taught at the University of Lund in Sweden, where he was Distinguished Visiting Professor of Human Rights.
In addition, Orend has authored six books, and is in the process of publishing two more. His most acclaimed work, The Morality of War, has been very well-received and the updated second edition has earned high praise for being "splendidâ¦easily the most important work, in its field, in a generation."
Upcoming spring Center for Ethics events include:
Pete Giugni presentation and discussion, âHumanitarian Operations in Insecure EnvironmentsâMarch 14, 7 p.m., Location TBD
Giugni, Protection of Civilians Delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for the Regional Delegation of the United States and Canada, will give a brief presentation and be part of an open discussion that explores his experience of helping to facilitate humanitarian aid in multiple combat zones around the world. He joined the ICRC in 2004 and has worked in various protection and managerial roles in India (Kashmir), Afghanistan (Kandahar, Khost and Faryab), the Philippines (Mindanao) and Tajikistan (Dushanbe).
Michael Kazin lecture, âShould the U.S. Have Fought in World War Oneâ
âMarch 28, 7 p.m. in Moyer Hallâs Miller Forum
Kazin, author of the recently released "War Against War," will examine the debate over whether the U.S. should prepare for and then declare war on Imperial Germany, which was one of the most contentious and significant in American history. In the early spring of 1917, President Woodrow Wilson reluctantly sided with the pro-war party, and large majorities in Congress endorsed his stand.  A century later, it is difficult to defend what they did.

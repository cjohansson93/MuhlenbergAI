Muhlenberg College Art Professor To Exhibit Work In New York City



Carol Heft, who teaches drawing, painting and art history at Muhlenberg College, will present her seventh solo exhibition, âA Faceless Placeâ a combination of sculpture, drawings and paintings, at the Blue Mountain Gallery in New York City. 


	 Wednesday, September 14, 2005  01:59 PM

With her recent work, Heft uses a combination of color, value and tone to produce “drawings in the round.” Whimsical, organic structures inhabit the gallery, which is transformed into an imaginative zone between two and three-dimensional space. The exhibition is a playful exploration of gesture and movement, object and subject, spirit and idea.
Carol Heft is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, and has lived and worked in New York since 1976. In addition to teaching at Muhlenberg she works with New York City public school students as a teaching artist and mentor with Arts Connection and Studio in a School.
“A Faceless Place” runs from October 4, 2005 through October 29, 2005, with an opening reception on Saturday October 8 from 3 –5 p.m. A free concert will be performed by the Bill Warfield Quartet at the gallery from 5 –7 p.m., and is open to the public. The Blue Mountain Gallery is located at 530 West 25 th Street, 4 th Floor. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 12 – 6 p.m.

The Muhlenberg Scholars Honors Program is designed to nurture talented students by providing a rich and stimulating environment in which they can pursue their fullest academic potential.  Through innovative course offerings and a close student-faculty interaction, the program develops studentsâ capacities as knowledge producers and collaborative researchers. The goal is to create a community of inquiry where the free exchange of ideas and interdisciplinary learning lead to new insight into oneâs self and oneâs world.
The curricular component involves a sequence of courses that build studentsâ skills as scholars and thinkers. The extra-curricular component involves attending various social and dinner events, as well as bringing to campus and meeting with student-selected speakers and performers. Together, these components provide an enriching set of opportunities and experiences that help students take charge of their intellectual, social, and cultural development so that they may build a more rewarding future for themselves.

MENS BASKETBALL LIGHTS IT UP
 


It may have been the second night to light the menorah for those celebrating Hanukkah, but for the Muhlenberg mens basketball team, it was a second chance to light up Moravian this season.

The Mules did just that, traveling to Bethlehem to knock off the Greyhounds 74-55 after defeating them in the consolation of the Scotty Wood Tournament earlier in the year.




Freshman Matt OHara dished out five of Muhlenbergs season-high 20 assists.



And though the first win helped Muhlenberg (5-3) save face in its season-opening tournament, this one may have been even bigger, considering the Mules recent struggles (2-6 in their previous eight trips) at Moravian.

Its always so much better to get a road win, especially here, where there are so many fans for the Muhlenberg-Moravian game, said senior Ryan Foster. After last year we knew they were a completely different team here, and we prepared for it and handled their pressure well.

It didnt appear that way when the Mules turned it over on their first possession, but they settled down and a built an early 13-4 lead. Senior Peter Barnes threw down two highlight-reel dunks in the early going, slamming a missed layup and then finishing an alley-oop on consecutive possessions.

Hes just incredible, said Foster. Watching Peter dunk on people is always a lot of fun.

Moravian (1-7) fought back to cut the deficit to just one at 17-16, but another thunderous Barnes dunk with 32 seconds to play capped a 19-8 Muhlenberg run. The Mules entered the break leading 36-26 on the strength of hot shooting (51.7 percent from the field) and outstanding defense, holding the Greyhounds to just five field goals on 16.7 percent shooting.

We held them to five baskets, but we gave them 19 free throws and 11 offensive rebounds, said Foster. We should have had a bigger lead, and coach told us to focus on improving those without losing sight of what got us the lead in the first place.

The Mules not only improved on those numbers and continued their great shooting (50.0 percent) in the second half, they also came out of halftime ready to run. 

With a fast-paced transition game working, Muhlenberg outscored Moravian 28-9 in the first 9:12 of the second period. After a Greyhound jumper made it 51-35, the Mules went on a 13-0 run, highlighted by easy layups by senior Obi Nwizugbo in transition on great feeds from senior Brian Frankoski and sophomore Justin Greenstone.

In the beginning it was tough getting used to a new system where we run up and down a lot, but every game we get better at it, said Foster. It just shows we are really unselfish as a team.

Foster led Muhlenberg with 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting and eight rebounds. Barnes finished with 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting and three blocks, all in the first half. Sophomore Spencer Liddic went 6-for-6 from the free-throw line as part of a 10-point performance.

The win not only pushed the Mules winning streak to four, it also gave Muhlenberg a remarkable 7-2 lead in the Matte Award standings in 2009-10.

We knew about it coming in, said Foster. We didnt want to be the team that let them back into it.

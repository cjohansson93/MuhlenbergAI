Volleyball Splits Pair at Kean

The Muhlenberg volleyball team split two matches on the first day of the Kean Invitational, losing to the host school in four sets before rebounding to sweep Alvernia.

Sophomore Lindsey Gambocurta led the Mules (13-8) with 21 kills in the two matches, one more than freshman Joanne Josephson. 
Freshman Chelsea Kaser totaled 29 digs, bringing her season total to an even 300. She is only the third freshman in program history to record 300
digs in a season.

The opening match was tight throughout the first three sets. Muhlenberg trailed 22-19 in the opener before reeling off the final six points, two on kills at the 
net by freshman Sarah Weyhmuller (left). The Mules nearly pulled off another late rally in the second set, cutting a 22-16 deficit to one
before the Cougars (17-6) put down the final point to win, 25-23.

Behind the serving of freshman Taylor Grbelja, Muhlenberg jumped out to a 7-1 lead in the third set, but Kean recovered to tie the score at 13. The
set was tied for the final time at 22-all before the Cougars scored the final three points. Kean pulled away late to take the fourth set.

For the first time since 2008, the Mules had four players reach double figures in kills. Gambocurta and Weyhmuller led the way with 12 apiece, with Josephson adding
nine and sophomore Holly Hynson eight. Gambocurta also had 13 digs for her first career double-double. Freshman Vanessa Pulice
ran the offense, recording a career-high 40 assists.

Against Alvernia, Muhlenberg closed out the first set on a 10-4 run to win, 25-22. The Mules did not trailed in the final two sets, winning 25-21 and 25-18. Hynson
ended the match with a solo block.

Gambocurta and Josephson recorded nine kills apiece, and freshman Erin Murphy tied her career high with six. For the second time in seven matches,
the Mules did not allow a service ace.

The sweep of Alvernia extended Muhlenberg’s winning streak in neutral-site matches to six, dating back to last year.

You can identify your admissions counselor by checking below. We look forward to your application for admission and we hope that we'll connect with you soon.
You can schedule a virtual chat with your counselor below. Virtual chats are your opportunity to tell us what you want to learn more about and ask any question you have about Muhlenberg.
If you'd like an admissions interview, you can schedule one here or by calling 484-664-3200. Interviews are our chance to ask you questions to learn about your talents and plans and answer any questions you may have, too.

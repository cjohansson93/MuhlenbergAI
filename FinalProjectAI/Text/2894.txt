HACKER NAMED ALL-REGION
 


Senior Kasey Hacker of the Muhlenberg womens soccer team was named to the National Soccer Coaches Association of America All-Mid Atlantic second team.

Hacker, a first-team All-Centennial Conference selection two years in a row, scored five goals, second on the Mules, to go along with two assists. She led Muhlenberg with three game-winning goals.

For her career, Hacker ranked ninth in school history in career goals (56) and eighth in both goals (21) and assists (14). She played in every Muhlenberg game over the last four years, starting all but one.

Hacker is the first all-region selection for the Mules since 2005. Before that, Muhlenberg had at least one all-region pick for nine straight seasons from 1997-2005.

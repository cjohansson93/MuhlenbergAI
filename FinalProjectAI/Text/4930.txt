ALLENTOWN GIRLS LEARN FROM MULES
 


Muhlenberg celebrated National Girls and Women in Sports Day yesterday by inviting more than 50 inner-city girls from the Allentown community to Memorial Hall and Deitrich Field House.



The girls, who ranged in age from first to 10th grade, rotated among seven stations to learn from Muhlenberg's female athletes. Members of the soccer, volleyball, field hockey, lacrosse, track, softball and tennis teams taught the girls the basics of their sports and afterwards taught them about healthy exercise and eating habits. 

 "I always love the event - it's my third year doing it," said junior Caitlin Dombkowski of the volleyball team. "We don't know how often these girls play sports, but we hope it makes them play more. There was one girl who was saying she always sucks at everything, and she was actually doing well. Maybe they don't have a lot of people to tell them they are good at things, but we can.

"It's also nice because it gives us a chance to interact with the Allentown community. Hopefully this gets these girls to see college life in a different way."

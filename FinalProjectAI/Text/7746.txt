Golf Teams Wrap Up Fall with Busy Three Days
 Monday, October 13, 2014 - page 2







					 





Three days, five rounds, 18,801 yards and two first-place finishes – that was the story for the Muhlenberg golf teams
as they finished up their fall seasons.

The women began the busy stretch on Saturday by competing in a three-way match with Lebanon Valley and Wilkes at Eagle
Rock Resort near Hazleton, Pa. The Mules won by 25 strokes.

Senior Christina Bryde (right) led Muhlenberg and was second overall with a 97, one stroke better than sophomore
Emily Unrue. Senior Laura Glogovsky also finished in the top half, finishing with a 103.

Both teams then traveled to Patriots Glen National Golf Club in Elkton, Md., for the two-day Revolutionary Collegiate
Classic, hosted by Ursinus.

The men easily won their half of the three-team tournament by 58 strokes over Ursinus. It was the third time this fall that
the Mules finished first in an event with at least three teams.

Junior Jonathan Graulich recorded his first career first-place finish, shooting a 6-over-par 150 over 36
holes to edge freshman Daniel Eidman by a stroke. Eidman carded a 74 in the first round, and Graulich (left)
matched it in the second.

Sophomore John Froberg also shot in the 70s both days and came in fourth at 153.

The women were third out of five teams. Despite playing for the third consecutive day, they improved their score by six
strokes from the first round to the second. Bryde (eighth with a 188) and Unrue (ninth with a 193) again led Muhlenberg.

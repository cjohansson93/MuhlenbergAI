Emily Anabeth Hoolihan  Class of 2017Major in TheatreMinor in Music & Jewish Studies
Lead Development Manager, National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene, New York





Emily has found the perfect job for putting her Theatre major and her double-minors in Music and Jewish Studies to use â at the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene, in Battery Park City, New York, where sheâs been working for the past nine months.
âNYTF has been the perfect fit with my Muhlenberg education,â she says. âI began as an unpaid intern and now, after much perseverance and a bit of luck, Iâm the lead Development Manager for the company. I work closely with our donors and board members, raising money for our programming.
âOver the past few months, Iâve been working to raise support for our largest production yet â the U.S. premiere of Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish. I have also performed with them as an actor, most recently in The Sorceress, a restored operetta in Yiddish by Avram Goldfaden, this past December.
âAs I grew with this company, I realized I wanted to take my passion for music, Judaism, and artistry a step further. On June 4, 2018, I am moving to Jerusalem to begin my journey towards becoming a Cantor in the Reform movement of Judaism. I was accepted to Hebrew Union College â Jewish Institute of Religion in March for their Cantorial Studies program. The program is one year in Israel and four in New York City. I canât wait to continue my education and to share my love of artistry and Judaism with the world â and Muhlenbergâs Theatre & Dance Department encouraged my passion for both.â

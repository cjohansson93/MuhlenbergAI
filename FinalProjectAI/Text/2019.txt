Research Interests In my lab we focus on two distinct, but related areas, plant-insect interactions and conservation biology and sustainable development.  Our studies of plant-insect interactions are focused on how abiotic and biotic environmental factors influence insect herbivory as mediated through leaf defensive chemistry. In the area of conservation biology and sustainable development, we are focused on developing ecologically integrated, urban food productions systems including the devleopment of urban aquaculture systems. We have also established a long-term, interdisciplinary research project in Abangares, Costa Rica where we are examining the environmental, cultural and public health aspects of artisinal goldmining. I currently have a book in progress on this topic with photographer Joseph Elliot. I am currently writing a book for Oxford Univeristy Press entitled Sustainable Solutions: Problem Solving for Current and Future Generations.

Golf teams third, fifth 




The Muhlenberg golf teams finished third (men) and fifth (women) at the Centennial Conference Championships.

The men rallied in the third and final round, shooting a 308 to tie for the lowest round in the tournament. The 308 was the lowest score ever for Muhlenberg in the third round of the CC Championships. All five Mules shot in the 70s, led by sophomore Jordan Carpenter (right), who carded a 75.

The great final round pushed Muhlenberg from fifth place to third, two strokes behind second-place McDaniel and 14 back of Franklin & Marshall, which won its third title.

Sophomore Zachary Oyer missed all-conference by one place, tying for sixth with a 54-hole total of 236. Senior Bill Snow took 238 strokes over the three rounds.

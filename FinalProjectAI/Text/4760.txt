Cross Country first team, as chosen by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

Torphy is the 19th first-team Academic All-American in College history, but the first to be named after his junior year since football player Joe Zeszotarski in 1989.

A third-team Academic All-American last year, Torphy is the eighth Muhlenberg athlete  the first from the track and field and cross country programs  to earn Academic All-America honors more than once.

Torphy, a biochemistry major, qualified for the NCAA Championships in both cross country and indoor track and field in 2009-10. He earned all-region honors in cross country by finishing 22nd at the NCAA Mideast Regional and earned two silver medals and a bronze at the Centennial Conference track and field championship meets.

At the NCAA Indoor Championships, Torphy received the prestigious Elite 88 award, given to the student-athlete with the highest grade-point average competing at the finals site of each of the NCAAs 88 Championships.

Torphy earned All-America honors on the distance medley relay team that placed fourth at the 2009 NCAA Division III Indoor Championships. He holds the indoor school record in the 800 and contributed to records in the DMR and 4x800. For his career, Torphy has four gold medals, four silvers and five bronzes at CC track meets.
